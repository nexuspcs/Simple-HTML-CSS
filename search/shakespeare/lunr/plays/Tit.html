<h3>SCENE I.  Rome. Before the Capitol.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">The Tomb of the ANDRONICI appearing; the Tribunes
and Senators aloft. Enter, below, from one side,
SATURNINUS and his Followers; and, from the other
side, BASSIANUS and his Followers; with drum and colours</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SATURNINUS</li>
  <li>Noble patricians, patrons of my right,</li>
  <li>Defend the justice of my cause with arms,</li>
  <li>And, countrymen, my loving followers,</li>
  <li>Plead my successive title with your swords:</li>
  <li class="number">I am his first-born son, that was the last</li>
  <li>That wore the imperial diadem of Rome;</li>
  <li>Then let my father's honours live in me,</li>
  <li>Nor wrong mine age with this indignity.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BASSIANUS</li>
  <li>Romans, friends, followers, favorers of my right,</li>
  <li class="number">If ever Bassianus, Caesar's son,</li>
  <li>Were gracious in the eyes of royal Rome,</li>
  <li>Keep then this passage to the Capitol</li>
  <li>And suffer not dishonour to approach</li>
  <li>The imperial seat, to virtue consecrate,</li>
  <li class="number">To justice, continence and nobility;</li>
  <li>But let desert in pure election shine,</li>
  <li>And, Romans, fight for freedom in your choice.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter MARCUS ANDRONICUS, aloft, with the crown</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MARCUS ANDRONICUS</li>
  <li>Princes, that strive by factions and by friends</li>
  <li>Ambitiously for rule and empery,</li>
  <li class="number">Know that the people of Rome, for whom we stand</li>
  <li>A special party, have, by common voice,</li>
  <li>In election for the Roman empery,</li>
  <li>Chosen Andronicus, surnamed Pius</li>
  <li>For many good and great deserts to Rome:</li>
  <li class="number">A nobler man, a braver warrior,</li>
  <li>Lives not this day within the city walls:</li>
  <li>He by the senate is accit'd home</li>
  <li>From weary wars against the barbarous Goths;</li>
  <li>That, with his sons, a terror to our foes,</li>
  <li class="number">Hath yoked a nation strong, train'd up in arms.</li>
  <li>Ten years are spent since first he undertook</li>
  <li>This cause of Rome and chastised with arms</li>
  <li>Our enemies' pride: five times he hath return'd</li>
  <li>Bleeding to Rome, bearing his valiant sons</li>
  <li class="number">In coffins from the field;</li>
  <li>And now at last, laden with horror's spoils,</li>
  <li>Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,</li>
  <li>Renowned Titus, flourishing in arms.</li>
  <li>Let us entreat, by honour of his name,</li>
  <li class="number">Whom worthily you would have now succeed.</li>
  <li>And in the Capitol and senate's right,</li>
  <li>Whom you pretend to honour and adore,</li>
  <li>That you withdraw you and abate your strength;</li>
  <li>Dismiss your followers and, as suitors should,</li>
  <li class="number">Plead your deserts in peace and humbleness.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SATURNINUS</li>
  <li>How fair the tribune speaks to calm my thoughts!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BASSIANUS</li>
  <li>Marcus Andronicus, so I do ally</li>
  <li>In thy uprightness and integrity,</li>

  <li class="number">Thy noble brother Titus and his sons,</li>
  <li>And her to whom my thoughts are humbled all,</li>
  <li>Gracious Lavinia, Rome's rich ornament,</li>
  <li>That I will here dismiss my loving friends,</li>
  <li>And to my fortunes and the people's favor</li>

  <li>Romans, make way: the good Andronicus.</li>
  <li class="number">Patron of virtue, Rome's best champion,</li>
  <li>Successful in the battles that he fights,</li>
  <li>With honour and with fortune is return'd</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Drums and trumpets sounded. Enter MARTIUS and
MUTIUS; After them, two Men bearing a coffin
covered with black; then LUCIUS and QUINTUS. After
them, TITUS ANDRONICUS; and then TAMORA, with
ALARBUS, DEMETRIUS, CHIRON, AARON, and other Goths,
prisoners; Soldiers and people following. The
Bearers set down the coffin, and TITUS speaks</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TITUS ANDRONICUS</li>
  <li class="number">Hail, Rome, victorious in thy mourning weeds!</li>
  <li>Lo, as the bark, that hath discharged her fraught,</li>
  <li>Returns with precious jading to the bay</li>
  <li>From whence at first she weigh'd her anchorage,</li>
  <li>Cometh Andronicus, bound with laurel boughs,</li>
  <li class="number">To re-salute his country with his tears,</li>
  <li>Tears of true joy for his return to Rome.</li>
  <li>Thou great defender of this Capitol,</li>
  <li>Stand gracious to the rites that we intend!</li>
  <li>Romans, of five and twenty valiant sons,</li>
  <li class="number">Half of the number that King Priam had,</li>
  <li>Behold the poor remains, alive and dead!</li>
  <li>These that survive let Rome reward with love;</li>
  <li>These that I bring unto their latest home,</li>
  <li>With burial amongst their ancestors:</li>
  <li class="number">Here Goths have given me leave to sheathe my sword.</li>
  <li>Titus, unkind and careless of thine own,</li>
  <li>Why suffer'st thou thy sons, unburied yet,</li>
  <li>To hover on the dreadful shore of Styx?</li>
  <li>Make way to lay them by their brethren.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">The tomb is opened</li>
  <li class="number">There greet in silence, as the dead are wont,</li>
  <li>And sleep in peace, slain in your country's wars!</li>
  <li>O sacred receptacle of my joys,</li>
  <li>Sweet cell of virtue and nobility,</li>
  <li>How many sons of mine hast thou in store,</li>
  <li class="number">That thou wilt never render to me more!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LUCIUS</li>
  <li>Give us the proudest prisoner of the Goths,</li>
  <li>That we may hew his limbs, and on a pile</li>
  <li>Ad manes fratrum sacrifice his flesh,</li>
  <li>Before this earthy prison of their bones;</li>
  <li class="number">That so the shadows be not unappeased,</li>
  <li>Nor we disturb'd with prodigies on earth.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TITUS ANDRONICUS</li>
  <li>I give him you, the noblest that survives,</li>
  <li>The eldest son of this distressed queen.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TAMORA</li>
  <li>Stay, Roman brethren! Gracious conqueror,</li>
  <li class="number">Victorious Titus, rue the tears I shed,</li>
  <li>A mother's tears in passion for her son:</li>
  <li>And if thy sons were ever dear to thee,</li>
  <li>O, think my son to be as dear to me!</li>
  <li>Sufficeth not that we are brought to Rome,</li>
  <li class="number">To beautify thy triumphs and return,</li>
  <li>Captive to thee and to thy Roman yoke,</li>
  <li>But must my sons be slaughter'd in the streets,</li>
  <li>For valiant doings in their country's cause?</li>
  <li>O, if to fight for king and commonweal</li>
  <li class="number">Were piety in thine, it is in these.</li>
  <li>Andronicus, stain not thy tomb with blood:</li>
  <li>Wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods?</li>
  <li>Draw near them then in being merciful:</li>
  <li>Sweet mercy is nobility's true badge:</li>
  <li class="number">Thrice noble Titus, spare my first-born son.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TITUS ANDRONICUS</li>
  <li>Patient yourself, madam, and pardon me.</li>
  <li>These are their brethren, whom you Goths beheld</li>
  <li>Alive and dead, and for their brethren slain</li>
  <li>Religiously they ask a sacrifice:</li>
  <li class="number">To this your son is mark'd, and die he must,</li>
  <li>To appease their groaning shadows that are gone.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LUCIUS</li>
  <li>Away with him! and make a fire straight;</li>
  <li>And with our swords, upon a pile of wood,</li>
  <li>Let's hew his limbs till they be clean consumed.</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt LUCIUS, QUINTUS, MARTIUS, and MUTIUS, with ALARBUS</div>

  <li class="speaker">TAMORA</li>
  <li class="number">O cruel, irreligious piety!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CHIRON</li>
  <li>Was ever Scythia half so barbarous?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DEMETRIUS</li>
  <li>Oppose not Scythia to ambitious Rome.</li>
  <li>Alarbus goes to rest; and we survive</li>
  <li>To tremble under Titus' threatening looks.</li>
  <li class="number">Then, madam, stand resolved, but hope withal</li>
  <li>The self-same gods that arm'd the Queen of Troy</li>
  <li>With opportunity of sharp revenge</li>
  <li>Upon the Thracian tyrant in his tent,</li>
  <li>May favor Tamora, the Queen of Goths â€” </li>
  <li class="number">When Goths were Goths and Tamora was queen â€” </li>
  <li>To quit the bloody wrongs upon her foes.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Re-enter LUCIUS, QUINTUS, MARTIUS and MUTIUS, with
their swords bloody</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LUCIUS</li>
  <li>See, lord and father, how we have perform'd</li>
  <li>Our Roman rites: Alarbus' limbs are lopp'd,</li>
  <li>And entrails feed the sacrificing fire,</li>
  <li class="number">Whose smoke, like incense, doth perfume the sky.</li>
  <li>Remaineth nought, but to inter our brethren,</li>
  <li>And with loud 'larums welcome them to Rome.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TITUS ANDRONICUS</li>
  <li>Let it be so; and let Andronicus</li>
  <li>Make this his latest farewell to their souls.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Trumpets sounded, and the coffin laid in the tomb</li>
  <li class="number">In peace and honour rest you here, my sons;</li>
  <li>Rome's readiest champions, repose you here in rest,</li>
  <li>Secure from worldly chances and mishaps!</li>
  <li>Here lurks no treason, here no envy swells,</li>
  <li>Here grow no damned grudges; here are no storms,</li>
  <li class="number">No noise, but silence and eternal sleep:</li>
  <li>In peace and honour rest you here, my sons!</li>

  <li>Lo, at this tomb my tributary tears</li>
  <li class="number">I render, for my brethren's obsequies;</li>
  <li>And at thy feet I kneel, with tears of joy,</li>
  <li>Shed on the earth, for thy return to Rome:</li>

  <li class="speaker">MARCUS ANDRONICUS</li>
  <li>And welcome, nephews, from successful wars,</li>
  <li>You that survive, and you that sleep in fame!</li>
  <li>Fair lords, your fortunes are alike in all,</li>
  <li class="number">That in your country's service drew your swords:</li>
  <li>But safer triumph is this funeral pomp,</li>
  <li>That hath aspired to Solon's happiness</li>
  <li>And triumphs over chance in honour's bed.</li>
  <li>Titus Andronicus, the people of Rome,</li>
  <li class="number">Whose friend in justice thou hast ever been,</li>
  <li>Send thee by me, their tribune and their trust,</li>
  <li>This palliament of white and spotless hue;</li>

  <li>With these our late-deceased emperor's sons:</li>
  <li class="number">Be candidatus then, and put it on,</li>
  <li>And help to set a head on headless Rome.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TITUS ANDRONICUS</li>
  <li>A better head her glorious body fits</li>
  <li>Than his that shakes for age and feebleness:</li>
  <li>What should I don this robe, and trouble you?</li>
  <li class="number">Be chosen with proclamations to-day,</li>
  <li>To-morrow yield up rule, resign my life,</li>
  <li>And set abroad new business for you all?</li>
  <li>Rome, I have been thy soldier forty years,</li>
  <li>And led my country's strength successfully,</li>
  <li class="number">And buried one and twenty valiant sons,</li>
  <li>Knighted in field, slain manfully in arms,</li>
  <li>In right and service of their noble country</li>
  <li>Give me a staff of honour for mine age,</li>
  <li>But not a sceptre to control the world:</li>
  <li class="number">Upright he held it, lords, that held it last.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MARCUS ANDRONICUS</li>
  <li>Titus, thou shalt obtain and ask the empery.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BASSIANUS</li>
  <li>Andronicus, I do not flatter thee,</li>

  <li>I will most thankful be; and thanks to men</li>
  <li>Of noble minds is honourable meed.</li>

  <li class="number">My lords, a solemn hunting is in hand;</li>
  <li>There will the lovely Roman ladies troop:</li>

  <li>Come, come, our empress, with her sacred wit</li>
  <li>To villany and vengeance consecrate,</li>
  <li class="number">Will we acquaint with all that we intend;</li>
  <li>And she shall file our engines with advice,</li>

  <li>The emperor's court is like the house of Fame,</li>

  <li class="number">A thousand fiends, a thousand hissing snakes,</li>

  <li>Hear me, grave fathers! noble tribunes, stay!</li>
  <li>For pity of mine age, whose youth was spent</li>
  <li>In dangerous wars, whilst you securely slept;</li>
  <li>For all my blood in Rome's great quarrel shed;</li>
  <li class="number">For all the frosty nights that I have watch'd;</li>
  <li>And for these bitter tears, which now you see</li>
  <li>Filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks;</li>
  <li>Be pitiful to my condemned sons,</li>
  <li>Whose souls are not corrupted as 'tis thought.</li>
  <li class="number">For two and twenty sons I never wept,</li>
  <li>Because they died in honour's lofty bed.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Lieth down; the Judges, &c., pass by him, and Exeunt</li>
  <li>For these, these, tribunes, in the dust I write</li>
  <li>My heart's deep languor and my soul's sad tears:</li>
  <li>Let my tears stanch the earth's dry appetite;</li>
  <li class="number">My sons' sweet blood will make it shame and blush.</li>
  <li>O earth, I will befriend thee more with rain,</li>
  <li>That shall distil from these two ancient urns,</li>
  <li>Than youthful April shall with all his showers:</li>
  <li>In summer's drought I'll drop upon thee still;</li>
  <li class="number">In winter with warm tears I'll melt the snow</li>
  <li>And keep eternal spring-time on thy face,</li>
  <li>So thou refuse to drink my dear sons' blood.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Enter LUCIUS, with his sword drawn</li>
  <li>O reverend tribunes! O gentle, aged men!</li>
  <li>Unbind my sons, reverse the doom of death;</li>
  <li class="number">And let me say, that never wept before,</li>
  <li>My tears are now prevailing orators.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LUCIUS</li>
  <li>O noble father, you lament in vain:</li>
  <li>The tribunes hear you not; no man is by;</li>
  <li>And you recount your sorrows to a stone.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TITUS ANDRONICUS</li>
  <li class="number">Ah, Lucius, for thy brothers let me plead.</li>
  <li>Grave tribunes, once more I entreat of you â€”  </li>

  <li class="speaker">LUCIUS</li>
  <li>My gracious lord, no tribune hears you speak.</li>

  <li>Why, tis no matter, man; if they did hear,</li>
  <li>They would not mark me, or if they did mark,</li>
  <li class="number">They would not pity me, yet plead I must;</li>
  <li>And bootless unto them.</li>
  <li>Therefore I tell my sorrows to the stones;</li>
  <li>Who, though they cannot answer my distress,</li>
  <li>Yet in some sort they are better than the tribunes,</li>
  <li class="number">For that they will not intercept my tale:</li>
  <li>When I do weep, they humbly at my feet</li>
  <li>Receive my tears and seem to weep with me;</li>
  <li>And, were they but attired in grave weeds,</li>
  <li>Rome could afford no tribune like to these.</li>
  <li class="number">A stone is soft as wax â€”  tribunes more hard than stones;</li>
  <li>A stone is silent, and offendeth not,</li>
  <li>And tribunes with their tongues doom men to death.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Rises</li>
  <li>But wherefore stand'st thou with thy weapon drawn?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LUCIUS</li>

  <li class="number">Tigers must prey, and Rome affords no prey</li>
  <li>But me and mine: how happy art thou, then,</li>
  <li>From these devourers to be banished!</li>
  <li>But who comes with our brother Marcus here?</li>

  <li>Faint-hearted boy, arise, and look upon her.</li>
  <li>Speak, Lavinia, what accursed hand</li>
  <li>Hath made thee handless in thy father's sight?</li>
  <li>What fool hath added water to the sea,</li>
  <li class="number">Or brought a faggot to bright-burning Troy?</li>
  <li>My grief was at the height before thou camest,</li>
  <li>And now like Nilus, it disdaineth bounds.</li>
  <li>Give me a sword, I'll chop off my hands too;</li>
  <li>For they have fought for Rome, and all in vain;</li>
  <li class="number">And they have nursed this woe, in feeding life;</li>
  <li>In bootless prayer have they been held up,</li>
  <li>And they have served me to effectless use:</li>
  <li>Now all the service I require of them</li>
  <li>Is that the one will help to cut the other.</li>
  <li class="number">'Tis well, Lavinia, that thou hast no hands;</li>
  <li>For hands, to do Rome service, are but vain.</li>

  <li>Speak, gentle sister, who hath martyr'd thee?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MARCUS ANDRONICUS</li>
  <li>O, that delightful engine of her thoughts</li>
  <li>That blabb'd them with such pleasing eloquence,</li>
  <li class="number">Is torn from forth that pretty hollow cage,</li>
  <li>Where, like a sweet melodious bird, it sung</li>
  <li>Sweet varied notes, enchanting every ear!</li>

  <li>O, say thou for her, who hath done this deed?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MARCUS ANDRONICUS</li>
  <li>O, thus I found her, straying in the park,</li>
  <li class="number">Seeking to hide herself, as doth the deer</li>
  <li>That hath received some unrecuring wound.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TITUS ANDRONICUS</li>
  <li>It was my deer; and he that wounded her</li>
  <li>Hath hurt me more than had he killed me dead:</li>
  <li>For now I stand as one upon a rock</li>
  <li class="number">Environed with a wilderness of sea,</li>
  <li>Who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave,</li>
  <li>Expecting ever when some envious surge</li>
  <li>Will in his brinish bowels swallow him.</li>
  <li>This way to death my wretched sons are gone;</li>
  <li class="number">Here stands my other son, a banished man,</li>
  <li>And here my brother, weeping at my woes.</li>
  <li>But that which gives my soul the greatest spurn,</li>
  <li>Is dear Lavinia, dearer than my soul.</li>
  <li>Had I but seen thy picture in this plight,</li>
  <li class="number">It would have madded me: what shall I do</li>
  <li>Now I behold thy lively body so?</li>
  <li>Thou hast no hands, to wipe away thy tears:</li>
  <li>Nor tongue, to tell me who hath martyr'd thee:</li>
  <li>Thy husband he is dead: and for his death</li>
  <li class="number">Thy brothers are condemn'd, and dead by this.</li>
  <li>Look, Marcus! ah, son Lucius, look on her!</li>
  <li>When I did name her brothers, then fresh tears</li>
  <li>Stood on her cheeks, as doth the honey-dew</li>
  <li>Upon a gather'd lily almost wither'd.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MARCUS ANDRONICUS</li>
  <li class="number">Perchance she weeps because they kill'd her husband;</li>
  <li>Perchance because she knows them innocent.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TITUS ANDRONICUS</li>
  <li>If they did kill thy husband, then be joyful</li>
  <li>Because the law hath ta'en revenge on them.</li>
  <li>No, no, they would not do so foul a deed;</li>
  <li class="number">Witness the sorrow that their sister makes.</li>
  <li>Gentle Lavinia, let me kiss thy lips.</li>
  <li>Or make some sign how I may do thee ease:</li>
  <li>Shall thy good uncle, and thy brother Lucius,</li>
  <li>And thou, and I, sit round about some fountain,</li>
  <li class="number">Looking all downwards to behold our cheeks</li>
  <li>How they are stain'd, as meadows, yet not dry,</li>
  <li>With miry slime left on them by a flood?</li>
  <li>And in the fountain shall we gaze so long</li>
  <li>Till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness,</li>
  <li class="number">And made a brine-pit with our bitter tears?</li>
  <li>Or shall we cut away our hands, like thine?</li>
  <li>Or shall we bite our tongues, and in dumb shows</li>
  <li>Pass the remainder of our hateful days?</li>
  <li>What shall we do? let us, that have our tongues,</li>
  <li class="number">Plot some deuce of further misery,</li>
  <li>To make us wonder'd at in time to come.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">

  <li>Marcus, unknit that sorrow-wreathen knot:</li>
  <li class="number">Thy niece and I, poor creatures, want our hands,</li>

  <li>Extremity of griefs would make men mad;</li>
  <li class="number">And I have read that Hecuba of Troy</li>
  <li>Ran mad through sorrow: that made me to fear;</li>
  <li>Although, my lord, I know my noble aunt</li>
  <li>Loves me as dear as e'er my mother did,</li>
  <li>And would not, but in fury, fright my youth:</li>
  <li class="number">Which made me down to throw my books, and fly â€” </li>

  <li>Join with the Goths; and with revengeful war</li>

  <li>No, my good lord; but Pluto sends you word,</li>

  <li>Marry, for Justice, she is so employ'd,</li>
  <li class="number">He thinks, with Jove in heaven, or somewhere else,</li>

  <li class="number">We will solicit heaven and move the gods</li>

  <li>Ha, ha!</li>
  <li>Publius, Publius, what hast thou done?</li>

  <li class="speaker">MARCUS ANDRONICUS</li>
  <li>This was the sport, my lord: when Publius shot,</li>

  <li>And who should find them but the empress' villain?</li>

<h3>SCENE IV.  The same. Before the palace.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter SATURNINUS, TAMORA, DEMETRIUS, CHIRON,
Lords, and others; SATURNINUS with the arrows in

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SATURNINUS</li>
  <li>Why, lords, what wrongs are these! was ever seen</li>
  <li>An emperor in Rome thus overborne,</li>
  <li>Troubled, confronted thus; and, for the extent</li>
  <li>Of egal justice, used in such contempt?</li>
  <li class="number">My lords, you know, as know the mightful gods,</li>
  <li>However these disturbers of our peace</li>
  <li>Buz in the people's ears, there nought hath pass'd,</li>
  <li>But even with law, against the willful sons</li>
  <li>Of old Andronicus. And what an if</li>
  <li class="number">His sorrows have so overwhelm'd his wits,</li>
  <li>Shall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks,</li>
  <li>His fits, his frenzy, and his bitterness?</li>
  <li>And now he writes to heaven for his redress:</li>
  <li>See, here's to Jove, and this to Mercury;</li>
  <li class="number">This to Apollo; this to the god of war;</li>
  <li>Sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of Rome!</li>
  <li>What's this but libelling against the senate,</li>
  <li>And blazoning our injustice every where?</li>
  <li>A goodly humour, is it not, my lords?</li>
  <li class="number">As who would say, in Rome no justice were.</li>
  <li>But if I live, his feigned ecstasies</li>
  <li>Shall be no shelter to these outrages:</li>
  <li>But he and his shall know that justice lives</li>
  <li>In Saturninus' health, whom, if she sleep,</li>
  <li class="number">He'll so awake as she in fury shall</li>

  <li class="stage-direction">Aside</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">AEMILIUS</li>
  <li>Arm, arm, my lord; â€” Rome never had more cause.</li>

  <li>As much as ever Coriolanus did.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SATURNINUS</li>
  <li>Is warlike Lucius general of the Goths?</li>
  <li class="number">These tidings nip me, and I hang the head</li>
  <li>As flowers with frost or grass beat down with storms:</li>
  <li>Ay, now begin our sorrows to approach:</li>
  <li>'Tis he the common people love so much;</li>
  <li>Myself hath often over-heard them say,</li>
  <li class="number">When I have walked like a private man,</li>
  <li>That Lucius' banishment was wrongfully,</li>

  <li class="speaker">SATURNINUS</li>
  <li>Ay, but the citizens favor Lucius,</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TAMORA</li>
  <li>King, be thy thoughts imperious, like thy name.</li>
  <li>Is the sun dimm'd, that gnats do fly in it?</li>
  <li>The eagle suffers little birds to sing,</li>
  <li>And is not careful what they mean thereby,</li>
  <li class="number">Knowing that with the shadow of his wings</li>
  <li>He can at pleasure stint their melody:</li>
  <li>Even so mayst thou the giddy men of Rome.</li>
  <li>Then cheer thy spirit : for know, thou emperor,</li>
  <li>I will enchant the old Andronicus</li>
  <li class="number">With words more sweet, and yet more dangerous,</li>
  <li>Than baits to fish, or honey-stalks to sheep,</li>
  <li>When as the one is wounded with the bait,</li>

  <li class="speaker">Second Goth</li>

  <li>The crying babe controll'd with this discourse:</li>
  <li>'Peace, tawny slave, half me and half thy dam!</li>

  <li class="number">Well, let my deeds be witness of my worth.</li>
  <li>I train'd thy brethren to that guileful hole</li>

  <li class="number">Confederate with the queen and her two sons:</li>
  <li>And what not done, that thou hast cause to rue,</li>

  <li>I play'd the cheater for thy father's hand,</li>
  <li>And, when I had it, drew myself apart</li>

  <li>I pry'd me through the crevice of a wall</li>
  <li>When, for his hand, he had his two sons' heads;</li>
  <li>Beheld his tears, and laugh'd so heartily,</li>
  <li>That both mine eyes were rainy like to his :</li>

  <li>Welcome, ye warlike Goths; welcome, Lucius;</li>
  <li>And welcome, all: although the cheer be poor,</li>
  <li>'Twill fill your stomachs; please you eat of it.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SATURNINUS</li>
  <li class="number">Why art thou thus attired, Andronicus?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TITUS ANDRONICUS</li>
  <li>Because I would be sure to have all well,</li>
  <li>To entertain your highness and your empress.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TAMORA</li>
  <li>We are beholding to you, good Andronicus.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TITUS ANDRONICUS</li>
  <li>An if your highness knew my heart, you were.</li>
  <li class="number">My lord the emperor, resolve me this:</li>
  <li>Was it well done of rash Virginius</li>
  <li>To slay his daughter with his own right hand,</li>
  <li>Because she was enforced, stain'd, and deflower'd?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SATURNINUS</li>
  <li>It was, Andronicus.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TITUS ANDRONICUS</li>
  <li class="number">Your reason, mighty lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SATURNINUS</li>
  <li>Because the girl should not survive her shame,</li>
  <li>And by her presence still renew his sorrows.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TITUS ANDRONICUS</li>
  <li>A reason mighty, strong, and effectual;</li>
  <li>A pattern, precedent, and lively warrant,</li>
  <li class="number">For me, most wretched, to perform the like.</li>
  <li>Die, die, Lavinia, and thy shame with thee;</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Kills LAVINIA</li>
  <li>And, with thy shame, thy father's sorrow die!</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TITUS ANDRONICUS</li>
  <li>Kill'd her, for whom my tears have made me blind.</li>
  <li class="number">I am as woful as Virginius was,</li>
  <li>And have a thousand times more cause than he</li>
  <li>To do this outrage: and it now is done.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SATURNINUS</li>
  <li>What, was she ravish'd? tell who did the deed.</li>

  <li class="speaker">TAMORA</li>
  <li>Why hast thou slain thine only daughter thus?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TITUS ANDRONICUS</li>
  <li>Not I; 'twas Chiron and Demetrius:</li>
  <li>They ravish'd her, and cut away her tongue;</li>
  <li>And they, 'twas they, that did her all this wrong.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">

  <li class="speaker">MARCUS ANDRONICUS</li>
  <li>You sad-faced men, people and sons of Rome,</li>
  <li>By uproar sever'd, like a flight of fowl</li>
  <li class="number">Scatter'd by winds and high tempestuous gusts,</li>
  <li>O, let me teach you how to knit again</li>
  <li>This scatter'd corn into one mutual sheaf,</li>
  <li>These broken limbs again into one body;</li>
  <li>Lest Rome herself be bane unto herself,</li>
  <li class="number">And she whom mighty kingdoms court'sy to,</li>
  <li>Like a forlorn and desperate castaway,</li>
  <li>Do shameful execution on herself.</li>
  <li>But if my frosty signs and chaps of age,</li>
  <li>Grave witnesses of true experience,</li>
  <li class="number">Cannot induce you to attend my words,</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">To LUCIUS</li>
  <li>Speak, Rome's dear friend, as erst our ancestor,</li>
  <li>When with his solemn tongue he did discourse</li>
  <li>To love-sick Dido's sad attending ear</li>
  <li>The story of that baleful burning night</li>
  <li class="number">When subtle Greeks surprised King Priam's Troy,</li>
  <li>Tell us what Sinon hath bewitch'd our ears,</li>
  <li>Or who hath brought the fatal engine in</li>
  <li>That gives our Troy, our Rome, the civil wound.</li>
  <li>My heart is not compact of flint nor steel;</li>
  <li class="number">Nor can I utter all our bitter grief,</li>
  <li>But floods of tears will drown my oratory,</li>
  <li>And break my utterance, even in the time</li>
  <li>When it should move you to attend me most,</li>
  <li>Lending your kind commiseration.</li>
  <li class="number">Here is a captain, let him tell the tale;</li>
  <li>Your hearts will throb and weep to hear him speak.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LUCIUS</li>
  <li>Then, noble auditory, be it known to you,</li>
  <li>That cursed Chiron and Demetrius</li>
  <li>Were they that murdered our emperor's brother;</li>
  <li class="number">And they it were that ravished our sister:</li>
  <li>For their fell faults our brothers were beheaded;</li>
  <li>Our father's tears despised, and basely cozen'd</li>
  <li>Of that true hand that fought Rome's quarrel out,</li>
  <li>And sent her enemies unto the grave.</li>
  <li class="number">Lastly, myself unkindly banished,</li>
  <li>The gates shut on me, and turn'd weeping out,</li>
  <li>To beg relief among Rome's enemies:</li>
  <li>Who drown'd their enmity in my true tears.</li>
  <li>And oped their arms to embrace me as a friend.</li>
  <li class="number">I am the turned forth, be it known to you,</li>
  <li>That have preserved her welfare in my blood;</li>
  <li>And from her bosom took the enemy's point,</li>
  <li>Sheathing the steel in my adventurous body.</li>
  <li>Alas, you know I am no vaunter, I;</li>
  <li class="number">My scars can witness, dumb although they are,</li>
  <li>That my report is just and full of truth.</li>
  <li>But, soft! methinks I do digress too much,</li>
  <li>Citing my worthless praise: O, pardon me;</li>
  <li>For when no friends are by, men praise themselves.</li>

  <li class="speaker">MARCUS ANDRONICUS</li>
  <li class="number">Now is my turn to speak. Behold this child:</li>

  <li>Of this was Tamora delivered;</li>
  <li>The issue of an irreligious Moor,</li>
  <li>Chief architect and plotter of these woes:</li>
  <li>The villain is alive in Titus' house,</li>
  <li class="number">And as he is, to witness this is true.</li>
  <li>Now judge what cause had Titus to revenge</li>
  <li>These wrongs, unspeakable, past patience,</li>
  <li>Or more than any living man could bear.</li>
  <li>Now you have heard the truth, what say you, Romans?</li>
  <li class="number">Have we done aught amiss â€”  show us wherein,</li>
  <li>And, from the place where you behold us now,</li>
  <li>The poor remainder of Andronici</li>
  <li>Will, hand in hand, all headlong cast us down.</li>
  <li>And on the ragged stones beat forth our brains,</li>
  <li class="number">And make a mutual closure of our house.</li>
  <li>Speak, Romans, speak; and if you say we shall,</li>
  <li>Lo, hand in hand, Lucius and I will fall.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">AEMILIUS</li>
  <li>Come, come, thou reverend man of Rome,</li>

  <li>The common voice do cry it shall be so.</li>

  <li>Thanks, gentle Romans: may I govern so,</li>

  <li>For nature puts me to a heavy task:</li>
  <li>Stand all aloof: but, uncle, draw you near,</li>
  <li>To shed obsequious tears upon this trunk.</li>
  <li>O, take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips,</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Kissing TITUS</li>
  <li class="number">These sorrowful drops upon thy blood-stain'd face,</li>
  <li>The last true duties of thy noble son!</li>

  <li class="speaker">MARCUS ANDRONICUS</li>
  <li>Tear for tear, and loving kiss for kiss,</li>
  <li>Thy brother Marcus tenders on thy lips:</li>
  <li>O were the sum of these that I should pay</li>
  <li class="number">Countless and infinite, yet would I pay them!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LUCIUS</li>
  <li>Come hither, boy; come, come, and learn of us</li>
  <li>To melt in showers: thy grandsire loved thee well:</li>
  <li>Many a time he danced thee on his knee,</li>
  <li>Sung thee asleep, his loving breast thy pillow:</li>
  <li class="number">Many a matter hath he told to thee,</li>
  <li>Meet and agreeing with thine infancy;</li>
  <li>In that respect, then, like a loving child,</li>
  <li>Shed yet some small drops from thy tender spring,</li>
  <li>Because kind nature doth require it so:</li>
  <li class="number">Friends should associate friends in grief and woe:</li>
  <li>Bid him farewell; commit him to the grave;</li>
  <li>Do him that kindness, and take leave of him.</li>

  <li>You sad Andronici, have done with woes:</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LUCIUS</li>

  <li>See justice done on Aaron, that damn'd Moor,</li>
