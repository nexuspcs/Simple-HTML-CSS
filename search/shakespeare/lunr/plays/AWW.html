<h3>SCENE I.  Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter BERTRAM, the COUNTESS of Rousillon, HELENA,
and LAFEU, all in black</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">COUNTESS</li>
  <li>In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BERTRAM</li>
  <li>And I in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death</li>
  <li>anew: but I must attend his majesty's command, to</li>
  <li>whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LAFEU</li>
  <li class="number">You shall find of the king a husband, madam; you,</li>
  <li>sir, a father: he that so generally is at all times</li>
  <li>good must of necessity hold his virtue to you; whose</li>
  <li>worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather</li>
  <li>than lack it where there is such abundance.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">COUNTESS</li>
  <li class="number">What hope is there of his majesty's amendment?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LAFEU</li>
  <li>He hath abandoned his physicians, madam; under whose</li>
  <li>practises he hath persecuted time with hope, and</li>
  <li>finds no other advantage in the process but only the</li>
  <li>losing of hope by time.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">COUNTESS</li>
  <li class="number">This young gentlewoman had a father —  O, that</li>
  <li>'had'! how sad a passage 'tis! — whose skill was</li>
  <li>almost as great as his honesty; had it stretched so</li>
  <li>far, would have made nature immortal, and death</li>
  <li>should have play for lack of work. Would, for the</li>
  <li class="number">king's sake, he were living! I think it would be</li>
  <li>the death of the king's disease.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LAFEU</li>
  <li>How called you the man you speak of, madam?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">COUNTESS</li>
  <li>He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was</li>
  <li>his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LAFEU</li>
  <li class="number">He was excellent indeed, madam: the king very</li>
  <li>lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly: he</li>
  <li>was skilful enough to have lived still, if knowledge</li>
  <li>could be set up against mortality.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BERTRAM</li>
  <li>What is it, my good lord, the king languishes of?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LAFEU</li>
  <li class="number">A fistula, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BERTRAM</li>
  <li>I heard not of it before.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LAFEU</li>
  <li>I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman</li>
  <li>the daughter of Gerard de Narbon?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">COUNTESS</li>
  <li>His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my</li>
  <li class="number">overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that</li>
  <li>her education promises; her dispositions she</li>
  <li>inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where</li>
  <li>an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there</li>
  <li>commendations go with pity; they are virtues and</li>
  <li class="number">traitors too; in her they are the better for their</li>
  <li>simpleness; she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LAFEU</li>
  <li>Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">COUNTESS</li>
  <li>'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise</li>
  <li>in. The remembrance of her father never approaches</li>
  <li class="number">her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all</li>
  <li>livelihood from her cheek. No more of this, Helena;</li>
  <li>go to, no more; lest it be rather thought you affect</li>
  <li>a sorrow than have it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HELENA</li>
  <li>I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LAFEU</li>
  <li class="number">Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead,</li>
  <li>excessive grief the enemy to the living.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">COUNTESS</li>
  <li>If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess</li>
  <li>makes it soon mortal.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BERTRAM</li>
  <li>Madam, I desire your holy wishes.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LAFEU</li>
  <li class="number">How understand we that?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">COUNTESS</li>
  <li>Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father</li>
  <li>In manners, as in shape! thy blood and virtue</li>
  <li>Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness</li>
  <li>Share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,</li>
  <li class="number">Do wrong to none: be able for thine enemy</li>
  <li>Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend</li>
  <li>Under thy own life's key: be cheque'd for silence,</li>
  <li>But never tax'd for speech. What heaven more will,</li>
  <li>That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down,</li>
  <li class="number">Fall on thy head! Farewell, my lord;</li>
  <li>'Tis an unseason'd courtier; good my lord,</li>
  <li>Advise him.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LAFEU</li>
  <li>He cannot want the best</li>
  <li>That shall attend his love.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">COUNTESS</li>
  <li class="number">Heaven bless him! Farewell, Bertram.</li>

  <li class="speaker">BERTRAM</li>
  <li>To HELENA  The best wishes that can be forged in</li>
  <li>your thoughts be servants to you! Be comfortable</li>
  <li>to my mother, your mistress, and make much of her.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HELENA</li>
  <li>O, were that all! I think not on my father;</li>
  <li>And these great tears grace his remembrance more</li>
  <li>Than those I shed for him. What was he like?</li>
  <li>I have forgot him: my imagination</li>
  <li class="number">Carries no favour in't but Bertram's.</li>
  <li>I am undone: there is no living, none,</li>
  <li>If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one</li>
  <li>That I should love a bright particular star</li>
  <li>And think to wed it, he is so above me:</li>
  <li class="number">In his bright radiance and collateral light</li>
  <li>Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.</li>
  <li>The ambition in my love thus plagues itself:</li>
  <li>The hind that would be mated by the lion</li>
  <li>Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though plague,</li>
  <li class="number">To see him every hour; to sit and draw</li>
  <li>His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,</li>
  <li>In our heart's table; heart too capable</li>
  <li>Of every line and trick of his sweet favour:</li>
  <li>But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy</li>
  <li class="number">Must sanctify his reliques. Who comes here?</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Enter PAROLLES</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Aside</li>
  <li>One that goes with him: I love him for his sake;</li>
  <li>And yet I know him a notorious liar,</li>
  <li>Think him a great way fool, solely a coward;</li>
  <li>Yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him,</li>
  <li class="number">That they take place, when virtue's steely bones</li>
  <li>Look bleak i' the cold wind: withal, full oft we see</li>
  <li>Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PAROLLES</li>
  <li>Save you, fair queen!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HELENA</li>
  <li>And you, monarch!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PAROLLES</li>
  <li class="number">No.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HELENA</li>
  <li>And no.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PAROLLES</li>
  <li>Are you meditating on virginity?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HELENA</li>
  <li>Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you: let me</li>
  <li>ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity; how</li>
  <li class="number">may we barricado it against him?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PAROLLES</li>
  <li>Keep him out.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HELENA</li>
  <li>But he assails; and our virginity, though valiant,</li>
  <li>in the defence yet is weak: unfold to us some</li>
  <li>warlike resistance.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PAROLLES</li>
  <li class="number">There is none: man, sitting down before you, will</li>
  <li>undermine you and blow you up.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HELENA</li>
  <li>Bless our poor virginity from underminers and</li>
  <li>blowers up! Is there no military policy, how</li>
  <li>virgins might blow up men?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PAROLLES</li>
  <li class="number">Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be</li>
  <li>blown up: marry, in blowing him down again, with</li>
  <li>the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It</li>
  <li>is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to</li>
  <li>preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational</li>
  <li class="number">increase and there was never virgin got till</li>
  <li>virginity was first lost. That you were made of is</li>
  <li>metal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost</li>
  <li>may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is</li>
  <li>ever lost: 'tis too cold a companion; away with 't!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HELENA</li>
  <li class="number">I will stand for 't a little, though therefore I die a virgin.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PAROLLES</li>
  <li>There's little can be said in 't; 'tis against the</li>
  <li>rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity,</li>
  <li>is to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible</li>
  <li>disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin:</li>
  <li class="number">virginity murders itself and should be buried in</li>
  <li>highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate</li>
  <li>offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites,</li>
  <li>much like a cheese; consumes itself to the very</li>
  <li>paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach.</li>
  <li class="number">Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of</li>
  <li>self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the</li>
  <li>canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but loose</li>
  <li>by't: out with 't! within ten year it will make</li>
  <li>itself ten, which is a goodly increase; and the</li>
  <li class="number">principal itself not much the worse: away with 't!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HELENA</li>
  <li>How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PAROLLES</li>
  <li>Let me see: marry, ill, to like him that ne'er it</li>
  <li>likes. 'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with</li>
  <li>lying; the longer kept, the less worth: off with 't</li>
  <li class="number">while 'tis vendible; answer the time of request.</li>
  <li>Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out</li>
  <li>of fashion: richly suited, but unsuitable: just</li>
  <li>like the brooch and the tooth-pick, which wear not</li>
  <li>now. Your date is better in your pie and your</li>
  <li class="number">porridge than in your cheek; and your virginity,</li>
  <li>your old virginity, is like one of our French</li>
  <li>withered pears, it looks ill, it eats drily; marry,</li>
  <li>'tis a withered pear; it was formerly better;</li>
  <li>marry, yet 'tis a withered pear: will you anything with it?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HELENA</li>
  <li class="number">Not my virginity yet</li>
  <li>There shall your master have a thousand loves,</li>
  <li>A mother and a mistress and a friend,</li>
  <li>A phoenix, captain and an enemy,</li>
  <li>A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,</li>
  <li class="number">A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;</li>
  <li>His humble ambition, proud humility,</li>
  <li>His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,</li>
  <li>His faith, his sweet disaster; with a world</li>
  <li>Of pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms,</li>
  <li class="number">That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he — </li>
  <li>I know not what he shall. God send him well!</li>
  <li>The court's a learning place, and he is one — </li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PAROLLES</li>
  <li>What one, i' faith?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HELENA</li>
  <li>That I wish well. 'Tis pity — </li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PAROLLES</li>
  <li class="number">What's pity?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HELENA</li>
  <li>That wishing well had not a body in't,</li>
  <li>Which might be felt; that we, the poorer born,</li>
  <li>Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,</li>
  <li>Might with effects of them follow our friends,</li>
  <li class="number">And show what we alone must think, which never</li>
  <li>Return us thanks.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HELENA</li>
  <li class="number">Monsieur Parolles, you were born under a charitable star.</li>

  <li>When he was predominant.</li>

  <li>When he was retrograde, I think, rather.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PAROLLES</li>
  <li>Why think you so?</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HELENA</li>
  <li>You go so much backward when you fight.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HELENA</li>
  <li>So is running away, when fear proposes the safety;</li>
  <li>but the composition that your valour and fear makes</li>
  <li>in you is a virtue of a good wing, and I like the wear well.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PAROLLES</li>
  <li>I am so full of businesses, I cannot answer thee</li>
  <li class="number">acutely. I will return perfect courtier; in the</li>
  <li>which, my instruction shall serve to naturalize</li>
  <li>thee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier's</li>
  <li>counsel and understand what advice shall thrust upon</li>
  <li>thee; else thou diest in thine unthankfulness, and</li>
  <li class="number">thine ignorance makes thee away: farewell. When</li>
  <li>thou hast leisure, say thy prayers; when thou hast</li>
  <li>none, remember thy friends; get thee a good husband,</li>

  <li>This his good melancholy oft began,</li>

<h3>SCENE III.  Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter COUNTESS, Steward, and Clown</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">COUNTESS</li>
  <li>I will now hear; what say you of this gentlewoman?</li>

  <li class="speaker">Steward</li>
  <li>Madam, the care I have had to even your content, I</li>
  <li>wish might be found in the calendar of my past</li>
  <li>endeavours; for then we wound our modesty and make</li>
  <li class="number">foul the clearness of our deservings, when of</li>
  <li>ourselves we publish them.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">COUNTESS</li>
  <li>What does this knave here? Get you gone, sirrah:</li>
  <li>the complaints I have heard of you I do not all</li>
  <li>believe: 'tis my slowness that I do not; for I know</li>
  <li class="number">you lack not folly to commit them, and have ability</li>
  <li>enough to make such knaveries yours.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Clown</li>
  <li>'Tis not unknown to you, madam, I am a poor fellow.</li>

  <li>Well, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Clown</li>
  <li>No, madam, 'tis not so well that I am poor, though</li>
  <li class="number">many of the rich are damned: but, if I may have</li>
  <li>your ladyship's good will to go to the world, Isbel</li>
  <li>the woman and I will do as we may.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">COUNTESS</li>
  <li>Wilt thou needs be a beggar?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Clown</li>
  <li>I do beg your good will in this case.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">COUNTESS</li>
  <li class="number">In what case?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Clown</li>
  <li>In Isbel's case and mine own. Service is no</li>
  <li>heritage: and I think I shall never have the</li>
  <li>blessing of God till I have issue o' my body; for</li>
  <li>they say barnes are blessings.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">COUNTESS</li>
  <li class="number">Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Clown</li>
  <li>My poor body, madam, requires it: I am driven on</li>
  <li>by the flesh; and he must needs go that the devil drives.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">COUNTESS</li>
  <li>Is this all your worship's reason?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Clown</li>
  <li>Faith, madam, I have other holy reasons such as they</li>
  <li class="number">are.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">COUNTESS</li>
  <li>May the world know them?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Clown</li>
  <li>I have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you and</li>
  <li>all flesh and blood are; and, indeed, I do marry</li>
  <li>that I may repent.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">COUNTESS</li>
  <li class="number">Thy marriage, sooner than thy wickedness.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Clown</li>
  <li>I am out o' friends, madam; and I hope to have</li>
  <li>friends for my wife's sake.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">COUNTESS</li>
  <li>Such friends are thine enemies, knave.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Clown</li>
  <li>You're shallow, madam, in great friends; for the</li>
  <li class="number">knaves come to do that for me which I am aweary of.</li>
  <li>He that ears my land spares my team and gives me</li>
  <li>leave to in the crop; if I be his cuckold, he's my</li>
  <li>drudge: he that comforts my wife is the cherisher</li>
  <li>of my flesh and blood; he that cherishes my flesh</li>
  <li class="number">and blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves my</li>
  <li>flesh and blood is my friend: ergo, he that kisses</li>
  <li>my wife is my friend. If men could be contented to</li>
  <li>be what they are, there were no fear in marriage;</li>
  <li>for young Charbon the Puritan and old Poysam the</li>
  <li class="number">Papist, howsome'er their hearts are severed in</li>
  <li>religion, their heads are both one; they may jowl</li>
  <li>horns together, like any deer i' the herd.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">COUNTESS</li>
  <li>Wilt thou ever be a foul-mouthed and calumnious knave?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Clown</li>
  <li>A prophet I, madam; and I speak the truth the next</li>
  <li class="number">way:</li>
  <li>For I the ballad will repeat,</li>
  <li>Which men full true shall find;</li>
  <li>Your marriage comes by destiny,</li>
  <li>Your cuckoo sings by kind.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">COUNTESS</li>

  <li class="speaker">Steward</li>
  <li>May it please you, madam, that he bid Helen come to</li>
  <li>you: of her I am to speak.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">COUNTESS</li>
  <li>Sirrah, tell my gentlewoman I would speak with her;</li>
  <li>Helen, I mean.</li>

  <li>Among nine bad if one be good,</li>
  <li>Among nine bad if one be good,</li>

  <li class="number">What, one good in ten? you corrupt the song, sirrah.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Clown</li>
  <li>One good woman in ten, madam; which is a purifying</li>
  <li>o' the song: would God would serve the world so all</li>
  <li>the year! we'ld find no fault with the tithe-woman,</li>
  <li>if I were the parson. One in ten, quoth a'! An we</li>
  <li class="number">might have a good woman born but one every blazing</li>
  <li>star, or at an earthquake, 'twould mend the lottery</li>
  <li>well: a man may draw his heart out, ere a' pluck</li>
  <li>one.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">COUNTESS</li>
  <li>You'll be gone, sir knave, and do as I command you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Clown</li>
  <li class="number">That man should be at woman's command, and yet no</li>
  <li>hurt done! Though honesty be no puritan, yet it</li>
  <li>will do no hurt; it will wear the surplice of</li>

  <li>I know, madam, you love your gentlewoman entirely.</li>

  <li>Faith, I do: her father bequeathed her to me; and</li>

  <li>make title to as much love as she finds: there is</li>
  <li class="number">more owing her than is paid; and more shall be paid</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Steward</li>
  <li>Madam, I was very late more near her than I think</li>
  <li>she wished me: alone she was, and did communicate</li>
  <li>to herself her own words to her own ears; she</li>
  <li class="number">thought, I dare vow for her, they touched not any</li>
  <li>stranger sense. Her matter was, she loved your son:</li>
  <li>Fortune, she said, was no goddess, that had put</li>
  <li>such difference betwixt their two estates; Love no</li>
  <li>god, that would not extend his might, only where</li>
  <li class="number">qualities were level; Dian no queen of virgins, that</li>
  <li>would suffer her poor knight surprised, without</li>
  <li>rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward.</li>
  <li>This she delivered in the most bitter touch of</li>
  <li>sorrow that e'er I heard virgin exclaim in: which I</li>
  <li class="number">held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal;</li>
  <li>sithence, in the loss that may happen, it concerns</li>
  <li>you something to know it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">COUNTESS</li>
  <li>You have discharged this honestly; keep it to</li>
  <li>yourself: many likelihoods informed me of this</li>
  <li class="number">before, which hung so tottering in the balance that</li>
  <li>I could neither believe nor misdoubt. Pray you,</li>
  <li>leave me: stall this in your bosom; and I thank you</li>

  <li class="stage-direction">Exit Steward</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Enter HELENA</li>
  <li>Even so it was with me when I was young:</li>
  <li class="number">If ever we are nature's, these are ours; this thorn</li>
  <li>Doth to our rose of youth rightly belong;</li>
  <li>Our blood to us, this to our blood is born;</li>
  <li>It is the show and seal of nature's truth,</li>

  <li class="number">By our remembrances of days foregone,</li>
  <li>Such were our faults, or then we thought them none.</li>
  <li>Her eye is sick on't: I observe her now.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HELENA</li>
  <li>What is your pleasure, madam?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">COUNTESS</li>
  <li>You know, Helen,</li>

  <li>Mine honourable mistress.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">COUNTESS</li>
  <li>Nay, a mother:</li>
  <li>Why not a mother? When I said 'a mother,'</li>
  <li>Methought you saw a serpent: what's in 'mother,'</li>
  <li class="number">That you start at it? I say, I am your mother;</li>
  <li>And put you in the catalogue of those</li>
  <li>That were enwombed mine: 'tis often seen</li>
  <li>Adoption strives with nature and choice breeds</li>
  <li>A native slip to us from foreign seeds:</li>
  <li class="number">You ne'er oppress'd me with a mother's groan,</li>
  <li>Yet I express to you a mother's care:</li>
  <li>God's mercy, maiden! does it curd thy blood</li>
  <li>To say I am thy mother? What's the matter,</li>
  <li>That this distemper'd messenger of wet,</li>
  <li class="number">The many-colour'd Iris, rounds thine eye?</li>
  <li>Why? that you are my daughter?</li>

  <li class="number">The Count Rousillon cannot be my brother:</li>

  <li>His servant live, and will his vassal die:</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HELENA</li>
  <li>You are my mother, madam; would you were —  </li>
  <li>So that my lord your son were not my brother —  </li>
  <li>Indeed my mother! or were you both our mothers,</li>
  <li class="number">I care no more for than I do for heaven,</li>
  <li>So I were not his sister. Can't no other,</li>

  <li class="speaker">COUNTESS</li>
  <li>Yes, Helen, you might be my daughter-in-law:</li>
  <li>God shield you mean it not! daughter and mother</li>
  <li class="number">So strive upon your pulse. What, pale again?</li>
  <li>My fear hath catch'd your fondness: now I see</li>
  <li>The mystery of your loneliness, and find</li>
  <li>Your salt tears' head: now to all sense 'tis gross</li>
  <li>You love my son; invention is ashamed,</li>
  <li class="number">Against the proclamation of thy passion,</li>
  <li>To say thou dost not: therefore tell me true;</li>
  <li>But tell me then, 'tis so; for, look thy cheeks</li>
  <li>Confess it, th' one to th' other; and thine eyes</li>
  <li>See it so grossly shown in thy behaviors</li>
  <li class="number">That in their kind they speak it: only sin</li>
  <li>And hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue,</li>
  <li>That truth should be suspected. Speak, is't so?</li>
  <li>If it be so, you have wound a goodly clew;</li>
  <li>If it be not, forswear't: howe'er, I charge thee,</li>
  <li class="number">As heaven shall work in me for thine avail,</li>
  <li>Tell me truly.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HELENA</li>
  <li>Good madam, pardon me!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">COUNTESS</li>
  <li>Do you love my son?</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HELENA</li>
  <li>Your pardon, noble mistress!</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">COUNTESS</li>
  <li class="number">Love you my son?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HELENA</li>
  <li>Do not you love him, madam?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">COUNTESS</li>
  <li>Go not about; my love hath in't a bond,</li>
  <li>Whereof the world takes note: come, come, disclose</li>
  <li>The state of your affection; for your passions</li>
  <li class="number">Have to the full appeach'd.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HELENA</li>
  <li>Then, I confess,</li>
  <li>Here on my knee, before high heaven and you,</li>
  <li>That before you, and next unto high heaven,</li>
  <li>I love your son.</li>
  <li class="number">My friends were poor, but honest; so's my love:</li>
  <li>Be not offended; for it hurts not him</li>
  <li>That he is loved of me: I follow him not</li>
  <li>By any token of presumptuous suit;</li>
  <li>Nor would I have him till I do deserve him;</li>
  <li class="number">Yet never know how that desert should be.</li>
  <li>I know I love in vain, strive against hope;</li>
  <li>Yet in this captious and intenible sieve</li>
  <li>I still pour in the waters of my love</li>
  <li>And lack not to lose still: thus, Indian-like,</li>
  <li class="number">Religious in mine error, I adore</li>
  <li>The sun, that looks upon his worshipper,</li>
  <li>But knows of him no more. My dearest madam,</li>
  <li>Let not your hate encounter with my love</li>
  <li>For loving where you do: but if yourself,</li>
  <li class="number">Whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth,</li>
  <li>Did ever in so true a flame of liking</li>
  <li>Wish chastely and love dearly, that your Dian</li>
  <li>Was both herself and love: O, then, give pity</li>
  <li>To her, whose state is such that cannot choose</li>
  <li class="number">But lend and give where she is sure to lose;</li>
  <li>That seeks not to find that her search implies,</li>
  <li>But riddle-like lives sweetly where she dies!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">COUNTESS</li>
  <li>Had you not lately an intent —  speak truly —  </li>
  <li>To go to Paris?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HELENA</li>
  <li class="number">Madam, I had.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">COUNTESS</li>
  <li>Wherefore? tell true.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HELENA</li>
  <li>I will tell truth; by grace itself I swear.</li>
  <li>You know my father left me some prescriptions</li>
  <li>Of rare and proved effects, such as his reading</li>
  <li class="number">And manifest experience had collected</li>
  <li>For general sovereignty; and that he will'd me</li>
  <li>In heedfull'st reservation to bestow them,</li>
  <li>As notes whose faculties inclusive were</li>
  <li>More than they were in note: amongst the rest,</li>
  <li class="number">There is a remedy, approved, set down,</li>
  <li>To cure the desperate languishings whereof</li>
  <li>The king is render'd lost.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">COUNTESS</li>
  <li>This was your motive</li>
  <li>For Paris, was it? speak.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HELENA</li>
  <li class="number">My lord your son made me to think of this;</li>
  <li>Else Paris and the medicine and the king</li>
  <li>Had from the conversation of my thoughts</li>
  <li>Haply been absent then.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">COUNTESS</li>
  <li>But think you, Helen,</li>
  <li class="number">If you should tender your supposed aid,</li>
  <li>He would receive it? he and his physicians</li>
  <li>Are of a mind; he, that they cannot help him,</li>
  <li>They, that they cannot help: how shall they credit</li>
  <li>A poor unlearned virgin, when the schools,</li>
  <li class="number">Embowell'd of their doctrine, have left off</li>
  <li>The danger to itself?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HELENA</li>
  <li>There's something in't,</li>
  <li>More than my father's skill, which was the greatest</li>
  <li>Of his profession, that his good receipt</li>
  <li class="number">Shall for my legacy be sanctified</li>
  <li>By the luckiest stars in heaven: and, would your honour</li>
  <li>But give me leave to try success, I'ld venture</li>
  <li>The well-lost life of mine on his grace's cure</li>
  <li>By such a day and hour.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">COUNTESS</li>
  <li class="number">Dost thou believe't?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HELENA</li>
  <li>Ay, madam, knowingly.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">COUNTESS</li>
  <li>Why, Helen, thou shalt have my leave and love,</li>
  <li>Means and attendants and my loving greetings</li>
  <li>To those of mine in court: I'll stay at home</li>
  <li class="number">And pray God's blessing into thy attempt:</li>

  <li>Ay, my good lord.</li>
  <li>Gerard de Narbon was my father;</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HELENA</li>
  <li>The rather will I spare my praises towards him:</li>
  <li>Knowing him is enough. On's bed of death</li>
  <li>Many receipts he gave me: chiefly one.</li>
  <li>Which, as the dearest issue of his practise,</li>
  <li class="number">And of his old experience the oily darling,</li>
  <li>He bade me store up, as a triple eye,</li>
  <li>Safer than mine own two, more dear; I have so;</li>
  <li>And hearing your high majesty is touch'd</li>
  <li>With that malignant cause wherein the honour</li>
  <li class="number">Of my dear father's gift stands chief in power,</li>
  <li>I come to tender it and my appliance</li>
  <li>With all bound humbleness.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING</li>
  <li>We thank you, maiden;</li>

  <li class="number">When our most learned doctors leave us and</li>

  <li>So stain our judgment, or corrupt our hope,</li>

  <li class="speaker">HELENA</li>
  <li>My duty then shall pay me for my pains:</li>

  <li class="speaker">KING</li>
  <li>I cannot give thee less, to be call'd grateful:</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HELENA</li>
  <li>What I can do can do no hurt to try,</li>
  <li>Since you set up your rest 'gainst remedy.</li>
  <li class="number">He that of greatest works is finisher</li>
  <li>Oft does them by the weakest minister:</li>
  <li>So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown,</li>
  <li>When judges have been babes; great floods have flown</li>
  <li>From simple sources, and great seas have dried</li>
  <li class="number">When miracles have by the greatest been denied.</li>
  <li>Oft expectation fails and most oft there</li>
  <li>Where most it promises, and oft it hits</li>
  <li>Where hope is coldest and despair most fits.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING</li>
  <li>I must not hear thee; fare thee well, kind maid;</li>

  <li>Truly, madam, if God have lent a man any manners, he</li>

  <li>The place is dignified by the doer's deed:</li>
  <li>Where great additions swell's, and virtue none,</li>
  <li>It is a dropsied honour. Good alone</li>

  <li>The property by what it is should go,</li>
  <li>Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair;</li>
  <li>In these to nature she's immediate heir,</li>
  <li>And these breed honour: that is honour's scorn,</li>
  <li class="number">Which challenges itself as honour's born</li>
  <li>And is not like the sire: honours thrive,</li>
  <li>When rather from our acts we them derive</li>
  <li>Than our foregoers: the mere word's a slave</li>
  <li>Debosh'd on every tomb, on every grave</li>
  <li class="number">A lying trophy, and as oft is dumb</li>
  <li>Where dust and damn'd oblivion is the tomb</li>
  <li>Of honour'd bones indeed. What should be said?</li>
  <li>If thou canst like this creature as a maid,</li>
  <li>I can create the rest: virtue and she</li>

<h3>SCENE V.  Florence. Without the walls. A tucket afar off.</h3>

  <li class="speaker">DIANA</li>
  <li>They say the French count has done most honourable service.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Widow</li>

  <li>Come, let's return again, and suffice ourselves with</li>
  <li class="number">the report of it. Well, Diana, take heed of this</li>

  <li>no legacy is so rich as honesty.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Widow</li>
  <li>I have told my neighbour how you have been solicited</li>

  <li class="number">I know that knave; hang him! one Parolles: a</li>

  <li>young earl. Beware of them, Diana; their promises,</li>
  <li>enticements, oaths, tokens, and all these engines of</li>
  <li>lust, are not the things they go under: many a maid</li>
  <li class="number">hath been seduced by them; and the misery is,</li>
  <li>example, that so terrible shows in the wreck of</li>
  <li>maidenhood, cannot for all that dissuade succession,</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DIANA</li>
  <li class="number">Whatsome'er he is,</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HELENA</li>
  <li>Ay, surely, mere the truth: I know his lady.</li>

  <li class="speaker">HELENA</li>
  <li>O, I believe with him,</li>
  <li class="number">In argument of praise, or to the worth</li>
  <li>Of the great count himself, she is too mean</li>
  <li>To have her name repeated: all her deserving</li>

  <li>I have not heard examined.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DIANA</li>
  <li class="number">Alas, poor lady!</li>
  <li>'Tis a hard bondage to become the wife</li>

  <li class="speaker">Widow</li>
  <li>I warrant, good creature, wheresoe'er she is,</li>

  <li>How do you mean?</li>

  <li>Believe it, my lord, in mine own direct knowledge,</li>

  <li>It is to be recovered: but that the merit of</li>

  <li>instrument of honour again into his native quarter,</li>
  <li>be magnanimous in the enterprise and go on; I will</li>
  <li>grace the attempt for a worthy exploit: if you</li>

  <li class="number">one be a man of his own fancy, not to know what we</li>

<h3>SCENE III.  The Florentine camp.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter the two French Lords and some two or three Soldiers</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Lord</li>
  <li>You have not given him his mother's letter?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Lord</li>
  <li>I have delivered it an hour since: there is</li>
  <li>something in't that stings his nature; for on the</li>
  <li>reading it he changed almost into another man.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Lord</li>
  <li class="number">He has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking</li>
  <li>off so good a wife and so sweet a lady.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Lord</li>
  <li>Especially he hath incurred the everlasting</li>
  <li>displeasure of the king, who had even tuned his</li>
  <li>bounty to sing happiness to him. I will tell you a</li>
  <li class="number">thing, but you shall let it dwell darkly with you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Lord</li>
  <li>When you have spoken it, 'tis dead, and I am the</li>
  <li>grave of it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Lord</li>
  <li>He hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in</li>
  <li>Florence, of a most chaste renown; and this night he</li>
  <li class="number">fleshes his will in the spoil of her honour: he hath</li>
  <li>given her his monumental ring, and thinks himself</li>
  <li>made in the unchaste composition.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Lord</li>
  <li>Now, God delay our rebellion! as we are ourselves,</li>
  <li>what things are we!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Lord</li>
  <li class="number">Merely our own traitors. And as in the common course</li>
  <li>of all treasons, we still see them reveal</li>
  <li>themselves, till they attain to their abhorred ends,</li>
  <li>so he that in this action contrives against his own</li>
  <li>nobility, in his proper stream o'erflows himself.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Lord</li>
  <li class="number">Is it not meant damnable in us, to be trumpeters of</li>
  <li>our unlawful intents? We shall not then have his</li>
  <li>company to-night?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Lord</li>
  <li>Not till after midnight; for he is dieted to his hour.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Lord</li>
  <li>That approaches apace; I would gladly have him see</li>
  <li class="number">his company anatomized, that he might take a measure</li>
  <li>of his own judgments, wherein so curiously he had</li>
  <li>set this counterfeit.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Lord</li>
  <li>We will not meddle with him till he come; for his</li>
  <li>presence must be the whip of the other.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Lord</li>
  <li class="number">In the mean time, what hear you of these wars?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Lord</li>
  <li>I hear there is an overture of peace.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Lord</li>
  <li>Nay, I assure you, a peace concluded.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Lord</li>
  <li>What will Count Rousillon do then? will he travel</li>
  <li>higher, or return again into France?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Lord</li>
  <li class="number">I perceive, by this demand, you are not altogether</li>
  <li>of his council.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Lord</li>
  <li>Let it be forbid, sir; so should I be a great deal</li>
  <li>of his act.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Lord</li>
  <li>Sir, his wife some two months since fled from his</li>
  <li class="number">house: her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques</li>
  <li>le Grand; which holy undertaking with most austere</li>
  <li>sanctimony she accomplished; and, there residing the</li>
  <li>tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her</li>
  <li>grief; in fine, made a groan of her last breath, and</li>
  <li class="number">now she sings in heaven.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Lord</li>
  <li>How is this justified?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Lord</li>
  <li>The stronger part of it by her own letters, which</li>
  <li>makes her story true, even to the point of her</li>
  <li>death: her death itself, which could not be her</li>
  <li class="number">office to say is come, was faithfully confirmed by</li>
  <li>the rector of the place.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Lord</li>
  <li>Hath the count all this intelligence?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Lord</li>
  <li>Ay, and the particular confirmations, point from</li>
  <li>point, so to the full arming of the verity.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Lord</li>
  <li class="number">I am heartily sorry that he'll be glad of this.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Lord</li>
  <li>How mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Lord</li>
  <li>And how mightily some other times we drown our gain</li>
  <li>in tears! The great dignity that his valour hath</li>
  <li>here acquired for him shall at home be encountered</li>
  <li class="number">with a shame as ample.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Lord</li>
  <li>The web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and</li>
  <li>ill together: our virtues would be proud, if our</li>
  <li>faults whipped them not; and our crimes would</li>
  <li>despair, if they were not cherished by our virtues.</li>

  <li class="speaker">Servant</li>
  <li>He met the duke in the street, sir, of whom he hath</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BERTRAM</li>
  <li class="number">I have to-night dispatched sixteen businesses, a</li>
  <li>month's length a-piece, by an abstract of success:</li>
  <li>I have congied with the duke, done my adieu with his</li>
  <li>nearest; buried a wife, mourned for her; writ to my</li>
  <li>lady mother I am returning; entertained my convoy;</li>
  <li class="number">and between these main parcels of dispatch effected</li>
  <li>many nicer needs; the last was the greatest, but</li>
  <li>that I have not ended yet.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Lord</li>
  <li>If the business be of any difficulty, and this</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BERTRAM</li>
  <li>I mean, the business is not ended, as fearing to</li>

  <li>bring forth this counterfeit module, he has deceived</li>
  <li class="number">me, like a double-meaning prophesier.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Lord</li>

  <li>No matter: his heels have deserved it, in usurping</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Lord</li>
  <li class="number">I have told your lordship already, the stocks carry</li>
  <li>him. But to answer you as you would be understood;</li>
  <li>he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk: he</li>
  <li>hath confessed himself to Morgan, whom he supposes</li>
  <li>to be a friar, from the time of his remembrance to</li>
  <li class="number">this very instant disaster of his setting i' the</li>
  <li>stocks: and what think you he hath confessed?</li>

  <li class="speaker">BERTRAM</li>
  <li>Nothing of me, has a'?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Lord</li>
  <li>His confession is taken, and it shall be read to his</li>

  <li class="speaker">PAROLLES</li>

  <li>You're deceived, my lord: this is Monsieur</li>

  <li>Five or six thousand horse, I said —   I will say</li>

  <li>Poor rogues, I pray you, say.</li>

  <li>Well, that's set down.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PAROLLES</li>

  <li>By my troth, sir, if I were to live this present</li>

  <li class="number">many; Jaques, so many; Guiltian, Cosmo, Lodowick,</li>
  <li>and Gratii, two hundred and fifty each; mine own</li>
  <li>company, Chitopher, Vaumond, Bentii, two hundred and</li>
  <li>fifty each: so that the muster-file, rotten and</li>
  <li>sound, upon my life, amounts not to fifteen thousand</li>
  <li class="number">poll; half of the which dare not shake snow from off</li>
  <li>their cassocks, lest they shake themselves to pieces.</li>

  <li>What shall be done to him?</li>

<ol class="speech">

<ol class="speech">

  <li>I know him: a' was a botcher's 'prentice in Paris,</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PAROLLES</li>
  <li>That is not the duke's letter, sir; that is an</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Soldier</li>
  <li>Nay, I'll read it first, by your favour.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PAROLLES</li>
  <li class="number">My meaning in't, I protest, was very honest in the</li>

  <li class="speaker">PAROLLES</li>
  <li>My life, sir, in any case: not that I am afraid to</li>

  <li class="speaker">First Soldier</li>
  <li>We'll see what may be done, so you confess freely;</li>
  <li>therefore, once more to this Captain Dumain: you</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PAROLLES</li>
  <li>He will steal, sir, an egg out of a cloister: for</li>

  <li>is stronger than Hercules: he will lie, sir, with</li>
  <li class="number">such volubility, that you would think truth were a</li>
  <li>fool: drunkenness is his best virtue, for he will</li>
  <li>be swine-drunk; and in his sleep he does little</li>
  <li>harm, save to his bed-clothes about him; but they</li>
  <li>know his conditions and lay him in straw. I have but</li>
  <li class="number">little more to say, sir, of his honesty: he has</li>

  <li>an honest man should have, he has nothing.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PAROLLES</li>
  <li>Faith, sir, he has led the drum before the English</li>

  <li class="number">he had the honour to be the officer at a place there</li>

  <li class="speaker">PAROLLES</li>
  <li>Yes, so please your majesty. I did go between them,</li>
  <li>as I said; but more than that, he loved her: for</li>
  <li>indeed he was mad for her, and talked of Satan and</li>
  <li class="number">of Limbo and of Furies and I know not what: yet I</li>
  <li>was in that credit with them at that time that I</li>
  <li>knew of their going to bed, and of other motions,</li>
  <li>as promising her marriage, and things which would</li>
  <li>derive me ill will to speak of; therefore I will not</li>

  <li class="speaker">KING</li>
  <li>Thou hast spoken all already, unless thou canst say</li>

  <li>Great king, I am no strumpet, by my life;</li>
