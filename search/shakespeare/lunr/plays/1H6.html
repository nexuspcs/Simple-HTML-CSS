<h3>SCENE I.  Westminster Abbey.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Dead March. Enter the Funeral of KING HENRY the
Fifth, attended on by Dukes of BEDFORD, Regent of
France; GLOUCESTER, Protector; and EXETER, Earl of
WARWICK, the BISHOP OF WINCHESTER, Heralds, etc.</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BEDFORD</li>
  <li>Hung be the heavens with black, yield day to night!</li>
  <li>Comets, importing change of times and states,</li>
  <li>Brandish your crystal tresses in the sky,</li>
  <li>And with them scourge the bad revolting stars</li>
  <li class="number">That have consented unto Henry's death!</li>
  <li>King Henry the Fifth, too famous to live long!</li>
  <li>England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>England ne'er had a king until his time.</li>
  <li>Virtue he had, deserving to command:</li>
  <li class="number">His brandish'd sword did blind men with his beams:</li>
  <li>His arms spread wider than a dragon's wings;</li>
  <li>His sparking eyes, replete with wrathful fire,</li>
  <li>More dazzled and drove back his enemies</li>
  <li>Than mid-day sun fierce bent against their faces.</li>
  <li class="number">What should I say? his deeds exceed all speech:</li>
  <li>He ne'er lift up his hand but conquered.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EXETER</li>
  <li>We mourn in black: why mourn we not in blood?</li>
  <li>Henry is dead and never shall revive:</li>
  <li>Upon a wooden coffin we attend,</li>
  <li class="number">And death's dishonourable victory</li>
  <li>We with our stately presence glorify,</li>
  <li>Like captives bound to a triumphant car.</li>
  <li>What! shall we curse the planets of mishap</li>
  <li>That plotted thus our glory's overthrow?</li>
  <li class="number">Or shall we think the subtle-witted French</li>
  <li>Conjurers and sorcerers, that afraid of him</li>
  <li>By magic verses have contrived his end?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BISHOP OF WINCHESTER</li>
  <li>He was a king bless'd of the King of kings.</li>
  <li>Unto the French the dreadful judgement-day</li>
  <li class="number">So dreadful will not be as was his sight.</li>
  <li>The battles of the Lord of hosts he fought:</li>
  <li>The church's prayers made him so prosperous.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>The church! where is it? Had not churchmen pray'd,</li>
  <li>His thread of life had not so soon decay'd:</li>
  <li class="number">None do you like but an effeminate prince,</li>
  <li>Whom, like a school-boy, you may over-awe.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BISHOP OF WINCHESTER</li>
  <li>Gloucester, whate'er we like, thou art protector</li>
  <li>And lookest to command the prince and realm.</li>
  <li>Thy wife is proud; she holdeth thee in awe,</li>
  <li class="number">More than God or religious churchmen may.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>Name not religion, for thou lovest the flesh,</li>
  <li>And ne'er throughout the year to church thou go'st</li>
  <li>Except it be to pray against thy foes.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BEDFORD</li>
  <li>Cease, cease these jars and rest your minds in peace:</li>
  <li class="number">Let's to the altar: heralds, wait on us:</li>
  <li>Instead of gold, we'll offer up our arms:</li>
  <li>Since arms avail not now that Henry's dead.</li>
  <li>Posterity, await for wretched years,</li>
  <li>When at their mothers' moist eyes babes shall suck,</li>
  <li class="number">Our isle be made a nourish of salt tears,</li>
  <li>And none but women left to wail the dead.</li>
  <li>Henry the Fifth, thy ghost I invocate:</li>
  <li>Prosper this realm, keep it from civil broils,</li>
  <li>Combat with adverse planets in the heavens!</li>
  <li class="number">A far more glorious star thy soul will make</li>
  <li>Than Julius Caesar or bright — </li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter a Messenger</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Messenger</li>
  <li>My honourable lords, health to you all!</li>
  <li>Sad tidings bring I to you out of France,</li>
  <li>Of loss, of slaughter and discomfiture:</li>
  <li class="number">Guienne, Champagne, Rheims, Orleans,</li>
  <li>Paris, Guysors, Poictiers, are all quite lost.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BEDFORD</li>
  <li>What say'st thou, man, before dead Henry's corse?</li>
  <li>Speak softly, or the loss of those great towns</li>
  <li>Will make him burst his lead and rise from death.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li class="number">Is Paris lost? is Rouen yielded up?</li>
  <li>If Henry were recall'd to life again,</li>
  <li>These news would cause him once more yield the ghost.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EXETER</li>
  <li>How were they lost? what treachery was used?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Messenger</li>
  <li>No treachery; but want of men and money.</li>
  <li class="number">Amongst the soldiers this is muttered,</li>
  <li>That here you maintain several factions,</li>
  <li>And whilst a field should be dispatch'd and fought,</li>
  <li>You are disputing of your generals:</li>
  <li>One would have lingering wars with little cost;</li>
  <li class="number">Another would fly swift, but wanteth wings;</li>
  <li>A third thinks, without expense at all,</li>
  <li>By guileful fair words peace may be obtain'd.</li>
  <li>Awake, awake, English nobility!</li>
  <li>Let not sloth dim your horrors new-begot:</li>
  <li class="number">Cropp'd are the flower-de-luces in your arms;</li>
  <li>Of England's coat one half is cut away.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EXETER</li>
  <li>Were our tears wanting to this funeral,</li>
  <li>These tidings would call forth their flowing tides.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BEDFORD</li>
  <li>Me they concern; Regent I am of France.</li>
  <li class="number">Give me my steeled coat. I'll fight for France.</li>
  <li>Away with these disgraceful wailing robes!</li>
  <li>Wounds will I lend the French instead of eyes,</li>
  <li>To weep their intermissive miseries.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter to them another Messenger</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Messenger</li>
  <li>Lords, view these letters full of bad mischance.</li>
  <li class="number">France is revolted from the English quite,</li>
  <li>Except some petty towns of no import:</li>
  <li>The Dauphin Charles is crowned king of Rheims;</li>
  <li>The Bastard of Orleans with him is join'd;</li>
  <li>Reignier, Duke of Anjou, doth take his part;</li>
  <li class="number">The Duke of Alencon flieth to his side.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EXETER</li>
  <li>The Dauphin crowned king! all fly to him!</li>
  <li>O, whither shall we fly from this reproach?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>We will not fly, but to our enemies' throats.</li>
  <li>Bedford, if thou be slack, I'll fight it out.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BEDFORD</li>
  <li class="number">Gloucester, why doubt'st thou of my forwardness?</li>
  <li>An army have I muster'd in my thoughts,</li>
  <li>Wherewith already France is overrun.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter another Messenger</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Messenger</li>
  <li>My gracious lords, to add to your laments,</li>
  <li>Wherewith you now bedew King Henry's hearse,</li>
  <li class="number">I must inform you of a dismal fight</li>
  <li>Betwixt the stout Lord Talbot and the French.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BISHOP OF WINCHESTER</li>
  <li>What! wherein Talbot overcame? is't so?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Messenger</li>
  <li>O, no; wherein Lord Talbot was o'erthrown:</li>
  <li>The circumstance I'll tell you more at large.</li>
  <li class="number">The tenth of August last this dreadful lord,</li>
  <li>Retiring from the siege of Orleans,</li>
  <li>Having full scarce six thousand in his troop.</li>
  <li>By three and twenty thousand of the French</li>
  <li>Was round encompassed and set upon.</li>
  <li class="number">No leisure had he to enrank his men;</li>
  <li>He wanted pikes to set before his archers;</li>
  <li>Instead whereof sharp stakes pluck'd out of hedges</li>
  <li>They pitched in the ground confusedly,</li>
  <li>To keep the horsemen off from breaking in.</li>
  <li class="number">More than three hours the fight continued;</li>
  <li>Where valiant Talbot above human thought</li>
  <li>Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:</li>
  <li>Hundreds he sent to hell, and none durst stand him;</li>
  <li>Here, there, and every where, enraged he flew:</li>
  <li class="number">The French exclaim'd, the devil was in arms;</li>
  <li>All the whole army stood agazed on him:</li>
  <li>His soldiers spying his undaunted spirit</li>
  <li>A Talbot! a Talbot! cried out amain</li>
  <li>And rush'd into the bowels of the battle.</li>
  <li class="number">Here had the conquest fully been seal'd up,</li>
  <li>If Sir John Fastolfe had not play'd the coward:</li>
  <li>He, being in the vaward, placed behind</li>
  <li>With purpose to relieve and follow them,</li>
  <li>Cowardly fled, not having struck one stroke.</li>
  <li class="number">Hence grew the general wreck and massacre;</li>
  <li>Enclosed were they with their enemies:</li>
  <li>A base Walloon, to win the Dauphin's grace,</li>
  <li>Thrust Talbot with a spear into the back,</li>
  <li>Whom all France with their chief assembled strength</li>
  <li class="number">Durst not presume to look once in the face.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BEDFORD</li>
  <li>Is Talbot slain? then I will slay myself,</li>
  <li>For living idly here in pomp and ease,</li>
  <li>Whilst such a worthy leader, wanting aid,</li>
  <li>Unto his dastard foemen is betray'd.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Messenger</li>
  <li class="number">O no, he lives; but is took prisoner,</li>
  <li>And Lord Scales with him and Lord Hungerford:</li>
  <li>Most of the rest slaughter'd or took likewise.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BEDFORD</li>
  <li>His ransom there is none but I shall pay:</li>
  <li>I'll hale the Dauphin headlong from his throne:</li>
  <li class="number">His crown shall be the ransom of my friend;</li>
  <li>Four of their lords I'll change for one of ours.</li>
  <li>Farewell, my masters; to my task will I;</li>
  <li>Bonfires in France forthwith I am to make,</li>
  <li>To keep our great Saint George's feast withal:</li>
  <li class="number">Ten thousand soldiers with me I will take,</li>
  <li>Whose bloody deeds shall make all Europe quake.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Messenger</li>
  <li>So you had need; for Orleans is besieged;</li>
  <li>The English army is grown weak and faint:</li>
  <li>The Earl of Salisbury craveth supply,</li>
  <li class="number">And hardly keeps his men from mutiny,</li>
  <li>Since they, so few, watch such a multitude.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EXETER</li>
  <li>Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,</li>
  <li>Either to quell the Dauphin utterly,</li>
  <li>Or bring him in obedience to your yoke.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BEDFORD</li>
  <li class="number">I do remember it; and here take my leave,</li>
  <li>To go about my preparation.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>I'll to the Tower with all the haste I can,</li>
  <li>To view the artillery and munition;</li>
  <li>And then I will proclaim young Henry king.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EXETER</li>
  <li class="number">To Eltham will I, where the young king is,</li>
  <li>Being ordain'd his special governor,</li>
  <li>And for his safety there I'll best devise.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BISHOP OF WINCHESTER</li>
  <li>Each hath his place and function to attend:</li>
  <li>I am left out; for me nothing remains.</li>
  <li class="number">But long I will not be Jack out of office:</li>
  <li>The king from Eltham I intend to steal</li>
  <li>And sit at chiefest stern of public weal.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CHARLES</li>
  <li>Mars his true moving, even as in the heavens</li>
  <li>So in the earth, to this day is not known:</li>
  <li>Late did he shine upon the English side;</li>
  <li>Now we are victors; upon us he smiles.</li>
  <li class="number">What towns of any moment but we have?</li>
  <li>At pleasure here we lie near Orleans;</li>
  <li>Otherwhiles the famish'd English, like pale ghosts,</li>
  <li>Faintly besiege us one hour in a month.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ALENCON</li>
  <li>They want their porridge and their fat bull-beeves:</li>
  <li class="number">Either they must be dieted like mules</li>
  <li>And have their provender tied to their mouths</li>
  <li>Or piteous they will look, like drowned mice.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">REIGNIER</li>
  <li>Let's raise the siege: why live we idly here?</li>
  <li>Talbot is taken, whom we wont to fear:</li>
  <li class="number">Remaineth none but mad-brain'd Salisbury;</li>
  <li>And he may well in fretting spend his gall,</li>
  <li>Nor men nor money hath he to make war.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CHARLES</li>
  <li>Sound, sound alarum! we will rush on them.</li>
  <li>Now for the honour of the forlorn French!</li>
  <li class="number">Him I forgive my death that killeth me</li>
  <li>When he sees me go back one foot or fly.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt</div>

<div class="stage-direction">Here alarum; they are beaten back by the English

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CHARLES</li>
  <li>Who ever saw the like? what men have I!</li>
  <li>Dogs! cowards! dastards! I would ne'er have fled,</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">REIGNIER</li>
  <li class="number">Salisbury is a desperate homicide;</li>
  <li>He fighteth as one weary of his life.</li>
  <li>The other lords, like lions wanting food,</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ALENCON</li>
  <li>Froissart, a countryman of ours, records,</li>
  <li class="number">England all Olivers and Rowlands bred,</li>
  <li>During the time Edward the Third did reign.</li>
  <li>More truly now may this be verified;</li>
  <li>For none but Samsons and Goliases</li>
  <li>It sendeth forth to skirmish. One to ten!</li>
  <li class="number">Lean, raw-boned rascals! who would e'er suppose</li>
  <li>They had such courage and audacity?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CHARLES</li>
  <li>Let's leave this town; for they are hare-brain'd slaves,</li>
  <li>And hunger will enforce them to be more eager:</li>
  <li>Of old I know them; rather with their teeth</li>
  <li class="number">The walls they'll tear down than forsake the siege.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">REIGNIER</li>
  <li>I think, by some odd gimmors or device</li>
  <li>Their arms are set like clocks, stiff to strike on;</li>
  <li>Else ne'er could they hold out so as they do.</li>
  <li>By my consent, we'll even let them alone.</li>

  <li>A holy maid hither with me I bring,</li>
  <li>Which by a vision sent to her from heaven</li>
  <li>Ordained is to raise this tedious siege</li>
  <li>And drive the English forth the bounds of France.</li>
  <li class="number">The spirit of deep prophecy she hath,</li>

  <li>God's mother deigned to appear to me</li>
  <li class="number">And in a vision full of majesty</li>

  <li class="number">My courage try by combat, if thou darest,</li>
  <li>And thou shalt find that I exceed my sex.</li>

  <li class="number">Weak shoulders, overborne with burthening grief,</li>
  <li>And pithless arms, like to a wither'd vine</li>
  <li>That droops his sapless branches to the ground;</li>
  <li>Yet are these feet, whose strengthless stay is numb,</li>
  <li>Unable to support this lump of clay,</li>
  <li class="number">Swift-winged with desire to get a grave,</li>
  <li>As witting I no other comfort have.</li>
  <li>But tell me, keeper, will my nephew come?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Gaoler</li>
  <li>Richard Plantagenet, my lord, will come:</li>

<ol class="speech">

  <li>Deprived of honour and inheritance.</li>
  <li>But now the arbitrator of despairs,</li>

  <li class="number">With sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence:</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">RICHARD PLANTAGENET</li>
  <li>First, lean thine aged back against mine arm;</li>
  <li>And, in that ease, I'll tell thee my disease.</li>
  <li class="number">This day, in argument upon a case,</li>
  <li>Some words there grew 'twixt Somerset and me;</li>
  <li>Among which terms he used his lavish tongue</li>
  <li>And did upbraid me with my father's death:</li>
  <li>Which obloquy set bars before my tongue,</li>
  <li class="number">Else with the like I had requited him.</li>
  <li>Therefore, good uncle, for my father's sake,</li>
  <li>In honour of a true Plantagenet</li>
  <li>And for alliance sake, declare the cause</li>
  <li>My father, Earl of Cambridge, lost his head.</li>

  <li>Was cursed instrument of his decease.</li>

  <li>I will, if that my fading breath permit</li>

  <li>Henry the Fourth, grandfather to this king,</li>
  <li>Deposed his nephew Richard, Edward's son,</li>

  <li>During whose reign the Percies of the north,</li>
  <li>Finding his usurpation most unjust,</li>
  <li>Endeavor'd my advancement to the throne:</li>
  <li class="number">The reason moved these warlike lords to this</li>
  <li>Was, for that — young King Richard thus removed,</li>
  <li>Leaving no heir begotten of his body — </li>
  <li>I was the next by birth and parentage;</li>
  <li>For by my mother I derived am</li>
  <li class="number">From Lionel Duke of Clarence, the third son</li>
  <li>To King Edward the Third; whereas he</li>
  <li>From John of Gaunt doth bring his pedigree,</li>
  <li>Being but fourth of that heroic line.</li>
  <li>But mark: as in this haughty attempt</li>
  <li class="number">They laboured to plant the rightful heir,</li>
  <li>I lost my liberty and they their lives.</li>
  <li>Long after this, when Henry the Fifth,</li>
  <li>Succeeding his father Bolingbroke, did reign,</li>
  <li>Thy father, Earl of Cambridge, then derived</li>
  <li class="number">From famous Edmund Langley, Duke of York,</li>

  <li>Again in pity of my hard distress</li>

  <li>And have install'd me in the diadem:</li>
  <li class="number">But, as the rest, so fell that noble earl</li>
  <li>And was beheaded. Thus the Mortimers,</li>

  <li class="number">And that my fainting words do warrant death;</li>
  <li>Thou art my heir; the rest I wish thee gather:</li>
  <li>But yet be wary in thy studious care.</li>

  <li>Thanks, gentle duke. But where is Pucelle now?</li>
  <li>I think her old familiar is asleep:</li>
  <li>Now where's the Bastard's braves, and Charles his gleeks?</li>
  <li class="number">What, all amort? Rouen hangs her head for grief</li>
  <li>That such a valiant company are fled.</li>
  <li>Now will we take some order in the town,</li>
  <li>Placing therein some expert officers,</li>
  <li>And then depart to Paris to the king,</li>

  <li>The noble Duke of Bedford late deceased,</li>

  <li class="number">A braver soldier never couched lance,</li>

  <li class="speaker">JOAN LA PUCELLE</li>
  <li>Dismay not, princes, at this accident,</li>
  <li>Nor grieve that Rouen is so recovered:</li>
  <li>Care is no cure, but rather corrosive,</li>
  <li>For things that are not to be remedied.</li>
  <li class="number">Let frantic Talbot triumph for a while</li>
  <li>And like a peacock sweep along his tail;</li>
  <li>We'll pull his plumes and take away his train,</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CHARLES</li>

  <li>Ay, marry, sweeting, if we could do that,</li>

  <li>O, turn thy edged sword another way;</li>
  <li>Strike those that hurt, and hurt not those that help.</li>
  <li>One drop of blood drawn from thy country's bosom</li>
  <li class="number">Should grieve thee more than streams of foreign gore:</li>

  <li>When Talbot hath set footing once in France</li>

  <li>And thou be thrust out like a fugitive?</li>
  <li>Call we to mind, and mark but this for proof,</li>
  <li>Was not the Duke of Orleans thy foe?</li>
  <li class="number">And was he not in England prisoner?</li>
  <li>But when they heard he was thine enemy,</li>
  <li>They set him free without his ransom paid,</li>
  <li>In spite of Burgundy and all his friends.</li>
  <li>See, then, thou fight'st against thy countrymen</li>
  <li class="number">And joint'st with them will be thy slaughtermen.</li>

  <li>Shame to the Duke of Burgundy and thee!</li>

  <li>Dizzy-eyed fury and great rage of heart</li>

  <li class="speaker">MARGARET</li>

  <li>Her father is no better than an earl,</li>
  <li>Although in glorious titles he excel.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SUFFOLK</li>
  <li>Yes, lord, her father is a king,</li>
  <li class="number">The King of Naples and Jerusalem;</li>
  <li>And of such great authority in France</li>
  <li>As his alliance will confirm our peace</li>
  <li>And keep the Frenchmen in allegiance.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>And so the Earl of Armagnac may do,</li>
  <li class="number">Because he is near kinsman unto Charles.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EXETER</li>
  <li>Beside, his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower,</li>
  <li>Where Reignier sooner will receive than give.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SUFFOLK</li>
  <li>A dower, my lords! disgrace not so your king,</li>
  <li>That he should be so abject, base and poor,</li>
  <li class="number">To choose for wealth and not for perfect love.</li>
  <li>Henry is able to enrich his queen</li>
  <li>And not seek a queen to make him rich:</li>
  <li>So worthless peasants bargain for their wives,</li>
  <li>As market-men for oxen, sheep, or horse.</li>
  <li class="number">Marriage is a matter of more worth</li>
  <li>Than to be dealt in by attorneyship;</li>
  <li>Not whom we will, but whom his grace affects,</li>
  <li>Must be companion of his nuptial bed:</li>
  <li>And therefore, lords, since he affects her most,</li>
  <li class="number">It most of all these reasons bindeth us,</li>
  <li>In our opinions she should be preferr'd.</li>
  <li>For what is wedlock forced but a hell,</li>
  <li>An age of discord and continual strife?</li>
  <li>Whereas the contrary bringeth bliss,</li>
  <li class="number">And is a pattern of celestial peace.</li>
  <li>Whom should we match with Henry, being a king,</li>
  <li>But Margaret, that is daughter to a king?</li>
  <li>Her peerless feature, joined with her birth,</li>
  <li>Approves her fit for none but for a king:</li>
  <li class="number">Her valiant courage and undaunted spirit,</li>
  <li>More than in women commonly is seen,</li>
  <li>Will answer our hope in issue of a king;</li>
  <li>For Henry, son unto a conqueror,</li>
  <li>Is likely to beget more conquerors,</li>
  <li class="number">If with a lady of so high resolve</li>
  <li>As is fair Margaret he be link'd in love.</li>
  <li>Then yield, my lords; and here conclude with me</li>
  <li>That Margaret shall be queen, and none but she.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING HENRY VI</li>
  <li>Whether it be through force of your report,</li>
  <li class="number">My noble Lord of Suffolk, or for that</li>
  <li>My tender youth was never yet attaint</li>
  <li>With any passion of inflaming love,</li>
  <li>I cannot tell; but this I am assured,</li>
  <li>I feel such sharp dissension in my breast,</li>
  <li class="number">Such fierce alarums both of hope and fear,</li>
  <li>As I am sick with working of my thoughts.</li>
  <li>Take, therefore, shipping; post, my lord, to France;</li>
  <li>Agree to any covenants, and procure</li>
  <li>That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come</li>
  <li class="number">To cross the seas to England and be crown'd</li>
  <li>King Henry's faithful and anointed queen:</li>
  <li>For your expenses and sufficient charge,</li>
  <li>Among the people gather up a tenth.</li>
  <li>Be gone, I say; for, till you do return,</li>
  <li class="number">I rest perplexed with a thousand cares.</li>
  <li>And you, good uncle, banish all offence:</li>
  <li>If you do censure me by what you were,</li>
  <li>Not what you are, I know it will excuse</li>
  <li>This sudden execution of my will.</li>
  <li class="number">And so, conduct me where, from company,</li>
  <li>I may revolve and ruminate my grief.</li>

  <li>Thus Suffolk hath prevail'd; and thus he goes,</li>
  <li>As did the youthful Paris once to Greece,</li>
  <li class="number">With hope to find the like event in love,</li>
  <li>But prosper better than the Trojan did.</li>
  <li>Margaret shall now be queen, and rule the king;</li>
