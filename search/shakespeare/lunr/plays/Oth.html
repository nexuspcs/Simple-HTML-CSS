<h3>SCENE I.  Venice. A street.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter RODERIGO and IAGO</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">RODERIGO</li>
  <li>Tush! never tell me; I take it much unkindly</li>
  <li>That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse</li>
  <li>As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li>'Sblood, but you will not hear me:</li>
  <li class="number">If ever I did dream of such a matter, Abhor me.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">RODERIGO</li>
  <li>Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li>Despise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the city,</li>
  <li>In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,</li>
  <li>Off-capp'd to him: and, by the faith of man,</li>
  <li class="number">I know my price, I am worth no worse a place:</li>
  <li>But he; as loving his own pride and purposes,</li>
  <li>Evades them, with a bombast circumstance</li>
  <li>Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war;</li>
  <li>And, in conclusion,</li>
  <li class="number">Nonsuits my mediators; for, 'Certes,' says he,</li>
  <li>'I have already chose my officer.'</li>
  <li>And what was he?</li>
  <li>Forsooth, a great arithmetician,</li>
  <li>One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,</li>
  <li class="number">A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife;</li>
  <li>That never set a squadron in the field,</li>
  <li>Nor the division of a battle knows</li>
  <li>More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,</li>
  <li>Wherein the toged consuls can propose</li>
  <li class="number">As masterly as he: mere prattle, without practise,</li>
  <li>Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election:</li>
  <li>And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof</li>
  <li>At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds</li>
  <li>Christian and heathen, must be be-lee'd and calm'd</li>
  <li class="number">By debitor and creditor: this counter-caster,</li>
  <li>He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,</li>
  <li>And I — God bless the mark! — his Moorship's ancient.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">RODERIGO</li>
  <li>By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li>Why, there's no remedy; 'tis the curse of service,</li>
  <li class="number">Preferment goes by letter and affection,</li>
  <li>And not by old gradation, where each second</li>
  <li>Stood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself,</li>
  <li>Whether I in any just term am affined</li>
  <li>To love the Moor.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">RODERIGO</li>
  <li class="number">I would not follow him then.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li>O, sir, content you;</li>
  <li>I follow him to serve my turn upon him:</li>
  <li>We cannot all be masters, nor all masters</li>
  <li>Cannot be truly follow'd. You shall mark</li>
  <li class="number">Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave,</li>
  <li>That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,</li>
  <li>Wears out his time, much like his master's ass,</li>
  <li>For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd:</li>
  <li>Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are</li>
  <li class="number">Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty,</li>
  <li>Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,</li>
  <li>And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,</li>
  <li>Do well thrive by them and when they have lined</li>
  <li>their coats</li>
  <li class="number">Do themselves homage: these fellows have some soul;</li>
  <li>And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,</li>
  <li>It is as sure as you are Roderigo,</li>
  <li>Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago:</li>
  <li>In following him, I follow but myself;</li>
  <li class="number">Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,</li>
  <li>But seeming so, for my peculiar end:</li>
  <li>For when my outward action doth demonstrate</li>
  <li>The native act and figure of my heart</li>
  <li>In compliment extern, 'tis not long after</li>
  <li class="number">But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve</li>
  <li>For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">RODERIGO</li>
  <li>What a full fortune does the thicklips owe</li>
  <li>If he can carry't thus!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li>Call up her father,</li>
  <li class="number">Rouse him: make after him, poison his delight,</li>
  <li>Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,</li>
  <li>And, though he in a fertile climate dwell,</li>
  <li>Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,</li>
  <li>Yet throw such changes of vexation on't,</li>
  <li class="number">As it may lose some colour.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">RODERIGO</li>
  <li>Here is her father's house; I'll call aloud.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li>Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell</li>
  <li>As when, by night and negligence, the fire</li>
  <li>Is spied in populous cities.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">RODERIGO</li>
  <li class="number">What, ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li>Awake! what, ho, Brabantio! thieves! thieves! thieves!</li>
  <li>Look to your house, your daughter and your bags!</li>
  <li>Thieves! thieves!</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">BRABANTIO appears above, at a window</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRABANTIO</li>
  <li>What is the reason of this terrible summons?</li>
  <li class="number">What is the matter there?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">RODERIGO</li>
  <li>Signior, is all your family within?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li>Are your doors lock'd?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRABANTIO</li>
  <li>Why, wherefore ask you this?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li>'Zounds, sir, you're robb'd; for shame, put on</li>
  <li class="number">your gown;</li>
  <li>Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;</li>
  <li>Even now, now, very now, an old black ram</li>
  <li>Is topping your white ewe. Arise, arise;</li>
  <li>Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,</li>
  <li class="number">Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you:</li>
  <li>Arise, I say.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRABANTIO</li>
  <li>What, have you lost your wits?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">RODERIGO</li>
  <li>Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRABANTIO</li>
  <li>Not I what are you?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">RODERIGO</li>
  <li class="number">My name is Roderigo.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRABANTIO</li>
  <li>The worser welcome:</li>
  <li>I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors:</li>
  <li>In honest plainness thou hast heard me say</li>
  <li>My daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness,</li>
  <li class="number">Being full of supper and distempering draughts,</li>
  <li>Upon malicious bravery, dost thou come</li>
  <li>To start my quiet.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">RODERIGO</li>
  <li>Sir, sir, sir —  </li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRABANTIO</li>
  <li>But thou must needs be sure</li>
  <li class="number">My spirit and my place have in them power</li>
  <li>To make this bitter to thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">RODERIGO</li>
  <li>Patience, good sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRABANTIO</li>
  <li>What tell'st thou me of robbing? this is Venice;</li>
  <li>My house is not a grange.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">RODERIGO</li>
  <li class="number">Most grave Brabantio,</li>
  <li>In simple and pure soul I come to you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li>'Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not</li>
  <li>serve God, if the devil bid you. Because we come to</li>
  <li>do you service and you think we are ruffians, you'll</li>
  <li class="number">have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse;</li>
  <li>you'll have your nephews neigh to you; you'll have</li>
  <li>coursers for cousins and gennets for germans.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRABANTIO</li>
  <li>What profane wretch art thou?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li>I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter</li>
  <li class="number">and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRABANTIO</li>
  <li>Thou art a villain.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li>You are — a senator.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRABANTIO</li>
  <li>This thou shalt answer; I know thee, Roderigo.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">RODERIGO</li>
  <li>Sir, I will answer any thing. But, I beseech you,</li>
  <li class="number">If't be your pleasure and most wise consent,</li>
  <li>As partly I find it is, that your fair daughter,</li>
  <li>At this odd-even and dull watch o' the night,</li>
  <li>Transported, with no worse nor better guard</li>
  <li>But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,</li>
  <li class="number">To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor — </li>
  <li>If this be known to you and your allowance,</li>
  <li>We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs;</li>
  <li>But if you know not this, my manners tell me</li>
  <li>We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe</li>
  <li class="number">That, from the sense of all civility,</li>
  <li>I thus would play and trifle with your reverence:</li>
  <li>Your daughter, if you have not given her leave,</li>
  <li>I say again, hath made a gross revolt;</li>
  <li>Tying her duty, beauty, wit and fortunes</li>
  <li class="number">In an extravagant and wheeling stranger</li>
  <li>Of here and every where. Straight satisfy yourself:</li>
  <li>If she be in her chamber or your house,</li>
  <li>Let loose on me the justice of the state</li>
  <li>For thus deluding you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRABANTIO</li>
  <li class="number">Strike on the tinder, ho!</li>
  <li>Give me a taper! call up all my people!</li>
  <li>This accident is not unlike my dream:</li>
  <li>Belief of it oppresses me already.</li>
  <li>Light, I say! light!</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit above</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li class="number">Farewell; for I must leave you:</li>
  <li>It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place,</li>
  <li>To be produced — as, if I stay, I shall — </li>
  <li>Against the Moor: for, I do know, the state,</li>
  <li>However this may gall him with some cheque,</li>
  <li class="number">Cannot with safety cast him, for he's embark'd</li>
  <li>With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,</li>
  <li>Which even now stand in act, that, for their souls,</li>
  <li>Another of his fathom they have none,</li>
  <li>To lead their business: in which regard,</li>
  <li class="number">Though I do hate him as I do hell-pains.</li>
  <li>Yet, for necessity of present life,</li>
  <li>I must show out a flag and sign of love,</li>
  <li>Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,</li>
  <li>Lead to the Sagittary the raised search;</li>
  <li class="number">And there will I be with him. So, farewell.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit</div>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter, below, BRABANTIO, and Servants with torches</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRABANTIO</li>
  <li>It is too true an evil: gone she is;</li>
  <li>And what's to come of my despised time</li>
  <li>Is nought but bitterness. Now, Roderigo,</li>
  <li>Where didst thou see her? O unhappy girl!</li>
  <li class="number">With the Moor, say'st thou? Who would be a father!</li>
  <li>How didst thou know 'twas she? O she deceives me</li>
  <li>Past thought! What said she to you? Get more tapers:</li>
  <li>Raise all my kindred. Are they married, think you?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">RODERIGO</li>
  <li>Truly, I think they are.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRABANTIO</li>
  <li class="number">O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood!</li>
  <li>Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters' minds</li>
  <li>By what you see them act. Is there not charms</li>
  <li>By which the property of youth and maidhood</li>
  <li>May be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo,</li>
  <li class="number">Of some such thing?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">RODERIGO</li>
  <li>Yes, sir, I have indeed.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRABANTIO</li>
  <li>Call up my brother. O, would you had had her!</li>
  <li>Some one way, some another. Do you know</li>
  <li>Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">RODERIGO</li>
  <li class="number">I think I can discover him, if you please,</li>
  <li>To get good guard and go along with me.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRABANTIO</li>
  <li>Pray you, lead on. At every house I'll call;</li>
  <li>I may command at most. Get weapons, ho!</li>
  <li>And raise some special officers of night.</li>
  <li class="number">On, good Roderigo: I'll deserve your pains.</li>

<h3>SCENE II.  Another street.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter OTHELLO, IAGO, and Attendants with torches</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li>Though in the trade of war I have slain men,</li>
  <li>Yet do I hold it very stuff o' the conscience</li>
  <li>To do no contrived murder: I lack iniquity</li>
  <li>Sometimes to do me service: nine or ten times</li>
  <li class="number">I had thought to have yerk'd him here under the ribs.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>'Tis better as it is.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li>Nay, but he prated,</li>
  <li>And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms</li>
  <li>Against your honour</li>
  <li class="number">That, with the little godliness I have,</li>
  <li>I did full hard forbear him. But, I pray you, sir,</li>
  <li>Are you fast married? Be assured of this,</li>
  <li>That the magnifico is much beloved,</li>
  <li>And hath in his effect a voice potential</li>
  <li class="number">As double as the duke's: he will divorce you;</li>
  <li>Or put upon you what restraint and grievance</li>
  <li>The law, with all his might to enforce it on,</li>
  <li>Will give him cable.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>Let him do his spite:</li>
  <li class="number">My services which I have done the signiory</li>
  <li>Shall out-tongue his complaints. 'Tis yet to know —  </li>
  <li>Which, when I know that boasting is an honour,</li>
  <li>I shall promulgate — I fetch my life and being</li>
  <li>From men of royal siege, and my demerits</li>
  <li class="number">May speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune</li>
  <li>As this that I have reach'd: for know, Iago,</li>
  <li>But that I love the gentle Desdemona,</li>
  <li>I would not my unhoused free condition</li>
  <li>Put into circumscription and confine</li>
  <li class="number">For the sea's worth. But, look! what lights come yond?</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASSIO</li>
  <li>Something from Cyprus as I may divine:</li>
  <li class="number">It is a business of some heat: the galleys</li>

  <li>This very night at one another's heels,</li>
  <li>And many of the consuls, raised and met,</li>
  <li>Are at the duke's already: you have been</li>
  <li class="number">hotly call'd for;</li>
  <li>When, being not at your lodging to be found,</li>

  <li>If she in chains of magic were not bound,</li>
  <li>Whether a maid so tender, fair and happy,</li>
  <li class="number">So opposite to marriage that she shunned</li>
  <li>The wealthy curled darlings of our nation,</li>
  <li>Would ever have, to incur a general mock,</li>

  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,</li>
  <li>My very noble and approved good masters,</li>
  <li>That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter,</li>
  <li>It is most true; true, I have married her:</li>
  <li class="number">The very head and front of my offending</li>
  <li>Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,</li>
  <li>And little bless'd with the soft phrase of peace:</li>
  <li>For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith,</li>
  <li>Till now some nine moons wasted, they have used</li>
  <li class="number">Their dearest action in the tented field,</li>
  <li>And little of this great world can I speak,</li>
  <li>More than pertains to feats of broil and battle,</li>
  <li>And therefore little shall I grace my cause</li>
  <li>In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience,</li>
  <li class="number">I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver</li>
  <li>Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms,</li>
  <li>What conjuration and what mighty magic,</li>
  <li>For such proceeding I am charged withal,</li>
  <li>I won his daughter.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRABANTIO</li>
  <li class="number">A maiden never bold;</li>
  <li>Of spirit so still and quiet, that her motion</li>
  <li>Blush'd at herself; and she, in spite of nature,</li>
  <li>Of years, of country, credit, every thing,</li>
  <li>To fall in love with what she fear'd to look on!</li>
  <li class="number">It is a judgment maim'd and most imperfect</li>
  <li>That will confess perfection so could err</li>
  <li>Against all rules of nature, and must be driven</li>
  <li>To find out practises of cunning hell,</li>
  <li>Why this should be. I therefore vouch again</li>
  <li class="number">That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood,</li>
  <li>Or with some dram conjured to this effect,</li>
  <li>He wrought upon her.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DUKE OF VENICE</li>
  <li>To vouch this, is no proof,</li>
  <li>Without more wider and more overt test</li>

  <li>Her father loved me; oft invited me;</li>
  <li>Still question'd me the story of my life,</li>
  <li>From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes,</li>
  <li class="number">That I have passed.</li>
  <li>I ran it through, even from my boyish days,</li>
  <li>To the very moment that he bade me tell it;</li>
  <li>Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances,</li>
  <li>Of moving accidents by flood and field</li>
  <li class="number">Of hair-breadth scapes i' the imminent deadly breach,</li>
  <li>Of being taken by the insolent foe</li>
  <li>And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence</li>
  <li>And portance in my travels' history:</li>
  <li>Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,</li>
  <li class="number">Rough quarries, rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven</li>
  <li>It was my hint to speak —  such was the process;</li>
  <li>And of the Cannibals that each other eat,</li>
  <li>The Anthropophagi and men whose heads</li>
  <li>Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear</li>
  <li class="number">Would Desdemona seriously incline:</li>
  <li>But still the house-affairs would draw her thence:</li>
  <li>Which ever as she could with haste dispatch,</li>
  <li>She'ld come again, and with a greedy ear</li>
  <li>Devour up my discourse: which I observing,</li>
  <li class="number">Took once a pliant hour, and found good means</li>
  <li>To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart</li>
  <li>That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,</li>
  <li>Whereof by parcels she had something heard,</li>
  <li>But not intentively: I did consent,</li>
  <li class="number">And often did beguile her of her tears,</li>
  <li>When I did speak of some distressful stroke</li>
  <li>That my youth suffer'd. My story being done,</li>
  <li>She gave me for my pains a world of sighs:</li>
  <li>She swore, in faith, twas strange, 'twas passing strange,</li>
  <li class="number">'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful:</li>
  <li>She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd</li>
  <li>That heaven had made her such a man: she thank'd me,</li>
  <li>And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,</li>
  <li>I should but teach him how to tell my story.</li>
  <li class="number">And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:</li>
  <li>She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd,</li>
  <li>And I loved her that she did pity them.</li>
  <li>This only is the witchcraft I have used:</li>
  <li>Here comes the lady; let her witness it.</li>

  <li class="number">By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.</li>
  <li>To mourn a mischief that is past and gone</li>

  <li>thou silly gentleman!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">RODERIGO</li>
  <li>It is silliness to live when to live is torment; and</li>
  <li>then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li>O villainous! I have looked upon the world for four</li>
  <li class="number">times seven years; and since I could distinguish</li>
  <li>betwixt a benefit and an injury, I never found man</li>
  <li>that knew how to love himself. Ere I would say, I</li>
  <li>would drown myself for the love of a guinea-hen, I</li>
  <li>would change my humanity with a baboon.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">RODERIGO</li>
  <li class="number">What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so</li>
  <li>fond; but it is not in my virtue to amend it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li>Virtue! a fig! 'tis in ourselves that we are thus</li>
  <li>or thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which</li>
  <li>our wills are gardeners: so that if we will plant</li>
  <li class="number">nettles, or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up</li>
  <li>thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs, or</li>
  <li>distract it with many, either to have it sterile</li>
  <li>with idleness, or manured with industry, why, the</li>
  <li>power and corrigible authority of this lies in our</li>
  <li class="number">wills. If the balance of our lives had not one</li>
  <li>scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the</li>
  <li>blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us</li>
  <li>to most preposterous conclusions: but we have</li>
  <li>reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal</li>
  <li class="number">stings, our unbitted lusts, whereof I take this that</li>
  <li>you call love to be a sect or scion.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">RODERIGO</li>
  <li>It cannot be.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li>It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of</li>
  <li>the will. Come, be a man. Drown thyself! drown</li>
  <li class="number">cats and blind puppies. I have professed me thy</li>
  <li>friend and I confess me knit to thy deserving with</li>
  <li>cables of perdurable toughness; I could never</li>
  <li>better stead thee than now. Put money in thy</li>
  <li>purse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favour with</li>
  <li class="number">an usurped beard; I say, put money in thy purse. It</li>
  <li>cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her</li>
  <li>love to the Moor —   put money in thy purse —  nor he</li>
  <li>his to her: it was a violent commencement, and thou</li>
  <li>shalt see an answerable sequestration: — put but</li>
  <li class="number">money in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in</li>
  <li>their wills: fill thy purse with money: — the food</li>
  <li>that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be</li>
  <li>to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida. She must</li>
  <li>change for youth: when she is sated with his body,</li>
  <li class="number">she will find the error of her choice: she must</li>
  <li>have change, she must: therefore put money in thy</li>
  <li>purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a</li>
  <li>more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money</li>
  <li>thou canst: if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt</li>
  <li class="number">an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian not</li>
  <li>too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thou</li>
  <li>shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox of</li>
  <li>drowning thyself! it is clean out of the way: seek</li>
  <li>thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than</li>
  <li class="number">to be drowned and go without her.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">RODERIGO</li>
  <li>Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on</li>
  <li>the issue?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li>Thou art sure of me: — go, make money: — I have told</li>
  <li>thee often, and I re-tell thee again and again, I</li>
  <li class="number">hate the Moor: my cause is hearted; thine hath no</li>
  <li>less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge</li>
  <li>against him: if thou canst cuckold him, thou dost</li>
  <li>thyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are many</li>
  <li>events in the womb of time which will be delivered.</li>
  <li class="number">Traverse! go, provide thy money. We will have more</li>
  <li>of this to-morrow. Adieu.</li>

  <li>O most lame and impotent conclusion! Do not learn</li>

  <li>You say true; 'tis so, indeed: if such tricks as</li>

  <li>My dear Othello!</li>

  <li>It gives me wonder great as my content</li>

  <li>If after every tempest come such calms,</li>

  <li class="number">Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed.</li>
  <li>Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor,</li>
  <li>but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies:</li>
  <li>and will she love him still for prating? let not</li>
  <li>thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed;</li>
  <li class="number">and what delight shall she have to look on the</li>
  <li>devil? When the blood is made dull with the act of</li>
  <li>sport, there should be, again to inflame it and to</li>
  <li>give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favour,</li>
  <li>sympathy in years, manners and beauties; all which</li>
  <li class="number">the Moor is defective in: now, for want of these</li>
  <li>required conveniences, her delicate tenderness will</li>
  <li>find itself abused, begin to heave the gorge,</li>
  <li>disrelish and abhor the Moor; very nature will</li>
  <li>instruct her in it and compel her to some second</li>
  <li class="number">choice. Now, sir, this granted —  as it is a most</li>
  <li>pregnant and unforced position — who stands so</li>
  <li>eminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio</li>
  <li>does? a knave very voluble; no further</li>
  <li>conscionable than in putting on the mere form of</li>
  <li class="number">civil and humane seeming, for the better compassing</li>
  <li>of his salt and most hidden loose affection? why,</li>
  <li>none; why, none: a slipper and subtle knave, a</li>
  <li>finder of occasions, that has an eye can stamp and</li>
  <li>counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never</li>
  <li class="number">present itself; a devilish knave. Besides, the</li>
  <li>knave is handsome, young, and hath all those</li>
  <li>requisites in him that folly and green minds look</li>
  <li>after: a pestilent complete knave; and the woman</li>
  <li>hath found him already.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">RODERIGO</li>
  <li class="number">I cannot believe that in her; she's full of</li>

  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li>Blessed fig's-end! the wine she drinks is made of</li>

  <li class="number">not see her paddle with the palm of his hand? didst</li>
  <li>not mark that?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">RODERIGO</li>
  <li>Yes, that I did; but that was but courtesy.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li>Lechery, by this hand; an index and obscure prologue</li>
  <li>to the history of lust and foul thoughts. They met</li>
  <li class="number">so near with their lips that their breaths embraced</li>
  <li>together. Villanous thoughts, Roderigo! when these</li>
  <li>mutualities so marshal the way, hard at hand comes</li>
  <li>the master and main exercise, the incorporate</li>
  <li>conclusion, Pish! But, sir, be you ruled by me: I</li>
  <li class="number">have brought you from Venice. Watch you to-night;</li>
  <li>for the command, I'll lay't upon you. Cassio knows</li>
  <li>you not. I'll not be far from you: do you find</li>
  <li>some occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking</li>
  <li>too loud, or tainting his discipline; or from what</li>
  <li class="number">other course you please, which the time shall more</li>
  <li>favourably minister.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">RODERIGO</li>
  <li>Well.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li>Sir, he is rash and very sudden in choler, and haply</li>
  <li>may strike at you: provoke him, that he may; for</li>
  <li class="number">even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to</li>
  <li>mutiny; whose qualification shall come into no true</li>
  <li>taste again but by the displanting of Cassio. So</li>
  <li>shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by</li>
  <li>the means I shall then have to prefer them; and the</li>
  <li class="number">impediment most profitably removed, without the</li>
  <li>which there were no expectation of our prosperity.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">RODERIGO</li>
  <li>I will do this, if I can bring it to any</li>
  <li>opportunity.</li>
</ol>

  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li>I warrant thee. Meet me by and by at the citadel:</li>

  <li>The Moor, howbeit that I endure him not,</li>
  <li class="number">Is of a constant, loving, noble nature,</li>
  <li>And I dare think he'll prove to Desdemona</li>

  <li>Not out of absolute lust, though peradventure</li>
  <li>I stand accountant for as great a sin,</li>
  <li class="number">But partly led to diet my revenge,</li>

  <li>If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trash</li>

  <li class="number">Not this hour, lieutenant; 'tis not yet ten o' the</li>

  <li>Worthy Montano, you were wont be civil;</li>
  <li class="number">The gravity and stillness of your youth</li>
  <li>The world hath noted, and your name is great</li>
  <li>In mouths of wisest censure: what's the matter,</li>

  <li class="speaker">MONTANO</li>
  <li>Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger:</li>
  <li>Your officer, Iago, can inform you —  </li>
  <li>While I spare speech, which something now</li>
  <li>offends me —  </li>
  <li class="number">Of all that I do know: nor know I aught</li>
  <li>By me that's said or done amiss this night;</li>
  <li>Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice,</li>

  <li class="number">Now, by heaven,</li>
  <li>My blood begins my safer guides to rule;</li>
  <li>And passion, having my best judgment collied,</li>
  <li>Assays to lead the way: if I once stir,</li>
  <li>Or do but lift this arm, the best of you</li>
  <li class="number">Shall sink in my rebuke. Give me to know</li>
  <li>How this foul rout began, who set it on;</li>
  <li>And he that is approved in this offence,</li>
  <li>Though he had twinn'd with me, both at a birth,</li>
  <li>Shall lose me. What! in a town of war,</li>
  <li class="number">Yet wild, the people's hearts brimful of fear,</li>
  <li>To manage private and domestic quarrel,</li>
  <li>In night, and on the court and guard of safety!</li>
  <li>'Tis monstrous. Iago, who began't?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MONTANO</li>
  <li>If partially affined, or leagued in office,</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li>Touch me not so near:</li>
  <li>I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth</li>
  <li>Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio;</li>
  <li class="number">Yet, I persuade myself, to speak the truth</li>
  <li>Shall nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general.</li>
  <li>Montano and myself being in speech,</li>
  <li>There comes a fellow crying out for help:</li>
  <li>And Cassio following him with determined sword,</li>
  <li class="number">To execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman</li>
  <li>Steps in to Cassio, and entreats his pause:</li>
  <li>Myself the crying fellow did pursue,</li>
  <li>Lest by his clamour — as it so fell out — </li>
  <li>The town might fall in fright: he, swift of foot,</li>
  <li class="number">Outran my purpose; and I return'd the rather</li>
  <li>For that I heard the clink and fall of swords,</li>
  <li>And Cassio high in oath; which till to-night</li>
  <li>I ne'er might say before. When I came back — </li>
  <li>For this was brief — I found them close together,</li>
  <li class="number">At blow and thrust; even as again they were</li>
  <li>When you yourself did part them.</li>
  <li>More of this matter cannot I report:</li>
  <li>But men are men; the best sometimes forget:</li>
  <li>Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,</li>
  <li class="number">As men in rage strike those that wish them best,</li>
  <li>Yet surely Cassio, I believe, received</li>
  <li>From him that fled some strange indignity,</li>
  <li>Which patience could not pass.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>I know, Iago,</li>
  <li class="number">Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter,</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASSIO</li>
  <li>It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place</li>

  <li>You or any man living may be drunk! at a time, man.</li>

  <li>that he hath devoted and given up himself to the</li>
  <li class="number">contemplation, mark, and denotement of her parts and</li>
  <li>graces: confess yourself freely to her; importune</li>
  <li>her help to put you in your place again: she is of</li>
  <li>so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition,</li>
  <li>she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more</li>
  <li class="number">than she is requested: this broken joint between</li>
  <li>you and her husband entreat her to splinter; and, my</li>
  <li>fortunes against any lay worth naming, this</li>

  <li>The general and his wife are talking of it;</li>

  <li class="number">And great affinity, and that in wholesome wisdom</li>
  <li>He might not but refuse you; but he protests he loves you</li>

  <li class="speaker">CASSIO</li>
  <li>Bounteous madam,</li>

<ol class="speech">

  <li>To the last article: my lord shall never rest;</li>
  <li class="number">I'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience;</li>
  <li>His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;</li>
  <li>I'll intermingle every thing he does</li>

  <li>Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord,</li>
  <li class="number">If I have any grace or power to move you,</li>
  <li>His present reconciliation take;</li>
  <li>For if he be not one that truly loves you,</li>
  <li>That errs in ignorance and not in cunning,</li>
  <li>I have no judgment in an honest face:</li>

  <li>Why, then, to-morrow night; or Tuesday morn;</li>
  <li>On Tuesday noon, or night; on Wednesday morn:</li>
  <li class="number">I prithee, name the time, but let it not</li>
  <li>Exceed three days: in faith, he's penitent;</li>
  <li>And yet his trespass, in our common reason — </li>
  <li>Save that, they say, the wars must make examples</li>
  <li>Out of their best — is not almost a fault</li>
  <li class="number">To incur a private cheque. When shall he come?</li>
  <li>Tell me, Othello: I wonder in my soul,</li>
  <li>What you would ask me, that I should deny,</li>
  <li>Or stand so mammering on. What! Michael Cassio,</li>
  <li>That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time,</li>
  <li class="number">When I have spoke of you dispraisingly,</li>
  <li>Hath ta'en your part; to have so much to do</li>
  <li>To bring him in! Trust me, I could do much —  </li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>Prithee, no more: let him come when he will;</li>

  <li class="speaker">DESDEMONA</li>

  <li>Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit</li>
  <li>To your own person: nay, when I have a suit</li>
  <li class="number">Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed,</li>
  <li>It shall be full of poise and difficult weight</li>
  <li>And fearful to be granted.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>I will deny thee nothing:</li>
  <li>Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,</li>

  <li>What dost thou say, Iago?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li class="number">Did Michael Cassio, when you woo'd my lady,</li>
  <li>Know of your love?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>He did, from first to last: why dost thou ask?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li>But for a satisfaction of my thought;</li>
  <li>No further harm.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li class="number">Why of thy thought, Iago?</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li>I did not think he had been acquainted with her.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>O, yes; and went between us very oft.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li>Indeed!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>Indeed! ay, indeed: discern'st thou aught in that?</li>
  <li class="number">Is he not honest?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li>Honest, my lord!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>Honest! ay, honest.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li>My lord, for aught I know.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>What dost thou think?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li class="number">Think, my lord!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>Think, my lord!</li>
  <li>By heaven, he echoes me,</li>
  <li>As if there were some monster in his thought</li>
  <li>Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something:</li>
  <li class="number">I heard thee say even now, thou likedst not that,</li>
  <li>When Cassio left my wife: what didst not like?</li>
  <li>And when I told thee he was of my counsel</li>
  <li>In my whole course of wooing, thou criedst 'Indeed!'</li>
  <li>And didst contract and purse thy brow together,</li>
  <li class="number">As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain</li>
  <li>Some horrible conceit: if thou dost love me,</li>
  <li>Show me thy thought.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li>My lord, you know I love you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>I think thou dost;</li>
  <li class="number">And, for I know thou'rt full of love and honesty,</li>
  <li>And weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath,</li>
  <li>Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more:</li>
  <li>For such things in a false disloyal knave</li>
  <li>Are tricks of custom, but in a man that's just</li>
  <li class="number">They are close delations, working from the heart</li>
  <li>That passion cannot rule.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li>For Michael Cassio,</li>
  <li>I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>I think so too.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li class="number">Men should be what they seem;</li>
  <li>Or those that be not, would they might seem none!</li>

  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>Certain, men should be what they seem.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li>Why, then, I think Cassio's an honest man.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>Nay, yet there's more in this:</li>
  <li class="number">I prithee, speak to me as to thy thinkings,</li>
  <li>As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts</li>
  <li>The worst of words.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li>Good my lord, pardon me:</li>
  <li>Though I am bound to every act of duty,</li>
  <li class="number">I am not bound to that all slaves are free to.</li>
  <li>Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false;</li>
  <li>As where's that palace whereinto foul things</li>
  <li>Sometimes intrude not? who has a breast so pure,</li>
  <li>But some uncleanly apprehensions</li>
  <li class="number">Keep leets and law-days and in session sit</li>
  <li>With meditations lawful?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,</li>
  <li>If thou but think'st him wrong'd and makest his ear</li>
  <li>A stranger to thy thoughts.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li class="number">I do beseech you — </li>
  <li>Though I perchance am vicious in my guess,</li>
  <li>As, I confess, it is my nature's plague</li>
  <li>To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy</li>
  <li>Shapes faults that are not — that your wisdom yet,</li>
  <li class="number">From one that so imperfectly conceits,</li>
  <li>Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble</li>
  <li>Out of his scattering and unsure observance.</li>
  <li>It were not for your quiet nor your good,</li>
  <li>Nor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom,</li>
  <li class="number">To let you know my thoughts.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>What dost thou mean?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li>Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,</li>
  <li>Is the immediate jewel of their souls:</li>
  <li>Who steals my purse steals trash; 'tis something, nothing;</li>
  <li class="number">'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands:</li>
  <li>But he that filches from me my good name</li>
  <li>Robs me of that which not enriches him</li>
  <li>And makes me poor indeed.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>By heaven, I'll know thy thoughts.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li class="number">You cannot, if my heart were in your hand;</li>
  <li>Nor shall not, whilst 'tis in my custody.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>Ha!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li>O, beware, my lord, of jealousy;</li>
  <li>It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock</li>
  <li class="number">The meat it feeds on; that cuckold lives in bliss</li>
  <li>Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;</li>
  <li>But, O, what damned minutes tells he o'er</li>
  <li>Who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>O misery!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li class="number">Poor and content is rich and rich enough,</li>
  <li>But riches fineless is as poor as winter</li>
  <li>To him that ever fears he shall be poor.</li>
  <li>Good heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend</li>
  <li>From jealousy!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li class="number">Why, why is this?</li>
  <li>Think'st thou I'ld make a lie of jealousy,</li>
  <li>To follow still the changes of the moon</li>
  <li>With fresh suspicions? No; to be once in doubt</li>
  <li>Is once to be resolved: exchange me for a goat,</li>
  <li class="number">When I shall turn the business of my soul</li>
  <li>To such exsufflicate and blown surmises,</li>
  <li>Matching thy inference. 'Tis not to make me jealous</li>
  <li>To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,</li>
  <li>Is free of speech, sings, plays and dances well;</li>
  <li class="number">Where virtue is, these are more virtuous:</li>
  <li>Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw</li>
  <li>The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt;</li>
  <li>For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago;</li>
  <li>I'll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;</li>
  <li class="number">And on the proof, there is no more but this —  </li>
  <li>Away at once with love or jealousy!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li>I am glad of it; for now I shall have reason</li>
  <li>To show the love and duty that I bear you</li>
  <li>With franker spirit: therefore, as I am bound,</li>
  <li class="number">Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.</li>
  <li>Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;</li>
  <li>Wear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure:</li>
  <li>I would not have your free and noble nature,</li>
  <li>Out of self-bounty, be abused; look to't:</li>
  <li class="number">I know our country disposition well;</li>
  <li>In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks</li>
  <li>They dare not show their husbands; their best conscience</li>
  <li>Is not to leave't undone, but keep't unknown.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>Dost thou say so?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li class="number">She did deceive her father, marrying you;</li>
  <li>And when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks,</li>
  <li>She loved them most.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>And so she did.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li>Why, go to then;</li>
  <li class="number">She that, so young, could give out such a seeming,</li>
  <li>To seal her father's eyes up close as oak-</li>
  <li>He thought 'twas witchcraft — but I am much to blame;</li>
  <li>I humbly do beseech you of your pardon</li>
  <li>For too much loving you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li class="number">I am bound to thee for ever.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li>I see this hath a little dash'd your spirits.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>Not a jot, not a jot.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li>I' faith, I fear it has.</li>
  <li>I hope you will consider what is spoke</li>
  <li class="number">Comes from my love. But I do see you're moved:</li>
  <li>I am to pray you not to strain my speech</li>
  <li>To grosser issues nor to larger reach</li>
  <li>Than to suspicion.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>I will not.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li class="number">Should you do so, my lord,</li>
  <li>My speech should fall into such vile success</li>
  <li>As my thoughts aim not at. Cassio's my worthy friend — </li>
  <li>My lord, I see you're moved.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>No, not much moved:</li>
  <li class="number">I do not think but Desdemona's honest.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li>Long live she so! and long live you to think so!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>And yet, how nature erring from itself —  </li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li>Ay, there's the point: as — to be bold with you — </li>
  <li>Not to affect many proposed matches</li>
  <li class="number">Of her own clime, complexion, and degree,</li>
  <li>Whereto we see in all things nature tends — </li>
  <li>Foh! one may smell in such a will most rank,</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li class="number">My noble lord —  </li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>If thou dost slander her and torture me,</li>
  <li>Never pray more; abandon all remorse;</li>
  <li>On horror's head horrors accumulate;</li>
  <li>Do deeds to make heaven weep, all earth amazed;</li>
  <li class="number">For nothing canst thou to damnation add</li>
  <li>Greater than that.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li>O grace! O heaven forgive me!</li>
  <li>Are you a man? have you a soul or sense?</li>
  <li>God be wi' you; take mine office. O wretched fool.</li>
  <li class="number">That livest to make thine honesty a vice!</li>
  <li>O monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world,</li>
  <li>To be direct and honest is not safe.</li>
  <li>I thank you for this profit; and from hence</li>
  <li>I'll love no friend, sith love breeds such offence.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li class="number">Nay, stay: thou shouldst be honest.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li>I should be wise, for honesty's a fool</li>
  <li>And loses that it works for.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>By the world,</li>
  <li>I think my wife be honest and think she is not;</li>
  <li class="number">I think that thou art just and think thou art not.</li>
  <li>I'll have some proof. Her name, that was as fresh</li>
  <li>As Dian's visage, is now begrimed and black</li>
  <li>As mine own face. If there be cords, or knives,</li>
  <li>Poison, or fire, or suffocating streams,</li>
  <li class="number">I'll not endure it. Would I were satisfied!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li>I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion:</li>
  <li>I do repent me that I put it to you.</li>
  <li>You would be satisfied?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>Would! nay, I will.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li class="number">And may: but, how? how satisfied, my lord?</li>
  <li>Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on — </li>
  <li>Behold her topp'd?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>Death and damnation! O!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li>It were a tedious difficulty, I think,</li>
  <li class="number">To bring them to that prospect: damn them then,</li>
  <li>If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster</li>
  <li>More than their own! What then? how then?</li>
  <li>What shall I say? Where's satisfaction?</li>
  <li>It is impossible you should see this,</li>
  <li class="number">Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,</li>
  <li>As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross</li>
  <li>As ignorance made drunk. But yet, I say,</li>
  <li>If imputation and strong circumstances,</li>
  <li>Which lead directly to the door of truth,</li>
  <li class="number">Will give you satisfaction, you may have't.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>Give me a living reason she's disloyal.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li>I do not like the office:</li>
  <li>But, sith I am enter'd in this cause so far,</li>
  <li>Prick'd to't by foolish honesty and love,</li>
  <li class="number">I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately;</li>
  <li>And, being troubled with a raging tooth,</li>
  <li>I could not sleep.</li>
  <li>There are a kind of men so loose of soul,</li>
  <li>That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs:</li>
  <li class="number">One of this kind is Cassio:</li>
  <li>In sleep I heard him say 'Sweet Desdemona,</li>
  <li>Let us be wary, let us hide our loves;'</li>
  <li>And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,</li>
  <li>Cry 'O sweet creature!' and then kiss me hard,</li>
  <li class="number">As if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots</li>
  <li>That grew upon my lips: then laid his leg</li>
  <li>Over my thigh, and sigh'd, and kiss'd; and then</li>
  <li>Cried 'Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!'</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>O monstrous! monstrous!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li class="number">Nay, this was but his dream.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>But this denoted a foregone conclusion:</li>
  <li>'Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li>And this may help to thicken other proofs</li>
  <li>That do demonstrate thinly.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li class="number">I'll tear her all to pieces.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li>Nay, but be wise: yet we see nothing done;</li>
  <li>She may be honest yet. Tell me but this,</li>
  <li>Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief</li>
  <li>Spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li class="number">I gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li>I know not that; but such a handkerchief — </li>
  <li>I am sure it was your wife's — did I to-day</li>
  <li>See Cassio wipe his beard with.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>If it be that — </li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li class="number">If it be that, or any that was hers,</li>
  <li>It speaks against her with the other proofs.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!</li>
  <li>One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.</li>
  <li>Now do I see 'tis true. Look here, Iago;</li>
  <li class="number">All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.</li>
  <li>'Tis gone.</li>
  <li>Arise, black vengeance, from thy hollow cell!</li>
  <li>Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne</li>
  <li>To tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,</li>
  <li class="number">For 'tis of aspics' tongues!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li>Yet be content.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>O, blood, blood, blood!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li>Patience, I say; your mind perhaps may change.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>Never, Iago: Like to the Pontic sea,</li>
  <li class="number">Whose icy current and compulsive course</li>
  <li>Ne'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on</li>
  <li>To the Propontic and the Hellespont,</li>
  <li>Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace,</li>
  <li>Shall ne'er look back, ne'er ebb to humble love,</li>
  <li class="number">Till that a capable and wide revenge</li>
  <li>Swallow them up. Now, by yond marble heaven,</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Kneels</li>
  <li>In the due reverence of a sacred vow</li>

  <li>This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart:</li>
  <li class="number">Hot, hot, and moist: this hand of yours requires</li>
  <li>A sequester from liberty, fasting and prayer,</li>
  <li>Much castigation, exercise devout;</li>
  <li>For here's a young and sweating devil here,</li>
  <li>That commonly rebels. 'Tis a good hand,</li>
  <li class="number">A frank one.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DESDEMONA</li>
  <li>You may, indeed, say so;</li>
  <li>For 'twas that hand that gave away my heart.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>A liberal hand: the hearts of old gave hands;</li>
  <li>But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.</li>

  <li>No, indeed, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li class="number">That is a fault.</li>
  <li>That handkerchief</li>
  <li>Did an Egyptian to my mother give;</li>
  <li>She was a charmer, and could almost read</li>
  <li>The thoughts of people: she told her, while</li>
  <li class="number">she kept it,</li>
  <li>'Twould make her amiable and subdue my father</li>
  <li>Entirely to her love, but if she lost it</li>
  <li>Or made gift of it, my father's eye</li>
  <li>Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt</li>
  <li class="number">After new fancies: she, dying, gave it me;</li>
  <li>And bid me, when my fate would have me wive,</li>
  <li>To give it her. I did so: and take heed on't;</li>
  <li>Make it a darling like your precious eye;</li>
  <li>To lose't or give't away were such perdition</li>
  <li class="number">As nothing else could match.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DESDEMONA</li>
  <li>Is't possible?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>'Tis true: there's magic in the web of it:</li>
  <li>A sibyl, that had number'd in the world</li>
  <li>The sun to course two hundred compasses,</li>
  <li class="number">In her prophetic fury sew'd the work;</li>
  <li>The worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk;</li>
  <li>And it was dyed in mummy which the skilful</li>
  <li>Conserved of maidens' hearts.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">RODERIGO</li>
  <li>It hath not appeared.</li>

  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li class="number">I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your</li>

  <li>Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed, which I</li>

  <li>purpose, courage and valour, this night show it: if</li>
  <li class="number">thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona,</li>
  <li>take me from this world with treachery and devise</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">RODERIGO</li>
  <li>Well, what is it? is it within reason and compass?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li>Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice</li>
  <li class="number">to depute Cassio in Othello's place.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">RODERIGO</li>
  <li>Is that true? why, then Othello and Desdemona</li>
  <li>return again to Venice.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li>O, no; he goes into Mauritania and takes away with</li>
  <li>him the fair Desdemona, unless his abode be</li>
  <li class="number">lingered here by some accident: wherein none can be</li>
  <li>so determinate as the removing of Cassio.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">RODERIGO</li>
  <li>How do you mean, removing of him?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li>Why, by making him uncapable of Othello's place;</li>
  <li>knocking out his brains.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">RODERIGO</li>
  <li class="number">And that you would have me to do?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li>Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right.</li>
  <li>He sups to-night with a harlotry, and thither will I</li>
  <li>go to him: he knows not yet of his horrorable</li>
  <li>fortune. If you will watch his going thence, which</li>
  <li class="number">I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one,</li>
  <li>you may take him at your pleasure: I will be near</li>
  <li>to second your attempt, and he shall fall between</li>
  <li>us. Come, stand not amazed at it, but go along with</li>
  <li>me; I will show you such a necessity in his death</li>
  <li class="number">that you shall think yourself bound to put it on</li>
  <li>him. It is now high suppertime, and the night grows</li>
  <li>to waste: about it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">RODERIGO</li>
  <li>I will hear further reason for this.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IAGO</li>
  <li>And you shall be satisfied.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EMILIA</li>
  <li>In troth, I think I should; and undo't when I had</li>

  <li class="number">joint-ring, nor for measures of lawn, nor for</li>
  <li>gowns, petticoats, nor caps, nor any petty</li>
  <li>exhibition; but for the whole world —  why, who would</li>
  <li>not make her husband a cuckold to make him a</li>

  <li class="speaker">EMILIA</li>
  <li>Yes, a dozen; and as many to the vantage as would</li>
  <li>store the world they played for.</li>
  <li>But I do think it is their husbands' faults</li>
  <li>If wives do fall: say that they slack their duties,</li>
  <li class="number">And pour our treasures into foreign laps,</li>
  <li>Or else break out in peevish jealousies,</li>
  <li>Throwing restraint upon us; or say they strike us,</li>
  <li>Or scant our former having in despite;</li>
  <li>Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace,</li>
  <li class="number">Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know</li>
  <li>Their wives have sense like them: they see and smell</li>
  <li>And have their palates both for sweet and sour,</li>
  <li>As husbands have. What is it that they do</li>
  <li>When they change us for others? Is it sport?</li>
  <li class="number">I think it is: and doth affection breed it?</li>
  <li>I think it doth: is't frailty that thus errs?</li>
  <li>It is so too: and have not we affections,</li>
  <li>Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?</li>
  <li>Then let them use us well: else let them know,</li>
  <li class="number">The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DESDEMONA</li>
  <li>Good night, good night: heaven me such uses send,</li>
  <li>Not to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend!</li>

<h3>SCENE II.  A bedchamber in the castle: DESDEMONA in bed asleep; a light burning.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter OTHELLO</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul —  </li>
  <li>Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars! — </li>
  <li>It is the cause. Yet I'll not shed her blood;</li>
  <li>Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow,</li>
  <li class="number">And smooth as monumental alabaster.</li>
  <li>Yet she must die, else she'll betray more men.</li>
  <li>Put out the light, and then put out the light:</li>
  <li>If I quench thee, thou flaming minister,</li>
  <li>I can again thy former light restore,</li>
  <li class="number">Should I repent me: but once put out thy light,</li>
  <li>Thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature,</li>
  <li>I know not where is that Promethean heat</li>
  <li>That can thy light relume. When I have pluck'd the rose,</li>
  <li>I cannot give it vital growth again.</li>
  <li class="number">It must needs wither: I'll smell it on the tree.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Kissing her</li>
  <li>Ah balmy breath, that dost almost persuade</li>
  <li>Justice to break her sword! One more, one more.</li>
  <li>Be thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee,</li>
  <li>And love thee after. One more, and this the last:</li>
  <li class="number">So sweet was ne'er so fatal. I must weep,</li>
  <li>But they are cruel tears: this sorrow's heavenly;</li>
  <li>It strikes where it doth love. She wakes.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DESDEMONA</li>
  <li>Who's there? Othello?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>Ay. Desdemona.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DESDEMONA</li>
  <li class="number">Will you come to bed, my lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>Have you pray'd to-night, Desdemona?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DESDEMONA</li>
  <li>Ay, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>If you bethink yourself of any crime</li>
  <li>Unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace,</li>
  <li class="number">Solicit for it straight.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DESDEMONA</li>
  <li>Alas, my lord, what do you mean by that?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>Well, do it, and be brief; I will walk by:</li>
  <li>I would not kill thy unprepared spirit;</li>
  <li>No; heaven forfend! I would not kill thy soul.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DESDEMONA</li>
  <li class="number">Talk you of killing?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>Ay, I do.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DESDEMONA</li>
  <li>Then heaven</li>
  <li>Have mercy on me!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>Amen, with all my heart!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DESDEMONA</li>
  <li class="number">If you say so, I hope you will not kill me.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>Hum!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DESDEMONA</li>
  <li>And yet I fear you; for you are fatal then</li>
  <li>When your eyes roll so: why I should fear I know not,</li>
  <li>Since guiltiness I know not; but yet I feel I fear.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li class="number">Think on thy sins.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DESDEMONA</li>
  <li>They are loves I bear to you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>Ay, and for that thou diest.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DESDEMONA</li>
  <li>That death's unnatural that kills for loving.</li>
  <li>Alas, why gnaw you so your nether lip?</li>
  <li class="number">Some bloody passion shakes your very frame:</li>
  <li>These are portents; but yet I hope, I hope,</li>
  <li>They do not point on me.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>Peace, and be still!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DESDEMONA</li>
  <li>I will so. What's the matter?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li class="number">That handkerchief which I so loved and gave thee</li>
  <li>Thou gavest to Cassio.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DESDEMONA</li>
  <li>No, by my life and soul!</li>
  <li>Send for the man, and ask him.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>Sweet soul, take heed,</li>
  <li class="number">Take heed of perjury; thou art on thy deathbed.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DESDEMONA</li>
  <li>Ay, but not yet to die.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>Yes, presently:</li>
  <li>Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin;</li>
  <li>For to deny each article with oath</li>
  <li class="number">Cannot remove nor choke the strong conception</li>
  <li>That I do groan withal. Thou art to die.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DESDEMONA</li>
  <li>Then Lord have mercy on me!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>I say, amen.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DESDEMONA</li>
  <li>And have you mercy too! I never did</li>
  <li class="number">Offend you in my life; never loved Cassio</li>
  <li>But with such general warranty of heaven</li>
  <li>As I might love: I never gave him token.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>By heaven, I saw my handkerchief in's hand.</li>
  <li>O perjured woman! thou dost stone my heart,</li>
  <li class="number">And makest me call what I intend to do</li>
  <li>A murder, which I thought a sacrifice:</li>
  <li>I saw the handkerchief.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DESDEMONA</li>
  <li>He found it then;</li>
  <li>I never gave it him: send for him hither;</li>
  <li class="number">Let him confess a truth.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>He hath confess'd.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DESDEMONA</li>
  <li>What, my lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>That he hath used thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DESDEMONA</li>
  <li>How? unlawfully?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li class="number">Ay.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DESDEMONA</li>
  <li>He will not say so.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>No, his mouth is stopp'd;</li>
  <li>Honest Iago hath ta'en order for't.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DESDEMONA</li>
  <li>O! my fear interprets: what, is he dead?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li class="number">Had all his hairs been lives, my great revenge</li>
  <li>Had stomach for them all.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DESDEMONA</li>
  <li>Alas! he is betray'd and I undone.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>Out, strumpet! weep'st thou for him to my face?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DESDEMONA</li>
  <li>O, banish me, my lord, but kill me not!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li class="number">Down, strumpet!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DESDEMONA</li>
  <li>Kill me to-morrow: let me live to-night!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>Nay, if you strive — </li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DESDEMONA</li>
  <li>But half an hour!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>Being done, there is no pause.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DESDEMONA</li>
  <li class="number">But while I say one prayer!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>It is too late.</li>

  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>Yes: 'tis Emilia. By and by. She's dead.</li>
  <li class="number">'Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio's death. — </li>
  <li>The noise was here. Ha! no more moving?</li>
  <li>Still as the grave. Shall she come in? were't good? — </li>
  <li>I think she stirs again: — no. What's best to do?</li>
  <li>If she come in, she'll sure speak to my wife:</li>
  <li class="number">My wife! my wife! what wife? I have no wife.</li>
  <li>O insupportable! O heavy hour!</li>
  <li>Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse</li>
  <li>Of sun and moon, and that the affrighted globe</li>
  <li>Should yawn at alteration.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EMILIA</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EMILIA</li>
  <li>But now, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>It is the very error of the moon;</li>
  <li class="number">She comes more nearer earth than she was wont,</li>
  <li>And makes men mad.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EMILIA</li>
  <li>Cassio, my lord, hath kill'd a young Venetian</li>
  <li>Call'd Roderigo.</li>

  <li>No, Cassio is not kill'd.</li>

  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>You heard her say herself, it was not I.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EMILIA</li>
  <li>She said so: I must needs report the truth.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>She's, like a liar, gone to burning hell:</li>
  <li>'Twas I that kill'd her.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EMILIA</li>
  <li class="number">O, the more angel she,</li>
  <li>And you the blacker devil!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>She turn'd to folly, and she was a whore.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EMILIA</li>
  <li>Thou dost belie her, and thou art a devil.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>She was false as water.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EMILIA</li>
  <li class="number">Thou art rash as fire, to say</li>
  <li>That she was false: O, she was heavenly true!</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>Cassio did top her; ask thy husband else.</li>
  <li>O, I were damn'd beneath all depth in hell,</li>
  <li>But that I did proceed upon just grounds</li>
  <li class="number">To this extremity. Thy husband knew it all.</li>

  <li>That she was false to wedlock?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>Ay, with Cassio. Nay, had she been true,</li>
  <li class="number">If heaven would make me such another world</li>
  <li>Of one entire and Perfect chrysolite,</li>
  <li>I'ld not have sold her for it.</li>
</ol>

  <li class="speaker">EMILIA</li>
  <li>My husband!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>Ay, 'twas he that told me first:</li>
  <li class="number">An honest man he is, and hates the slime</li>
  <li>That sticks on filthy deeds.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EMILIA</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EMILIA</li>
  <li>O mistress, villany hath made mocks with love,</li>

  <li>He, woman;</li>
  <li>I say thy husband: dost understand the word?</li>
  <li>My friend, thy husband, honest, honest Iago.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EMILIA</li>
  <li>If he say so, may his pernicious soul</li>
  <li class="number">Rot half a grain a day! he lies to the heart:</li>

  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>Ha!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EMILIA</li>

  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>Peace, you were best.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EMILIA</li>
  <li>Thou hast not half that power to do me harm</li>

  <li>As ignorant as dirt! thou hast done a deed — </li>
  <li class="number">I care not for thy sword; I'll make thee known,</li>
  <li>Though I lost twenty lives. — Help! help, ho! help!</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LODOVICO</li>
  <li>Sir, you shall understand what hath befall'n,</li>
  <li>Which, as I think, you know not. Here is a letter</li>
  <li class="number">Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo;</li>
  <li>And here another: the one of them imports</li>
  <li>The death of Cassio to be undertook</li>
  <li>By Roderigo.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>O villain!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASSIO</li>
  <li class="number">Most heathenish and most gross!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LODOVICO</li>
  <li>Now here's another discontented paper,</li>
  <li>Found in his pocket too; and this, it seems,</li>
  <li>Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain;</li>
  <li>But that belike Iago in the interim</li>
  <li class="number">Came in and satisfied him.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>O the pernicious caitiff!</li>
  <li>How came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief</li>
  <li>That was my wife's?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASSIO</li>
  <li>I found it in my chamber:</li>
  <li class="number">And he himself confess'd but even now</li>
  <li>That there he dropp'd it for a special purpose</li>
  <li>Which wrought to his desire.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>O fool! fool! fool!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASSIO</li>
  <li>There is besides in Roderigo's letter,</li>
  <li class="number">How he upbraids Iago, that he made him</li>
  <li>Brave me upon the watch; whereon it came</li>
  <li>That I was cast: and even but now he spake,</li>
  <li>After long seeming dead, Iago hurt him,</li>
  <li>Iago set him on.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LODOVICO</li>
  <li class="number">You must forsake this room, and go with us:</li>
  <li>Your power and your command is taken off,</li>
  <li>And Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this slave,</li>
  <li>If there be any cunning cruelty</li>
  <li>That can torment him much and hold him long,</li>
  <li class="number">It shall be his. You shall close prisoner rest,</li>
  <li>Till that the nature of your fault be known</li>
  <li>To the Venetian state. Come, bring him away.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>Soft you; a word or two before you go.</li>
  <li>I have done the state some service, and they know't.</li>
  <li class="number">No more of that. I pray you, in your letters,</li>
  <li>When you shall these unlucky deeds relate,</li>
  <li>Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate,</li>
  <li>Nor set down aught in malice: then must you speak</li>
  <li>Of one that loved not wisely but too well;</li>
  <li class="number">Of one not easily jealous, but being wrought</li>
  <li>Perplex'd in the extreme; of one whose hand,</li>
  <li>Like the base Indian, threw a pearl away</li>
  <li>Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdued eyes,</li>
  <li>Albeit unused to the melting mood,</li>
  <li class="number">Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees</li>
  <li>Their medicinal gum. Set you down this;</li>
  <li>And say besides, that in Aleppo once,</li>
  <li>Where a malignant and a turban'd Turk</li>
  <li>Beat a Venetian and traduced the state,</li>
  <li class="number">I took by the throat the circumcised dog,</li>
  <li>And smote him, thus.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Stabs himself</div>

  <li class="speaker">LODOVICO</li>
  <li>O bloody period!</li>

  <li class="speaker">GRATIANO</li>
  <li>All that's spoke is marr'd.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OTHELLO</li>
  <li>I kiss'd thee ere I kill'd thee: no way but this;</li>
  <li class="number">Killing myself, to die upon a kiss.</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Falls on the bed, and dies</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASSIO</li>
  <li>This did I fear, but thought he had no weapon;</li>
  <li>For he was great of heart.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LODOVICO</li>
  <li>To IAGO  O Spartan dog,</li>
  <li>More fell than anguish, hunger, or the sea!</li>
  <li class="number">Look on the tragic loading of this bed;</li>
  <li>This is thy work: the object poisons sight;</li>
  <li>Let it be hid. Gratiano, keep the house,</li>
  <li>And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor,</li>
  <li>For they succeed on you. To you, lord governor,</li>
  <li class="number">Remains the censure of this hellish villain;</li>
  <li>The time, the place, the torture: O, enforce it!</li>
  <li>Myself will straight aboard: and to the state</li>
  <li>This heavy act with heavy heart relate.</li>
