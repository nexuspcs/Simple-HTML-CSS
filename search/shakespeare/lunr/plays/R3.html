<h3>SCENE I.  London. A street.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter GLOUCESTER, solus</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>Now is the winter of our discontent</li>
  <li>Made glorious summer by this sun of York;</li>
  <li>And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house</li>
  <li>In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.</li>
  <li class="number">Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;</li>
  <li>Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;</li>
  <li>Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,</li>
  <li>Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.</li>
  <li>Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;</li>
  <li class="number">And now, instead of mounting barded steeds</li>
  <li>To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,</li>
  <li>He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber</li>
  <li>To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.</li>
  <li>But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,</li>
  <li class="number">Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;</li>
  <li>I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty</li>
  <li>To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;</li>
  <li>I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,</li>
  <li>Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,</li>
  <li class="number">Deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time</li>
  <li>Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,</li>
  <li>And that so lamely and unfashionable</li>
  <li>That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;</li>
  <li>Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,</li>
  <li class="number">Have no delight to pass away the time,</li>
  <li>Unless to spy my shadow in the sun</li>
  <li>And descant on mine own deformity:</li>
  <li>And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,</li>
  <li>To entertain these fair well-spoken days,</li>
  <li class="number">I am determined to prove a villain</li>
  <li>And hate the idle pleasures of these days.</li>
  <li>Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,</li>
  <li>By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,</li>
  <li>To set my brother Clarence and the king</li>
  <li class="number">In deadly hate the one against the other:</li>
  <li>And if King Edward be as true and just</li>
  <li>As I am subtle, false and treacherous,</li>
  <li>This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up,</li>
  <li>About a prophecy, which says that 'G'</li>
  <li class="number">Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.</li>
  <li>Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here</li>
  <li>Clarence comes.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Enter CLARENCE, guarded, and BRAKENBURY</li>
  <li>Brother, good day; what means this armed guard</li>
  <li>That waits upon your grace?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CLARENCE</li>
  <li class="number">His majesty</li>
  <li>Tendering my person's safety, hath appointed</li>
  <li>This conduct to convey me to the Tower.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>Upon what cause?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CLARENCE</li>
  <li>Because my name is George.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li class="number">Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours;</li>
  <li>He should, for that, commit your godfathers:</li>
  <li>O, belike his majesty hath some intent</li>
  <li>That you shall be new-christen'd in the Tower.</li>
  <li>But what's the matter, Clarence?  may I know?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CLARENCE</li>
  <li class="number">Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest</li>
  <li>As yet I do not: but, as I can learn,</li>
  <li>He hearkens after prophecies and dreams;</li>
  <li>And from the cross-row plucks the letter G.</li>
  <li>And says a wizard told him that by G</li>
  <li class="number">His issue disinherited should be;</li>
  <li>And, for my name of George begins with G,</li>
  <li>It follows in his thought that I am he.</li>
  <li>These, as I learn, and such like toys as these</li>
  <li>Have moved his highness to commit me now.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li class="number">Why, this it is, when men are ruled by women:</li>
  <li>'Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower:</li>
  <li>My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, 'tis she</li>
  <li>That tempers him to this extremity.</li>
  <li>Was it not she and that good man of worship,</li>
  <li class="number">Anthony Woodville, her brother there,</li>
  <li>That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,</li>
  <li>From whence this present day he is deliver'd?</li>
  <li>We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CLARENCE</li>
  <li>By heaven, I think there's no man is secure</li>
  <li class="number">But the queen's kindred and night-walking heralds</li>
  <li>That trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore.</li>
  <li>Heard ye not what an humble suppliant</li>
  <li>Lord hastings was to her for his delivery?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>Humbly complaining to her deity</li>
  <li class="number">Got my lord chamberlain his liberty.</li>
  <li>I'll tell you what; I think it is our way,</li>
  <li>If we will keep in favour with the king,</li>
  <li>To be her men and wear her livery:</li>
  <li>The jealous o'erworn widow and herself,</li>
  <li class="number">Since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen.</li>
  <li>Are mighty gossips in this monarchy.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRAKENBURY</li>
  <li>I beseech your graces both to pardon me;</li>
  <li>His majesty hath straitly given in charge</li>
  <li>That no man shall have private conference,</li>
  <li class="number">Of what degree soever, with his brother.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>Even so; an't please your worship, Brakenbury,</li>
  <li>You may partake of any thing we say:</li>
  <li>We speak no treason, man: we say the king</li>
  <li>Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen</li>
  <li class="number">Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous;</li>
  <li>We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot,</li>
  <li>A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;</li>
  <li>And that the queen's kindred are made gentle-folks:</li>
  <li>How say you sir? Can you deny all this?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRAKENBURY</li>
  <li class="number">With this, my lord, myself have nought to do.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>Naught to do with mistress Shore! I tell thee, fellow,</li>
  <li>He that doth naught with her, excepting one,</li>
  <li>Were best he do it secretly, alone.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRAKENBURY</li>
  <li>What one, my lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li class="number">Her husband, knave: wouldst thou betray me?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRAKENBURY</li>
  <li>I beseech your grace to pardon me, and withal</li>
  <li>Forbear your conference with the noble duke.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CLARENCE</li>
  <li>We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>We are the queen's abjects, and must obey.</li>
  <li class="number">Brother, farewell: I will unto the king;</li>
  <li>And whatsoever you will employ me in,</li>
  <li>Were it to call King Edward's widow sister,</li>
  <li>I will perform it to enfranchise you.</li>
  <li>Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood</li>
  <li class="number">Touches me deeper than you can imagine.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CLARENCE</li>
  <li>I know it pleaseth neither of us well.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>Well, your imprisonment shall not be long;</li>
  <li>Meantime, have patience.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CLARENCE</li>
  <li>I must perforce. Farewell.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt CLARENCE, BRAKENBURY, and Guard</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li class="number">Go, tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.</li>
  <li>Simple, plain Clarence! I do love thee so,</li>
  <li>That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,</li>
  <li>If heaven will take the present at our hands.</li>
  <li>But who comes here? the new-deliver'd Hastings?</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter HASTINGS</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HASTINGS</li>
  <li class="number">Good time of day unto my gracious lord!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>As much unto my good lord chamberlain!</li>
  <li>Well are you welcome to the open air.</li>
  <li>How hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HASTINGS</li>
  <li>With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must:</li>
  <li class="number">But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks</li>
  <li>That were the cause of my imprisonment.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too;</li>
  <li>For they that were your enemies are his,</li>
  <li>And have prevail'd as much on him as you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HASTINGS</li>
  <li class="number">More pity that the eagle should be mew'd,</li>
  <li>While kites and buzzards prey at liberty.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>What news abroad?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HASTINGS</li>
  <li>No news so bad abroad as this at home;</li>
  <li>The King is sickly, weak and melancholy,</li>
  <li class="number">And his physicians fear him mightily.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>Now, by Saint Paul, this news is bad indeed.</li>
  <li>O, he hath kept an evil diet long,</li>
  <li>And overmuch consumed his royal person:</li>
  <li>'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.</li>
  <li class="number">What, is he in his bed?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HASTINGS</li>
  <li>He is.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>Go you before, and I will follow you.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Exit HASTINGS</li>
  <li>He cannot live, I hope; and must not die</li>
  <li>Till George be pack'd with post-horse up to heaven.</li>
  <li class="number">I'll in, to urge his hatred more to Clarence,</li>
  <li>With lies well steel'd with weighty arguments;</li>
  <li>And, if I fall not in my deep intent,</li>
  <li>Clarence hath not another day to live:</li>
  <li>Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy,</li>
  <li class="number">And leave the world for me to bustle in!</li>
  <li>For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter.</li>
  <li>What though I kill'd her husband and her father?</li>
  <li>The readiest way to make the wench amends</li>
  <li>Is to become her husband and her father:</li>
  <li class="number">The which will I; not all so much for love</li>
  <li>As for another secret close intent,</li>
  <li>By marrying her which I must reach unto.</li>
  <li>But yet I run before my horse to market:</li>
  <li>Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:</li>
  <li class="number">When they are gone, then must I count my gains.</li>

<h3>SCENE II.  The same. Another street.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter the corpse of KING HENRY the Sixth, Gentlemen
with halberds to guard it; LADY ANNE being the mourner</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LADY ANNE</li>
  <li>Set down, set down your honourable load,</li>
  <li>If honour may be shrouded in a hearse,</li>
  <li>Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament</li>
  <li>The untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.</li>
  <li class="number">Poor key-cold figure of a holy king!</li>
  <li>Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster!</li>
  <li>Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood!</li>
  <li>Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost,</li>
  <li>To hear the lamentations of Poor Anne,</li>
  <li class="number">Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughter'd son,</li>
  <li>Stabb'd by the selfsame hand that made these wounds!</li>
  <li>Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life,</li>
  <li>I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.</li>
  <li>Cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes!</li>
  <li class="number">Cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it!</li>
  <li>Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence!</li>
  <li>More direful hap betide that hated wretch,</li>
  <li>That makes us wretched by the death of thee,</li>
  <li>Than I can wish to adders, spiders, toads,</li>
  <li class="number">Or any creeping venom'd thing that lives!</li>
  <li>If ever he have child, abortive be it,</li>
  <li>Prodigious, and untimely brought to light,</li>
  <li>Whose ugly and unnatural aspect</li>
  <li>May fright the hopeful mother at the view;</li>
  <li class="number">And that be heir to his unhappiness!</li>
  <li>If ever he have wife, let her he made</li>
  <li>A miserable by the death of him</li>
  <li>As I am made by my poor lord and thee!</li>
  <li>Come, now towards Chertsey with your holy load,</li>
  <li class="number">Taken from Paul's to be interred there;</li>
  <li>And still, as you are weary of the weight,</li>
  <li>Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry's corse.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter GLOUCESTER</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LADY ANNE</li>
  <li>What black magician conjures up this fiend,</li>
  <li class="number">To stop devoted charitable deeds?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,</li>
  <li>I'll make a corse of him that disobeys.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Gentleman</li>
  <li>My lord, stand back, and let the coffin pass.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>Unmanner'd dog! stand thou, when I command:</li>
  <li class="number">Advance thy halbert higher than my breast,</li>
  <li>Or, by Saint Paul, I'll strike thee to my foot,</li>
  <li>And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LADY ANNE</li>
  <li>What, do you tremble? are you all afraid?</li>
  <li>Alas, I blame you not; for you are mortal,</li>
  <li class="number">And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil.</li>
  <li>Avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hell!</li>
  <li>Thou hadst but power over his mortal body,</li>
  <li>His soul thou canst not have; therefore be gone.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LADY ANNE</li>
  <li class="number">Foul devil, for God's sake, hence, and trouble us not;</li>
  <li>For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell,</li>
  <li>Fill'd it with cursing cries and deep exclaims.</li>
  <li>If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,</li>
  <li>Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.</li>
  <li class="number">O, gentlemen, see, see! dead Henry's wounds</li>
  <li>Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh!</li>
  <li>Blush, Blush, thou lump of foul deformity;</li>
  <li>For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood</li>
  <li>From cold and empty veins, where no blood dwells;</li>
  <li class="number">Thy deed, inhuman and unnatural,</li>
  <li>Provokes this deluge most unnatural.</li>
  <li>O God, which this blood madest, revenge his death!</li>
  <li>O earth, which this blood drink'st revenge his death!</li>
  <li>Either heaven with lightning strike the</li>
  <li class="number">murderer dead,</li>
  <li>Or earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,</li>
  <li>As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood</li>
  <li>Which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>Lady, you know no rules of charity,</li>
  <li class="number">Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LADY ANNE</li>
  <li>Villain, thou know'st no law of God nor man:</li>
  <li>No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>But I know none, and therefore am no beast.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LADY ANNE</li>
  <li>O wonderful, when devils tell the truth!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li class="number">More wonderful, when angels are so angry.</li>
  <li>Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,</li>
  <li>Of these supposed-evils, to give me leave,</li>
  <li>By circumstance, but to acquit myself.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LADY ANNE</li>
  <li>Vouchsafe, defused infection of a man,</li>
  <li class="number">For these known evils, but to give me leave,</li>
  <li>By circumstance, to curse thy cursed self.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have</li>
  <li>Some patient leisure to excuse myself.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LADY ANNE</li>
  <li>Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make</li>
  <li class="number">No excuse current, but to hang thyself.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>By such despair, I should accuse myself.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LADY ANNE</li>
  <li>And, by despairing, shouldst thou stand excused;</li>
  <li>For doing worthy vengeance on thyself,</li>
  <li>Which didst unworthy slaughter upon others.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li class="number">Say that I slew them not?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LADY ANNE</li>
  <li>Why, then they are not dead:</li>
  <li>But dead they are, and devilish slave, by thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>I did not kill your husband.</li>

<ol class="speech">

  <li>Why, then he is alive.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li class="number">Nay, he is dead; and slain by Edward's hand.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LADY ANNE</li>
  <li>In thy foul throat thou liest: Queen Margaret saw</li>
  <li>Thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood;</li>
  <li>The which thou once didst bend against her breast,</li>
  <li>But that thy brothers beat aside the point.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li class="number">I was provoked by her slanderous tongue,</li>
  <li>which laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LADY ANNE</li>
  <li>Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind.</li>
  <li>Which never dreamt on aught but butcheries:</li>
  <li>Didst thou not kill this king?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li class="number">I grant ye.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LADY ANNE</li>
  <li>Dost grant me, hedgehog? then, God grant me too</li>
  <li>Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed!</li>
  <li>O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>The fitter for the King of heaven, that hath him.</li>

  <li class="speaker">LADY ANNE</li>
  <li>And thou unfit for any place but hell.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LADY ANNE</li>

  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>Your bed-chamber.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LADY ANNE</li>
  <li>I'll rest betide the chamber where thou liest!</li>

  <li>So will it, madam till I lie with you.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LADY ANNE</li>
  <li>I hope so.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li class="number">I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,</li>
  <li>To leave this keen encounter of our wits,</li>
  <li>And fall somewhat into a slower method,</li>
  <li>Is not the causer of the timeless deaths</li>
  <li>Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,</li>
  <li class="number">As blameful as the executioner?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LADY ANNE</li>
  <li>Thou art the cause, and most accursed effect.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>Your beauty was the cause of that effect;</li>
  <li>Your beauty: which did haunt me in my sleep</li>
  <li>To undertake the death of all the world,</li>
  <li class="number">So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LADY ANNE</li>
  <li>If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,</li>
  <li>These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>These eyes could never endure sweet beauty's wreck;</li>
  <li>You should not blemish it, if I stood by:</li>
  <li class="number">As all the world is cheered by the sun,</li>
  <li>So I by that; it is my day, my life.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LADY ANNE</li>
  <li>Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life!</li>

<ol class="speech">

  <li>Curse not thyself, fair creature thou art both.</li>

  <li>I would I were, to be revenged on thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li class="number">It is a quarrel most unnatural,</li>
  <li>To be revenged on him that loveth you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LADY ANNE</li>
  <li>It is a quarrel just and reasonable,</li>
  <li>To be revenged on him that slew my husband.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband,</li>
  <li class="number">Did it to help thee to a better husband.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LADY ANNE</li>
  <li>His better doth not breathe upon the earth.</li>

  <li>He lives that loves thee better than he could.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LADY ANNE</li>
  <li>Name him.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>Plantagenet.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>The selfsame name, but one of better nature.</li>

<ol class="speech">

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>Here.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">She spitteth at him</li>
  <li>Why dost thou spit at me?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LADY ANNE</li>
  <li class="number">Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>Never came poison from so sweet a place.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LADY ANNE</li>
  <li>Never hung poison on a fouler toad.</li>
  <li>Out of my sight! thou dost infect my eyes.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LADY ANNE</li>
  <li class="number">Would they were basilisks, to strike thee dead!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>I would they were, that I might die at once;</li>
  <li>For now they kill me with a living death.</li>
  <li>Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,</li>
  <li>Shamed their aspect with store of childish drops:</li>
  <li class="number">These eyes that never shed remorseful tear,</li>
  <li>No, when my father York and Edward wept,</li>
  <li>To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made</li>
  <li>When black-faced Clifford shook his sword at him;</li>
  <li>Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,</li>
  <li class="number">Told the sad story of my father's death,</li>
  <li>And twenty times made pause to sob and weep,</li>
  <li>That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks</li>
  <li>Like trees bedash'd with rain: in that sad time</li>
  <li>My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;</li>
  <li class="number">And what these sorrows could not thence exhale,</li>
  <li>Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping.</li>
  <li>I never sued to friend nor enemy;</li>
  <li>My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word;</li>
  <li>But now thy beauty is proposed my fee,</li>
  <li class="number">My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">She looks scornfully at him</li>
  <li>Teach not thy lips such scorn, for they were made</li>
  <li>For kissing, lady, not for such contempt.</li>
  <li>If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,</li>
  <li>Lo, here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword;</li>
  <li class="number">Which if thou please to hide in this true bosom.</li>
  <li>And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,</li>
  <li>I lay it naked to the deadly stroke,</li>
  <li>And humbly beg the death upon my knee.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">He lays his breast open: she offers at it with his sword</li>
  <li>Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry,</li>
  <li class="number">But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me.</li>
  <li>Nay, now dispatch; 'twas I that stabb'd young Edward,</li>
  <li>But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Here she lets fall the sword</li>
  <li>Take up the sword again, or take up me.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LADY ANNE</li>
  <li>Arise, dissembler: though I wish thy death,</li>
  <li class="number">I will not be the executioner.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LADY ANNE</li>
  <li>I have already.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>Tush, that was in thy rage:</li>
  <li>Speak it again, and, even with the word,</li>
  <li class="number">That hand, which, for thy love, did kill thy love,</li>
  <li>Shall, for thy love, kill a far truer love;</li>
  <li>To both their deaths thou shalt be accessary.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LADY ANNE</li>
  <li>I would I knew thy heart.</li>

  <li class="speaker">LADY ANNE</li>
  <li>Well, well, put up your sword.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>Say, then, my peace is made.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LADY ANNE</li>
  <li>That shall you know hereafter.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li class="number">But shall I live in hope?</li>

<ol class="speech">

  <li>All men, I hope, live so.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>Vouchsafe to wear this ring.</li>

  <li>Look, how this ring encompasseth finger.</li>

  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>

  <li>The spacious world cannot again afford</li>

  <li>Why looks your grace so heavily today?</li>

  <li>So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,</li>
  <li>That, as I am a Christian faithful man,</li>
  <li class="number">I would not spend another such a night,</li>
  <li>Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days,</li>
  <li>So full of dismal terror was the time!</li>

  <li>What was your dream? I long to hear you tell it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CLARENCE</li>
  <li>Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower,</li>
  <li class="number">And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy;</li>
  <li>And, in my company, my brother Gloucester;</li>
  <li>Who from my cabin tempted me to walk</li>
  <li>Upon the hatches: thence we looked toward England,</li>
  <li>And cited up a thousand fearful times,</li>
  <li class="number">During the wars of York and Lancaster</li>
  <li>That had befall'n us. As we paced along</li>
  <li>Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,</li>
  <li>Methought that Gloucester stumbled; and, in falling,</li>
  <li>Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard,</li>
  <li class="number">Into the tumbling billows of the main.</li>
  <li>Lord, Lord! methought, what pain it was to drown!</li>
  <li>What dreadful noise of waters in mine ears!</li>

  <li>Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;</li>
  <li class="number">Ten thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon;</li>
  <li>Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,</li>
  <li>Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,</li>
  <li>All scatter'd in the bottom of the sea:</li>
  <li>Some lay in dead men's skulls; and, in those holes</li>
  <li class="number">Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept,</li>
  <li>As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,</li>
  <li>Which woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep,</li>

  <li>To seek the empty, vast and wandering air;</li>
  <li class="number">But smother'd it within my panting bulk,</li>
  <li>Which almost burst to belch it in the sea.</li>

  <li>With that grim ferryman which poets write of,</li>
  <li>Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.</li>
  <li>The first that there did greet my stranger soul,</li>
  <li>Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick;</li>
  <li class="number">Who cried aloud, 'What scourge for perjury</li>
  <li>Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?'</li>
  <li>And so he vanish'd: then came wandering by</li>
  <li>A shadow like an angel, with bright hair</li>
  <li>Dabbled in blood; and he squeak'd out aloud,</li>
  <li class="number">'Clarence is come; false, fleeting, perjured Clarence,</li>
  <li>That stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury;</li>
  <li>Seize on him, Furies, take him to your torments!'</li>
  <li>With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends</li>
  <li>Environ'd me about, and howled in mine ears</li>
  <li class="number">Such hideous cries, that with the very noise</li>
  <li>I trembling waked, and for a season after</li>
  <li>Could not believe but that I was in hell,</li>
  <li>Such terrible impression made the dream.</li>

  <li class="speaker">CLARENCE</li>
  <li>O Brakenbury, I have done those things,</li>
  <li>Which now bear evidence against my soul,</li>
  <li>For Edward's sake; and see how he requites me!</li>
  <li>O God! if my deep prayers cannot appease thee,</li>
  <li class="number">But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,</li>
  <li>Yet execute thy wrath in me alone,</li>
  <li>O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!</li>
  <li>I pray thee, gentle keeper, stay by me;</li>
  <li>My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRAKENBURY</li>

  <li class="stage-direction">CLARENCE sleeps</li>
  <li>Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,</li>
  <li>Makes the night morning, and the noon-tide night.</li>
  <li>Princes have but their tides for their glories,</li>
  <li>An outward honour for an inward toil;</li>
  <li class="number">And, for unfelt imagination,</li>
  <li>They often feel a world of restless cares:</li>
  <li>So that, betwixt their tides and low names,</li>
  <li>There's nothing differs but the outward fame.</li>

  <li class="number">In God's name what are you, and how came you hither?</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Murderer</li>
  <li>I would speak with Clarence, and I came hither on my legs.</li>

  <li class="speaker">BRAKENBURY</li>
  <li>Yea, are you so brief?</li>

<div class="stage-direction">BRAKENBURY reads it</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRAKENBURY</li>
  <li class="number">I am, in this, commanded to deliver</li>
  <li>The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands:</li>
  <li>I will not reason what is meant hereby,</li>
  <li>Because I will be guiltless of the meaning.</li>
  <li>Here are the keys, there sits the duke asleep:</li>
  <li class="number">I'll to the king; and signify to him</li>

  <li class="speaker">Second Murderer</li>
  <li>What, shall we stab him as he sleeps?</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Murderer</li>
  <li>No; then he will say 'twas done cowardly, when he wakes.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Murderer</li>

  <li>Why, then he will say we stabbed him sleeping.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Murderer</li>
  <li>The urging of that word 'judgment' hath bred a kind</li>
  <li>of remorse in me.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Murderer</li>
  <li class="number">What, art thou afraid?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Murderer</li>
  <li>Not to kill him, having a warrant for it; but to be</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Murderer</li>
  <li>I thought thou hadst been resolute.</li>

<ol class="speech">

  <li class="speaker">Second Murderer</li>
  <li class="number">In the Duke of Gloucester's purse.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Murderer</li>
  <li>Let it go; there's few or none will entertain it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Murderer</li>
  <li>How if it come to thee again?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Murderer</li>
  <li class="number">I'll not meddle with it: it is a dangerous thing: it</li>
  <li>makes a man a coward: a man cannot steal, but it</li>
  <li>accuseth him; he cannot swear, but it cheques him;</li>
  <li>he cannot lie with his neighbour's wife, but it</li>
  <li>detects him: 'tis a blushing shamefast spirit that</li>
  <li class="number">mutinies in a man's bosom; it fills one full of</li>
  <li>obstacles: it made me once restore a purse of gold</li>
  <li>that I found; it beggars any man that keeps it: it</li>
  <li>is turned out of all towns and cities for a</li>
  <li>dangerous thing; and every man that means to live</li>
  <li class="number">well endeavours to trust to himself and to live</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Murderer</li>
  <li>'Zounds, it is even now at my elbow, persuading me</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Murderer</li>
  <li>Take the devil in thy mind, and relieve him not: he</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Murderer</li>
  <li>Tut, I am strong-framed, he cannot prevail with me,</li>

  <li class="speaker">First Murderer</li>

  <li>Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.</li>

  <li>The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death?</li>
  <li>Before I be convict by course of law,</li>

  <li>I charge you, as you hope to have redemption</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Murderer</li>
  <li>And that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee,</li>
  <li>For false forswearing and for murder too:</li>

  <li>To fight in quarrel of the house of Lancaster.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Murderer</li>
  <li class="number">And, like a traitor to the name of God,</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CLARENCE</li>
  <li>Alas! for whose sake did I that ill deed?</li>

  <li>For in this sin he is as deep as I.</li>
  <li class="number">If God will be revenged for this deed.</li>
  <li>O, know you yet, he doth it publicly,</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CLARENCE</li>
  <li>It cannot be; for when I parted with him,</li>

  <li>That he would labour my delivery.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Murderer</li>
  <li>Why, so he doth, now he delivers thee</li>
  <li class="number">From this world's thraldom to the joys of heaven.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Murderer</li>
  <li>Make peace with God, for you must die, my lord.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DUCHESS OF YORK</li>
  <li>No, boy.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Boy</li>
  <li>Why do you wring your hands, and beat your breast,</li>
  <li>And cry 'O Clarence, my unhappy son!'</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Girl</li>
  <li class="number">Why do you look on us, and shake your head,</li>

  <li>If that our noble father be alive?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DUCHESS OF YORK</li>
  <li>My pretty cousins, you mistake me much;</li>
  <li>I do lament the sickness of the king.</li>
  <li class="number">As loath to lose him, not your father's death;</li>
  <li>It were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Boy</li>
  <li>Then, grandam, you conclude that he is dead.</li>
  <li>The king my uncle is to blame for this:</li>
  <li>God will revenge it; whom I will importune</li>
  <li class="number">With daily prayers all to that effect.</li>

  <li>Peace, children, peace! the king doth love you well:</li>
  <li>Incapable and shallow innocents,</li>
  <li>You cannot guess who caused your father's death.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Boy</li>
  <li class="number">Grandam, we can; for my good uncle Gloucester</li>
  <li>Told me, the king, provoked by the queen,</li>
  <li>Devised impeachments to imprison him :</li>
  <li>And when my uncle told me so, he wept,</li>
  <li>And hugg'd me in his arm, and kindly kiss'd my cheek;</li>
  <li class="number">Bade me rely on him as on my father,</li>
  <li>And he would love me dearly as his child.</li>

  <li class="number">Thou art a widow; yet thou art a mother,</li>
  <li>And hast the comfort of thy children left thee:</li>
  <li>But death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms,</li>
  <li>And pluck'd two crutches from my feeble limbs,</li>
  <li>Edward and Clarence. O, what cause have I,</li>
  <li class="number">Thine being but a moiety of my grief,</li>
  <li>To overgo thy plaints and drown thy cries!</li>

  <li>By how much the estate is green and yet ungovern'd:</li>

<h3>SCENE IV.  London. The palace.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, young YORK, QUEEN
ELIZABETH, and the DUCHESS OF YORK</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</li>
  <li>Last night, I hear, they lay at Northampton;</li>
  <li>At Stony-Stratford will they be to-night:</li>
  <li>To-morrow, or next day, they will be here.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DUCHESS OF YORK</li>
  <li>I long with all my heart to see the prince:</li>
  <li class="number">I hope he is much grown since last I saw him.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</li>
  <li>But I hear, no; they say my son of York</li>
  <li>Hath almost overta'en him in his growth.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">YORK</li>
  <li>Ay, mother; but I would not have it so.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DUCHESS OF YORK</li>
  <li>Why, my young cousin, it is good to grow.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">YORK</li>
  <li class="number">Grandam, one night, as we did sit at supper,</li>
  <li>My uncle Rivers talk'd how I did grow</li>
  <li>More than my brother: 'Ay,' quoth my uncle</li>
  <li>Gloucester,</li>
  <li>'Small herbs have grace, great weeds do grow apace:'</li>
  <li class="number">And since, methinks, I would not grow so fast,</li>
  <li>Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DUCHESS OF YORK</li>
  <li>Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold</li>
  <li>In him that did object the same to thee;</li>
  <li>He was the wretched'st thing when he was young,</li>
  <li class="number">So long a-growing and so leisurely,</li>
  <li>That, if this rule were true, he should be gracious.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</li>
  <li>Why, madam, so, no doubt, he is.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DUCHESS OF YORK</li>
  <li>I hope he is; but yet let mothers doubt.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">YORK</li>
  <li>Now, by my troth, if I had been remember'd,</li>
  <li class="number">I could have given my uncle's grace a flout,</li>
  <li>To touch his growth nearer than he touch'd mine.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DUCHESS OF YORK</li>
  <li>How, my pretty York? I pray thee, let me hear it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">YORK</li>
  <li>Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast</li>
  <li>That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old</li>
  <li class="number">'Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth.</li>
  <li>Grandam, this would have been a biting jest.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DUCHESS OF YORK</li>
  <li>I pray thee, pretty York, who told thee this?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">YORK</li>
  <li>Grandam, his nurse.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DUCHESS OF YORK</li>
  <li>His nurse! why, she was dead ere thou wert born.</li>
</ol>

  <li class="speaker">YORK</li>
  <li class="number">If 'twere not she, I cannot tell who told me.</li>

  <li class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</li>
  <li>A parlous boy: go to, you are too shrewd.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</li>
  <li>Good madam, be not angry with the child.</li>

  <li>Why or for what these nobles were committed</li>

  <li class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</li>
  <li>Ay me, I see the downfall of our house!</li>
  <li>The tiger now hath seized the gentle hind;</li>
  <li class="number">Insulting tyranny begins to jet</li>
  <li>Upon the innocent and aweless throne:</li>
  <li>Welcome, destruction, death, and massacre!</li>
  <li>I see, as in a map, the end of all.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DUCHESS OF YORK</li>
  <li>Accursed and unquiet wrangling days,</li>
  <li class="number">How many of you have mine eyes beheld!</li>
  <li>My husband lost his life to get the crown;</li>
  <li>And often up and down my sons were toss'd,</li>
  <li>For me to joy and weep their gain and loss:</li>
  <li>And being seated, and domestic broils</li>
  <li class="number">Clean over-blown, themselves, the conquerors.</li>
  <li>Make war upon themselves; blood against blood,</li>
  <li>Self against self: O, preposterous</li>
  <li>And frantic outrage, end thy damned spleen;</li>
  <li>Or let me die, to look on death no more!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</li>
  <li class="number">Come, come, my boy; we will to sanctuary.</li>
  <li>Madam, farewell.</li>

<h3>SCENE I.  London. A street.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">The trumpets sound. Enter the young PRINCE EDWARD,
GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM, CARDINAL, CATESBY, and others</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</li>
  <li>Welcome, sweet prince, to London, to your chamber.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts' sovereign</li>
  <li>The weary way hath made you melancholy.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE EDWARD</li>
  <li>No, uncle; but our crosses on the way</li>
  <li class="number">Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy</li>
  <li>I want more uncles here to welcome me.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>Sweet prince, the untainted virtue of your years</li>
  <li>Hath not yet dived into the world's deceit</li>
  <li>Nor more can you distinguish of a man</li>
  <li class="number">Than of his outward show; which, God he knows,</li>
  <li>Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart.</li>
  <li>Those uncles which you want were dangerous;</li>
  <li>Your grace attended to their sugar'd words,</li>
  <li>But look'd not on the poison of their hearts :</li>
  <li class="number">God keep you from them, and from such false friends!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE EDWARD</li>
  <li>God keep me from false friends! but they were none.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>My lord, the mayor of London comes to greet you.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter the Lord Mayor and his train</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Lord Mayor</li>
  <li>God bless your grace with health and happy days!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE EDWARD</li>
  <li>I thank you, good my lord; and thank you all.</li>
  <li class="number">I thought my mother, and my brother York,</li>
  <li>Would long ere this have met us on the way</li>
  <li>Fie, what a slug is Hastings, that he comes not</li>
  <li>To tell us whether they will come or no!</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter HASTINGS</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</li>
  <li>And, in good time, here comes the sweating lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE EDWARD</li>
  <li class="number">Welcome, my lord: what, will our mother come?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HASTINGS</li>
  <li>On what occasion, God he knows, not I,</li>
  <li>The queen your mother, and your brother York,</li>
  <li>Have taken sanctuary: the tender prince</li>
  <li>Would fain have come with me to meet your grace,</li>
  <li class="number">But by his mother was perforce withheld.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</li>
  <li>Fie, what an indirect and peevish course</li>
  <li>Is this of hers! Lord cardinal, will your grace</li>
  <li>Persuade the queen to send the Duke of York</li>
  <li>Unto his princely brother presently?</li>
  <li class="number">If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him,</li>
  <li>And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CARDINAL</li>
  <li>My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory</li>
  <li>Can from his mother win the Duke of York,</li>
  <li>Anon expect him here; but if she be obdurate</li>
  <li class="number">To mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid</li>
  <li>We should infringe the holy privilege</li>
  <li>Of blessed sanctuary! not for all this land</li>
  <li>Would I be guilty of so deep a sin.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</li>
  <li>You are too senseless â€” obstinate, my lord,</li>
  <li class="number">Too ceremonious and traditional</li>
  <li>Weigh it but with the grossness of this age,</li>
  <li>You break not sanctuary in seizing him.</li>
  <li>The benefit thereof is always granted</li>
  <li>To those whose dealings have deserved the place,</li>
  <li class="number">And those who have the wit to claim the place:</li>
  <li>This prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserved it;</li>
  <li>And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it:</li>
  <li>Then, taking him from thence that is not there,</li>
  <li>You break no privilege nor charter there.</li>
  <li class="number">Oft have I heard of sanctuary men;</li>
  <li>But sanctuary children ne'er till now.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CARDINAL</li>
  <li>My lord, you shall o'er-rule my mind for once.</li>
  <li>Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me?</li>
</ol>

  <li class="speaker">HASTINGS</li>
  <li>I go, my lord.</li>

  <li>Where shall we sojourn till our coronation?</li>
</ol>

  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>Where it seems best unto your royal self.</li>
  <li>If I may counsel you, some day or two</li>
  <li class="number">Your highness shall repose you at the Tower:</li>
  <li>Then where you please, and shall be thought most fit</li>
  <li>For your best health and recreation.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE EDWARD</li>
  <li>I do not like the Tower, of any place.</li>
  <li>Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</li>
  <li class="number">He did, my gracious lord, begin that place;</li>
  <li>Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE EDWARD</li>

  <li>Upon record, my gracious lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE EDWARD</li>

  <li>Methinks the truth should live from age to age,</li>

  <li>I say, without characters, fame lives long.</li>

  <li>With what his valour did enrich his wit,</li>

  <li class="number">I'll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham â€”  </li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">YORK</li>
  <li>I thank you, gentle uncle. O, my lord,</li>
  <li>You said that idle weeds are fast in growth</li>
  <li class="number">The prince my brother hath outgrown me far.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>He hath, my lord.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>O, my fair cousin, I must not say so.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">

  <li class="speaker">YORK</li>
  <li class="number">You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me:</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Messenger</li>
  <li>So it should seem by that I have to say.</li>
  <li>First, he commends him to your noble lordship.</li>

  <li class="speaker">HASTINGS</li>
  <li>And then?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Messenger</li>
  <li class="number">And then he sends you word</li>
  <li>He dreamt to-night the boar had razed his helm:</li>
  <li>Besides, he says there are two councils held;</li>
  <li>And that may be determined at the one</li>
  <li>which may make you and him to rue at the other.</li>
  <li class="number">Therefore he sends to know your lordship's pleasure,</li>
  <li>If presently you will take horse with him,</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HASTINGS</li>
  <li>Go, fellow, go, return unto thy lord;</li>
  <li class="number">Bid him not fear the separated councils</li>
  <li>His honour and myself are at the one,</li>
  <li>And at the other is my servant Catesby</li>
  <li>Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us</li>
  <li>Whereof I shall not have intelligence.</li>
  <li class="number">Tell him his fears are shallow, wanting instance:</li>
  <li>And for his dreams, I wonder he is so fond</li>
  <li>To trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers</li>
  <li>To fly the boar before the boar pursues,</li>
  <li>Were to incense the boar to follow us</li>
  <li class="number">And make pursuit where he did mean no chase.</li>
  <li>Go, bid thy master rise and come to me</li>
  <li>And we will both together to the Tower,</li>

  <li>Ay, my good lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HASTINGS</li>
  <li>I'll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CATESBY</li>
  <li>Ay, on my life; and hopes to find forward</li>
  <li>Upon his party for the gain thereof:</li>
  <li>And thereupon he sends you this good news,</li>
  <li>That this same very day your enemies,</li>
  <li class="number">The kindred of the queen, must die at Pomfret.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HASTINGS</li>
  <li>Indeed, I am no mourner for that news,</li>

  <li>To bar my master's heirs in true descent,</li>
  <li class="number">God knows I will not do it, to the death.</li>

  <li>We live to tell it you, the subtle traitor</li>

  <li>The manner and the purpose of his treason;</li>
  <li>That you might well have signified the same</li>

  <li>Which when I saw, I reprehended them;</li>
  <li>And ask'd the mayor what meant this wilful silence:</li>
  <li>His answer was, the people were not wont</li>
  <li class="number">To be spoke to but by the recorder.</li>
  <li>Then he was urged to tell my tale again,</li>
  <li>'Thus saith the duke, thus hath the duke inferr'd;'</li>

  <li>When he had done, some followers of mine own,</li>
  <li class="number">At the lower end of the hall, hurl'd up their caps,</li>
  <li>And some ten voices cried 'God save King Richard!'</li>
  <li>And thus I took the vantage of those few,</li>
  <li>'Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,' quoth I;</li>

  <li>But, God be thank'd, there's no need of me,</li>

  <li>The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,</li>
  <li class="number">Which, mellow'd by the stealing hours of time,</li>
  <li>Will well become the seat of majesty,</li>
  <li>And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.</li>

  <li>The right and fortune of his happy stars;</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</li>
  <li>My lord, this argues conscience in your grace;</li>
  <li>But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,</li>
  <li>All circumstances well considered.</li>
  <li>You say that Edward is your brother's son:</li>
  <li class="number">So say we too, but not by Edward's wife;</li>
  <li>For first he was contract to Lady Lucy â€” </li>
  <li>Your mother lives a witness to that vow â€” </li>
  <li>And afterward by substitute betroth'd</li>
  <li>To Bona, sister to the King of France.</li>
  <li class="number">These both put by a poor petitioner,</li>
  <li>A care-crazed mother of a many children,</li>
  <li>A beauty-waning and distressed widow,</li>
  <li>Even in the afternoon of her best days,</li>
  <li>Made prize and purchase of his lustful eye,</li>
  <li class="number">Seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughts</li>
  <li>To base declension and loathed bigamy</li>
  <li>By her, in his unlawful bed, he got</li>
  <li>This Edward, whom our manners term the prince.</li>
  <li>More bitterly could I expostulate,</li>
  <li class="number">Save that, for reverence to some alive,</li>
  <li>I give a sparing limit to my tongue.</li>
  <li>Then, good my lord, take to your royal self</li>
  <li>This proffer'd benefit of dignity;</li>
  <li>If non to bless us and the land withal,</li>
  <li class="number">Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry</li>
  <li>From the corruption of abusing times,</li>
  <li>Unto a lineal true-derived course.</li>

  <li>Your brother's son shall never reign our king;</li>

  <li>Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again,</li>

  <li class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</li>

  <li>Look, what is done cannot be now amended:</li>

  <li>If I have kill'd the issue of your womb,</li>
  <li class="number">To quicken your increase, I will beget</li>
  <li>Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter</li>
  <li>A grandam's name is little less in love</li>

  <li>They are as children but one step below,</li>
  <li class="number">Even of your mettle, of your very blood;</li>
  <li>Of an one pain, save for a night of groans</li>
  <li>Endured of her, for whom you bid like sorrow.</li>
  <li>Your children were vexation to your youth,</li>
  <li>But mine shall be a comfort to your age.</li>
  <li class="number">The loss you have is but a son being king,</li>
  <li>And by that loss your daughter is made queen.</li>
  <li>I cannot make you what amends I would,</li>

  <li>Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul</li>
  <li class="number">Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,</li>
  <li>This fair alliance quickly shall call home</li>
  <li>To high promotions and great dignity:</li>
  <li>The king, that calls your beauteous daughter wife.</li>
  <li>Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother;</li>
  <li class="number">Again shall you be mother to a king,</li>
  <li>And all the ruins of distressful times</li>
  <li>Repair'd with double riches of content.</li>
  <li>What! we have many goodly days to see:</li>
  <li>The liquid drops of tears that you have shed</li>
  <li class="number">Shall come again, transform'd to orient pearl,</li>
  <li>Advantaging their loan with interest</li>
  <li>Of ten times double gain of happiness.</li>
  <li>Go, then my mother, to thy daughter go</li>
  <li>Make bold her bashful years with your experience;</li>
  <li class="number">Prepare her ears to hear a wooer's tale</li>
  <li>Put in her tender heart the aspiring flame</li>
  <li>Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the princess</li>
  <li>With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys</li>
  <li>And when this arm of mine hath chastised</li>
  <li class="number">The petty rebel, dull-brain'd Buckingham,</li>
  <li>Bound with triumphant garlands will I come</li>
  <li>And lead thy daughter to a conqueror's bed;</li>
