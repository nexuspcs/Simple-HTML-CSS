<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FRANCISCO</li>
  <li>For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HORATIO</li>
  <li>A piece of him.</li>

  <li>Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MARCELLUS</li>
  <li>What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BERNARDO</li>
  <li>I have seen nothing.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MARCELLUS</li>
  <li class="number">Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,</li>
  <li>And will not let belief take hold of him</li>
  <li>Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:</li>
  <li>Therefore I have entreated him along</li>
  <li>With us to watch the minutes of this night;</li>
  <li class="number">That if again this apparition come,</li>
  <li>He may approve our eyes and speak to it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HORATIO</li>
  <li>Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BERNARDO</li>
  <li>Sit down awhile;</li>
  <li>And let us once again assail your ears,</li>
  <li class="number">That are so fortified against our story</li>
  <li>What we have two nights seen.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HORATIO</li>
  <li>Well, sit we down,</li>
  <li>And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BERNARDO</li>
  <li>Last night of all,</li>
  <li class="number">When yond same star that's westward from the pole</li>
  <li>Had made his course to illume that part of heaven</li>
  <li>Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,</li>
  <li>The bell then beating one —  </li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter Ghost</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MARCELLUS</li>
  <li>Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BERNARDO</li>
  <li class="number">In the same figure, like the king that's dead.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MARCELLUS</li>
  <li>Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BERNARDO</li>
  <li>Looks it not like the king?  mark it, Horatio.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HORATIO</li>
  <li>Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BERNARDO</li>
  <li>It would be spoke to.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MARCELLUS</li>
  <li class="number">Question it, Horatio.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HORATIO</li>
  <li>What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,</li>
  <li>Together with that fair and warlike form</li>
  <li>In which the majesty of buried Denmark</li>
  <li>Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MARCELLUS</li>
  <li class="number">It is offended.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BERNARDO</li>
  <li>See, it stalks away!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HORATIO</li>
  <li>Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit Ghost</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MARCELLUS</li>
  <li>'Tis gone, and will not answer.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BERNARDO</li>
  <li>How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:</li>
  <li class="number">Is not this something more than fantasy?</li>
  <li>What think you on't?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HORATIO</li>
  <li>Before my God, I might not this believe</li>
  <li>Without the sensible and true avouch</li>
  <li>Of mine own eyes.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MARCELLUS</li>
  <li class="number">Is it not like the king?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HORATIO</li>
  <li>As thou art to thyself:</li>
  <li>Such was the very armour he had on</li>
  <li>When he the ambitious Norway combated;</li>
  <li>So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,</li>
  <li class="number">He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.</li>
  <li>'Tis strange.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MARCELLUS</li>
  <li>Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,</li>
  <li>With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HORATIO</li>
  <li>In what particular thought to work I know not;</li>
  <li class="number">But in the gross and scope of my opinion,</li>
  <li>This bodes some strange eruption to our state.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MARCELLUS</li>
  <li>Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,</li>
  <li>Why this same strict and most observant watch</li>
  <li>So nightly toils the subject of the land,</li>
  <li class="number">And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,</li>
  <li>And foreign mart for implements of war;</li>
  <li>Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task</li>
  <li>Does not divide the Sunday from the week;</li>
  <li>What might be toward, that this sweaty haste</li>
  <li class="number">Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:</li>
  <li>Who is't that can inform me?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HORATIO</li>
  <li>That can I;</li>
  <li>At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,</li>
  <li>Whose image even but now appear'd to us,</li>
  <li class="number">Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,</li>
  <li>Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,</li>
  <li>Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet — </li>
  <li>For so this side of our known world esteem'd him — </li>
  <li>Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,</li>
  <li class="number">Well ratified by law and heraldry,</li>
  <li>Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands</li>
  <li>Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:</li>
  <li>Against the which, a moiety competent</li>
  <li>Was gaged by our king; which had return'd</li>
  <li class="number">To the inheritance of Fortinbras,</li>
  <li>Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,</li>
  <li>And carriage of the article design'd,</li>
  <li>His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,</li>
  <li>Of unimproved mettle hot and full,</li>
  <li class="number">Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there</li>
  <li>Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,</li>
  <li>For food and diet, to some enterprise</li>
  <li>That hath a stomach in't; which is no other — </li>
  <li>As it doth well appear unto our state — </li>
  <li class="number">But to recover of us, by strong hand</li>
  <li>And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands</li>
  <li>So by his father lost: and this, I take it,</li>
  <li>Is the main motive of our preparations,</li>
  <li>The source of this our watch and the chief head</li>
  <li class="number">Of this post-haste and romage in the land.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BERNARDO</li>
  <li>I think it be no other but e'en so:</li>
  <li>Well may it sort that this portentous figure</li>
  <li>Comes armed through our watch; so like the king</li>
  <li>That was and is the question of these wars.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HORATIO</li>
  <li class="number">A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.</li>
  <li>In the most high and palmy state of Rome,</li>
  <li>A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,</li>
  <li>The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead</li>
  <li>Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:</li>
  <li class="number">As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,</li>
  <li>Disasters in the sun; and the moist star</li>
  <li>Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands</li>
  <li>Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:</li>
  <li>And even the like precurse of fierce events,</li>
  <li class="number">As harbingers preceding still the fates</li>
  <li>And prologue to the omen coming on,</li>
  <li>Have heaven and earth together demonstrated</li>
  <li>Unto our climatures and countrymen. — </li>
  <li>But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Re-enter Ghost</li>
  <li class="number">I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!</li>
  <li>If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,</li>
  <li>Speak to me:</li>
  <li>If there be any good thing to be done,</li>
  <li>That may to thee do ease and grace to me,</li>
  <li class="number">Speak to me:</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Cock crows</li>
  <li>If thou art privy to thy country's fate,</li>
  <li>Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!</li>
  <li>Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life</li>
  <li>Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,</li>
  <li class="number">For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,</li>
  <li>Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MARCELLUS</li>
  <li>Shall I strike at it with my partisan?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HORATIO</li>
  <li>Do, if it will not stand.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BERNARDO</li>
  <li>'Tis here!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HORATIO</li>
  <li class="number">'Tis here!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MARCELLUS</li>
  <li>'Tis gone!</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Exit Ghost</li>
  <li>We do it wrong, being so majestical,</li>
  <li>To offer it the show of violence;</li>
  <li>For it is, as the air, invulnerable,</li>
  <li class="number">And our vain blows malicious mockery.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BERNARDO</li>
  <li>It was about to speak, when the cock crew.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HORATIO</li>
  <li>And then it started like a guilty thing</li>
  <li>Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,</li>
  <li>The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,</li>
  <li class="number">Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat</li>
  <li>Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,</li>
  <li>Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,</li>
  <li>The extravagant and erring spirit hies</li>
  <li>To his confine: and of the truth herein</li>
  <li class="number">This present object made probation.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MARCELLUS</li>
  <li>It faded on the crowing of the cock.</li>
  <li>Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes</li>
  <li>Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,</li>
  <li>The bird of dawning singeth all night long:</li>
  <li class="number">And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;</li>
  <li>The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,</li>
  <li>No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,</li>
  <li>So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HORATIO</li>
  <li>So have I heard and do in part believe it.</li>
  <li class="number">But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,</li>
  <li>Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:</li>
  <li>Break we our watch up; and by my advice,</li>
  <li>Let us impart what we have seen to-night</li>
  <li>Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,</li>
  <li class="number">This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.</li>
  <li>Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,</li>
  <li>As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MARCELLUS</li>
  <li>Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know</li>
  <li>Where we shall find him most conveniently.</li>

<h3>SCENE II.  A room of state in the castle.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, HAMLET,
POLONIUS, LAERTES, VOLTIMAND, CORNELIUS, Lords,
and Attendants</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING CLAUDIUS</li>
  <li>Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death</li>
  <li>The memory be green, and that it us befitted</li>
  <li>To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom</li>
  <li>To be contracted in one brow of woe,</li>
  <li class="number">Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature</li>
  <li>That we with wisest sorrow think on him,</li>
  <li>Together with remembrance of ourselves.</li>
  <li>Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,</li>
  <li>The imperial jointress to this warlike state,</li>
  <li class="number">Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy —  </li>
  <li>With an auspicious and a dropping eye,</li>
  <li>With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,</li>
  <li>In equal scale weighing delight and dole —  </li>
  <li>Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd</li>
  <li class="number">Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone</li>
  <li>With this affair along. For all, our thanks.</li>
  <li>Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,</li>
  <li>Holding a weak supposal of our worth,</li>
  <li>Or thinking by our late dear brother's death</li>
  <li class="number">Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,</li>
  <li>Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,</li>
  <li>He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,</li>
  <li>Importing the surrender of those lands</li>
  <li>Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,</li>
  <li class="number">To our most valiant brother. So much for him.</li>
  <li>Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:</li>
  <li>Thus much the business is: we have here writ</li>
  <li>To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras —  </li>
  <li>Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears</li>
  <li class="number">Of this his nephew's purpose —  to suppress</li>
  <li>His further gait herein; in that the levies,</li>
  <li>The lists and full proportions, are all made</li>
  <li>Out of his subject: and we here dispatch</li>
  <li>You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,</li>
  <li class="number">For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;</li>
  <li>Giving to you no further personal power</li>
  <li>To business with the king, more than the scope</li>
  <li>Of these delated articles allow.</li>
  <li>Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CORNELIUS</li>
  <li class="speaker">VOLTIMAND</li>
  <li class="number">In that and all things will we show our duty.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING CLAUDIUS</li>
  <li>We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS</li>
  <li>And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?</li>
  <li>You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?</li>
  <li>You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,</li>
  <li class="number">And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,</li>
  <li>That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?</li>
  <li>The head is not more native to the heart,</li>
  <li>The hand more instrumental to the mouth,</li>
  <li>Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.</li>
  <li class="number">What wouldst thou have, Laertes?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LAERTES</li>
  <li>My dread lord,</li>
  <li>Your leave and favour to return to France;</li>
  <li>From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,</li>
  <li>To show my duty in your coronation,</li>
  <li class="number">Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,</li>
  <li>My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France</li>
  <li>And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING CLAUDIUS</li>
  <li>Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LORD POLONIUS</li>
  <li>He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave</li>
  <li class="number">By laboursome petition, and at last</li>
  <li>Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:</li>
  <li>I do beseech you, give him leave to go.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING CLAUDIUS</li>
  <li>Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,</li>
  <li>And thy best graces spend it at thy will!</li>
  <li class="number">But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son —  </li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li>Aside  A little more than kin, and less than kind.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING CLAUDIUS</li>
  <li>How is it that the clouds still hang on you?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li>Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">QUEEN GERTRUDE</li>
  <li>Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,</li>
  <li class="number">And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.</li>
  <li>Do not for ever with thy vailed lids</li>
  <li>Seek for thy noble father in the dust:</li>
  <li>Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,</li>
  <li>Passing through nature to eternity.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li class="number">Ay, madam, it is common.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">QUEEN GERTRUDE</li>
  <li>If it be,</li>
  <li>Why seems it so particular with thee?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li>Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'</li>
  <li>'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,</li>
  <li class="number">Nor customary suits of solemn black,</li>
  <li>Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,</li>
  <li>No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,</li>
  <li>Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,</li>
  <li>Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,</li>
  <li class="number">That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,</li>
  <li>For they are actions that a man might play:</li>
  <li>But I have that within which passeth show;</li>
  <li>These but the trappings and the suits of woe.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING CLAUDIUS</li>
  <li>'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,</li>
  <li class="number">To give these mourning duties to your father:</li>
  <li>But, you must know, your father lost a father;</li>
  <li>That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound</li>
  <li>In filial obligation for some term</li>
  <li>To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever</li>
  <li class="number">In obstinate condolement is a course</li>
  <li>Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;</li>
  <li>It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,</li>
  <li>A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,</li>
  <li>An understanding simple and unschool'd:</li>
  <li class="number">For what we know must be and is as common</li>
  <li>As any the most vulgar thing to sense,</li>
  <li>Why should we in our peevish opposition</li>
  <li>Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,</li>
  <li>A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,</li>
  <li class="number">To reason most absurd: whose common theme</li>
  <li>Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,</li>
  <li>From the first corse till he that died to-day,</li>
  <li>'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth</li>
  <li>This unprevailing woe, and think of us</li>
  <li class="number">As of a father: for let the world take note,</li>
  <li>You are the most immediate to our throne;</li>
  <li>And with no less nobility of love</li>
  <li>Than that which dearest father bears his son,</li>
  <li>Do I impart toward you. For your intent</li>
  <li class="number">In going back to school in Wittenberg,</li>
  <li>It is most retrograde to our desire:</li>
  <li>And we beseech you, bend you to remain</li>
  <li>Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,</li>

  <li>Two nights together had these gentlemen,</li>

  <li>In the dead vast and middle of the night,</li>
  <li>Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,</li>
  <li class="number">Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,</li>
  <li>Appears before them, and with solemn march</li>
  <li>Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd</li>
  <li>By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,</li>
  <li>Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distilled</li>
  <li class="number">Almost to jelly with the act of fear,</li>
  <li>Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me</li>
  <li>In dreadful secrecy impart they did;</li>
  <li>And I with them the third night kept the watch;</li>
  <li>Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,</li>
  <li class="number">Form of the thing, each word made true and good,</li>
  <li>The apparition comes: I knew your father;</li>
  <li>These hands are not more like.</li>

  <li>My lord, I did;</li>
  <li>But answer made it none: yet once methought</li>

  <li>Itself to motion, like as it would speak;</li>
  <li class="number">But even then the morning cock crew loud,</li>
  <li>And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,</li>
  <li>And vanish'd from our sight.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li>'Tis very strange.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HORATIO</li>
  <li>As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;</li>

  <li>My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:</li>

  <li class="speaker">LAERTES</li>
  <li>For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,</li>
  <li>Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,</li>
  <li>A violet in the youth of primy nature,</li>
  <li>Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,</li>
  <li class="number">The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.</li>

<ol class="speech">

  <li>No more but so?</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LAERTES</li>
  <li>Think it no more;</li>
  <li>For nature, crescent, does not grow alone</li>
  <li>In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,</li>
  <li class="number">The inward service of the mind and soul</li>
  <li>Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,</li>
  <li>And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch</li>
  <li>The virtue of his will: but you must fear,</li>
  <li>His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;</li>
  <li class="number">For he himself is subject to his birth:</li>
  <li>He may not, as unvalued persons do,</li>
  <li>Carve for himself; for on his choice depends</li>
  <li>The safety and health of this whole state;</li>
  <li>And therefore must his choice be circumscribed</li>
  <li class="number">Unto the voice and yielding of that body</li>
  <li>Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,</li>
  <li>It fits your wisdom so far to believe it</li>
  <li>As he in his particular act and place</li>
  <li>May give his saying deed; which is no further</li>
  <li class="number">Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.</li>
  <li>Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,</li>
  <li>If with too credent ear you list his songs,</li>
  <li>Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open</li>
  <li>To his unmaster'd importunity.</li>
  <li class="number">Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,</li>
  <li>And keep you in the rear of your affection,</li>
  <li>Out of the shot and danger of desire.</li>
  <li>The chariest maid is prodigal enough,</li>
  <li>If she unmask her beauty to the moon:</li>
  <li class="number">Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:</li>
  <li>The canker galls the infants of the spring,</li>
  <li>Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,</li>
  <li>And in the morn and liquid dew of youth</li>
  <li>Contagious blastments are most imminent.</li>

  <li>Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.</li>

  <li>Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.</li>

  <li>Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,</li>
  <li class="number">Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.</li>
  <li>Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;</li>
  <li>Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.</li>
  <li>Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,</li>
  <li>But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;</li>
  <li class="number">For the apparel oft proclaims the man,</li>

  <li>The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.</li>

  <li class="speaker">HORATIO</li>
  <li>It is a nipping and an eager air.</li>

  <li class="speaker">HORATIO</li>
  <li>Indeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the season</li>
  <li>Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off, within</li>
  <li>What does this mean, my lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li>The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,</li>

  <li>The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out</li>
  <li>The triumph of his pledge.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HORATIO</li>
  <li>Is it a custom?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li class="number">Ay, marry, is't:</li>
  <li>But to my mind, though I am native here</li>
  <li>And to the manner born, it is a custom</li>
  <li>More honour'd in the breach than the observance.</li>
  <li>This heavy-headed revel east and west</li>
  <li class="number">Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:</li>
  <li>They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase</li>
  <li>Soil our addition; and indeed it takes</li>
  <li>From our achievements, though perform'd at height,</li>
  <li>The pith and marrow of our attribute.</li>
  <li class="number">So, oft it chances in particular men,</li>
  <li>That for some vicious mole of nature in them,</li>
  <li>As, in their birth — wherein they are not guilty,</li>
  <li>Since nature cannot choose his origin — </li>
  <li>By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,</li>
  <li class="number">Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,</li>
  <li>Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens</li>
  <li>The form of plausive manners, that these men,</li>
  <li>Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,</li>
  <li>Being nature's livery, or fortune's star —  </li>
  <li class="number">Their virtues else — be they as pure as grace,</li>
  <li>As infinite as man may undergo — </li>
  <li>Shall in the general censure take corruption</li>

  <li>The leperous distilment; whose effect</li>
  <li class="number">Holds such an enmity with blood of man</li>

  <li>Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand</li>

  <li class="number">O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!</li>
  <li>If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;</li>
  <li>Let not the royal bed of Denmark be</li>

  <li>Well said, old mole! canst work i' the earth so fast?</li>
  <li>A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HORATIO</li>
  <li>O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li>And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.</li>
  <li class="number">There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,</li>

  <li>Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,</li>
  <li>How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself,</li>
  <li>As I perchance hereafter shall think meet</li>
  <li class="number">To put an antic disposition on,</li>
  <li>That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,</li>
  <li>With arms encumber'd thus, or this headshake,</li>
  <li>Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,</li>
  <li>As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'</li>
  <li class="number">Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'</li>

<h3>SCENE I.  A room in POLONIUS' house.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter POLONIUS and REYNALDO</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LORD POLONIUS</li>
  <li>Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">REYNALDO</li>
  <li>I will, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LORD POLONIUS</li>
  <li>You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo,</li>
  <li>Before you visit him, to make inquire</li>
  <li class="number">Of his behavior.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">REYNALDO</li>
  <li>My lord, I did intend it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LORD POLONIUS</li>
  <li>Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,</li>
  <li>Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;</li>
  <li>And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,</li>
  <li class="number">What company, at what expense; and finding</li>
  <li>By this encompassment and drift of question</li>
  <li>That they do know my son, come you more nearer</li>
  <li>Than your particular demands will touch it:</li>
  <li>Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;</li>
  <li class="number">As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,</li>
  <li>And in part him: ' do you mark this, Reynaldo?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">REYNALDO</li>
  <li>Ay, very well, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LORD POLONIUS</li>
  <li>'And in part him; but' you may say 'not well:</li>
  <li>But, if't be he I mean, he's very wild;</li>
  <li class="number">Addicted so and so:' and there put on him</li>
  <li>What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank</li>
  <li>As may dishonour him; take heed of that;</li>
  <li>But, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slips</li>
  <li>As are companions noted and most known</li>
  <li class="number">To youth and liberty.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">REYNALDO</li>
  <li>As gaming, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LORD POLONIUS</li>
  <li>Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,</li>
  <li>Drabbing: you may go so far.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">REYNALDO</li>
  <li>My lord, that would dishonour him.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LORD POLONIUS</li>
  <li class="number">'Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge</li>
  <li>You must not put another scandal on him,</li>
  <li>That he is open to incontinency;</li>
  <li>That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly</li>
  <li>That they may seem the taints of liberty,</li>
  <li class="number">The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,</li>
  <li>A savageness in unreclaimed blood,</li>
  <li>Of general assault.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">REYNALDO</li>
  <li>But, my good lord —  </li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LORD POLONIUS</li>
  <li>Wherefore should you do this?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">REYNALDO</li>
  <li class="number">Ay, my lord,</li>
  <li>I would know that.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LORD POLONIUS</li>
  <li>Marry, sir, here's my drift;</li>
  <li>And I believe, it is a fetch of wit:</li>
  <li>You laying these slight sullies on my son,</li>
  <li class="number">As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working, Mark you,</li>
  <li>Your party in converse, him you would sound,</li>
  <li>Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes</li>
  <li>The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured</li>
  <li>He closes with you in this consequence;</li>
  <li class="number">'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman,'</li>
  <li>According to the phrase or the addition</li>
  <li>Of man and country.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">REYNALDO</li>
  <li>Very good, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LORD POLONIUS</li>
  <li>And then, sir, does he this — he does — what was I</li>
  <li class="number">about to say? By the mass, I was about to say</li>
  <li>something: where did I leave?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">REYNALDO</li>
  <li>At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,'</li>
  <li>and 'gentleman.'</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LORD POLONIUS</li>
  <li>At 'closes in the consequence,' ay, marry;</li>
  <li class="number">He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman;</li>
  <li>I saw him yesterday, or t' other day,</li>
  <li>Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,</li>
  <li>There was a' gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;</li>
  <li>There falling out at tennis:' or perchance,</li>
  <li class="number">'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'</li>
  <li>Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.</li>
  <li>See you now;</li>
  <li>Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:</li>
  <li>And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,</li>
  <li class="number">With windlasses and with assays of bias,</li>
  <li>By indirections find directions out:</li>
  <li>So by my former lecture and advice,</li>
  <li>Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">REYNALDO</li>
  <li>My lord, I have.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LORD POLONIUS</li>
  <li class="number">God be wi' you; fare you well.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">REYNALDO</li>
  <li>Good my lord!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LORD POLONIUS</li>
  <li>Observe his inclination in yourself.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">REYNALDO</li>
  <li>I shall, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LORD POLONIUS</li>
  <li>And let him ply his music.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">REYNALDO</li>
  <li class="number">Well, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LORD POLONIUS</li>
  <li>Farewell!</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Exit REYNALDO</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Enter OPHELIA</li>
  <li>How now, Ophelia! what's the matter?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OPHELIA</li>
  <li>O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LORD POLONIUS</li>
  <li>With what, i' the name of God?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OPHELIA</li>
  <li class="number">My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,</li>
  <li>Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced;</li>
  <li>No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd,</li>
  <li>Ungarter'd, and down-gyved to his ancle;</li>
  <li>Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;</li>
  <li class="number">And with a look so piteous in purport</li>
  <li>As if he had been loosed out of hell</li>
  <li>To speak of horrors —  he comes before me.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LORD POLONIUS</li>
  <li>Mad for thy love?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OPHELIA</li>
  <li>My lord, I do not know;</li>
  <li class="number">But truly, I do fear it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LORD POLONIUS</li>
  <li>What said he?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OPHELIA</li>
  <li>He took me by the wrist and held me hard;</li>
  <li>Then goes he to the length of all his arm;</li>
  <li>And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,</li>
  <li class="number">He falls to such perusal of my face</li>
  <li>As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;</li>
  <li>At last, a little shaking of mine arm</li>
  <li>And thrice his head thus waving up and down,</li>
  <li>He raised a sigh so piteous and profound</li>
  <li class="number">As it did seem to shatter all his bulk</li>
  <li>And end his being: that done, he lets me go:</li>
  <li>And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd,</li>
  <li>He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;</li>
  <li>For out o' doors he went without their helps,</li>
  <li class="number">And, to the last, bended their light on me.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LORD POLONIUS</li>
  <li>Come, go with me: I will go seek the king.</li>
  <li>This is the very ecstasy of love,</li>
  <li>Whose violent property fordoes itself</li>
  <li>And leads the will to desperate undertakings</li>
  <li class="number">As oft as any passion under heaven</li>
  <li>That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.</li>
  <li>What, have you given him any hard words of late?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OPHELIA</li>
  <li>No, my good lord, but, as you did command,</li>
  <li>I did repel his fetters and denied</li>
  <li class="number">His access to me.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LORD POLONIUS</li>
  <li>That hath made him mad.</li>
  <li>I am sorry that with better heed and judgment</li>
  <li>I had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle,</li>
  <li>And meant to wreck thee; but, beshrew my jealousy!</li>
  <li class="number">By heaven, it is as proper to our age</li>
  <li>To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions</li>
  <li>As it is common for the younger sort</li>
  <li>To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:</li>
  <li>This must be known; which, being kept close, might</li>
  <li class="number">move</li>
  <li>More grief to hide than hate to utter love.</li>

<h3>SCENE II.  A room in the castle.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, ROSENCRANTZ,

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING CLAUDIUS</li>
  <li>Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!</li>
  <li>Moreover that we much did long to see you,</li>
  <li>The need we have to use you did provoke</li>
  <li>Our hasty sending. Something have you heard</li>
  <li class="number">Of Hamlet's transformation; so call it,</li>
  <li>Sith nor the exterior nor the inward man</li>
  <li>Resembles that it was. What it should be,</li>
  <li>More than his father's death, that thus hath put him</li>
  <li>So much from the understanding of himself,</li>
  <li class="number">I cannot dream of: I entreat you both,</li>
  <li>That, being of so young days brought up with him,</li>
  <li>And sith so neighbour'd to his youth and havior,</li>
  <li>That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court</li>
  <li>Some little time: so by your companies</li>
  <li class="number">To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,</li>
  <li>So much as from occasion you may glean,</li>
  <li>Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,</li>
  <li>That, open'd, lies within our remedy.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">QUEEN GERTRUDE</li>
  <li>Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you;</li>
  <li class="number">And sure I am two men there are not living</li>
  <li>To whom he more adheres. If it will please you</li>
  <li>To show us so much gentry and good will</li>
  <li>As to expend your time with us awhile,</li>
  <li>For the supply and profit of our hope,</li>
  <li class="number">Your visitation shall receive such thanks</li>
  <li>As fits a king's remembrance.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSENCRANTZ</li>
  <li>Both your majesties</li>
  <li>Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,</li>
  <li>Put your dread pleasures more into command</li>
  <li class="number">Than to entreaty.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GUILDENSTERN</li>
  <li>But we both obey,</li>

  <li>Have I, my lord? I assure my good liege,</li>
  <li>I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,</li>
  <li>Both to my God and to my gracious king:</li>
  <li>And I do think, or else this brain of mine</li>
  <li class="number">Hunts not the trail of policy so sure</li>
  <li>As it hath used to do, that I have found</li>
  <li>The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING CLAUDIUS</li>
  <li>O, speak of that; that do I long to hear.</li>

  <li class="stage-direction">Exit POLONIUS</li>
  <li>He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found</li>
  <li>The head and source of all your son's distemper.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">QUEEN GERTRUDE</li>
  <li>I doubt it is no other but the main;</li>
  <li class="number">His father's death, and our o'erhasty marriage.</li>

  <li class="speaker">KING CLAUDIUS</li>
  <li>Well, we shall sift him.</li>

  <li>Welcome, my good friends!</li>
  <li>Say, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">VOLTIMAND</li>
  <li>Most fair return of greetings and desires.</li>
  <li class="number">Upon our first, he sent out to suppress</li>
  <li>His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd</li>
  <li>To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack;</li>
  <li>But, better look'd into, he truly found</li>
  <li>It was against your highness: whereat grieved,</li>
  <li class="number">That so his sickness, age and impotence</li>
  <li>Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests</li>
  <li>On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;</li>
  <li>Receives rebuke from Norway, and in fine</li>
  <li>Makes vow before his uncle never more</li>
  <li class="number">To give the assay of arms against your majesty.</li>
  <li>Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,</li>
  <li>Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee,</li>
  <li>And his commission to employ those soldiers,</li>
  <li>So levied as before, against the Polack:</li>
  <li class="number">With an entreaty, herein further shown,</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Giving a paper</li>
  <li>That it might please you to give quiet pass</li>
  <li>Through your dominions for this enterprise,</li>
  <li>On such regards of safety and allowance</li>
  <li>As therein are set down.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING CLAUDIUS</li>
  <li class="number">It likes us well;</li>
  <li>And at our more consider'd time well read,</li>

  <li>Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour:</li>
  <li>Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together:</li>
  <li class="number">Most welcome home!</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LORD POLONIUS</li>
  <li>This business is well ended.</li>
  <li>My liege, and madam, to expostulate</li>
  <li>What majesty should be, what duty is,</li>
  <li>Why day is day, night night, and time is time,</li>
  <li class="number">Were nothing but to waste night, day and time.</li>
  <li>Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,</li>
  <li>And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,</li>
  <li>I will be brief: your noble son is mad:</li>
  <li>Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,</li>
  <li class="number">What is't but to be nothing else but mad?</li>
  <li>But let that go.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">QUEEN GERTRUDE</li>
  <li>More matter, with less art.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LORD POLONIUS</li>
  <li>Madam, I swear I use no art at all.</li>
  <li>That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;</li>
  <li class="number">And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure;</li>
  <li>But farewell it, for I will use no art.</li>
  <li>Mad let us grant him, then: and now remains</li>
  <li>That we find out the cause of this effect,</li>
  <li>Or rather say, the cause of this defect,</li>
  <li class="number">For this effect defective comes by cause:</li>
  <li>Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Perpend.</li>
  <li>I have a daughter — have while she is mine — </li>
  <li>Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,</li>
  <li>Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Reads</li>
  <li class="number">'To the celestial and my soul's idol, the most</li>
  <li>beautified Ophelia,' — </li>
  <li>That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is</li>
  <li>a vile phrase: but you shall hear. Thus:</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Reads</li>
  <li>'In her excellent white bosom, these, etc..'</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">QUEEN GERTRUDE</li>
  <li class="number">Came this from Hamlet to her?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LORD POLONIUS</li>
  <li>Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Reads</li>
  <li>'Doubt thou the stars are fire;</li>
  <li>Doubt that the sun doth move;</li>
  <li>Doubt truth to be a liar;</li>
  <li class="number">But never doubt I love.</li>
  <li>'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers;</li>
  <li>I have not art to reckon my groans: but that</li>
  <li>I love thee best, O most best, believe it. Adieu.</li>
  <li>'Thine evermore most dear lady, whilst</li>
  <li class="number">this machine is to him, HAMLET.'</li>
  <li>This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me,</li>
  <li>And more above, hath his solicitings,</li>
  <li>As they fell out by time, by means and place,</li>
  <li>All given to mine ear.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING CLAUDIUS</li>
  <li class="number">But how hath she</li>
  <li>Received his love?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LORD POLONIUS</li>
  <li>What do you think of me?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING CLAUDIUS</li>
  <li>As of a man faithful and honourable.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LORD POLONIUS</li>
  <li>I would fain prove so. But what might you think,</li>
  <li class="number">When I had seen this hot love on the wing — </li>
  <li>As I perceived it, I must tell you that,</li>
  <li>Before my daughter told me — what might you,</li>
  <li>Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,</li>
  <li>If I had play'd the desk or table-book,</li>
  <li class="number">Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,</li>
  <li>Or look'd upon this love with idle sight;</li>
  <li>What might you think? No, I went round to work,</li>
  <li>And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:</li>
  <li>'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star;</li>
  <li class="number">This must not be:' and then I precepts gave her,</li>

  <li>It may be, very likely.</li>

  <li class="number">Not I, my lord.</li>

  <li class="speaker">LORD POLONIUS</li>
  <li>Honest, my lord!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li>Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be</li>

  <li class="speaker">LORD POLONIUS</li>
  <li class="number">That's very true, my lord.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li>For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a</li>

  <li class="speaker">LORD POLONIUS</li>
  <li>I have, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li>Let her not walk i' the sun: conception is a</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LORD POLONIUS</li>

  <li class="number">truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for</li>

  <li>What do you read, my lord?</li>

  <li class="speaker">LORD POLONIUS</li>
  <li>I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li>Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here</li>
  <li>that old men have grey beards, that their faces are</li>
  <li>wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and</li>
  <li class="number">plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of</li>
  <li>wit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir,</li>
  <li>though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet</li>
  <li>I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down, for</li>
  <li>yourself, sir, should be old as I am, if like a crab</li>
  <li class="number">you could go backward.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LORD POLONIUS</li>

  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li>Into my grave.</li>

  <li class="speaker">ROSENCRANTZ</li>

  <li class="speaker">ROSENCRANTZ</li>
  <li>Neither, my lord.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li>Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GUILDENSTERN</li>
  <li>'Faith, her privates we.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li class="number">In the secret parts of fortune? O, most true; she</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSENCRANTZ</li>
  <li>None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li>Then is doomsday near: but your news is not true.</li>
  <li>Let me question more in particular: what have you,</li>

  <li>that she sends you to prison hither?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GUILDENSTERN</li>
  <li>Prison, my lord!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li>Denmark's a prison.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSENCRANTZ</li>
  <li>Then is the world one.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li class="number">A goodly one; in which there are many confines,</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSENCRANTZ</li>
  <li>We think not so, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li>Why, then, 'tis none to you; for there is nothing</li>
  <li>either good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me</li>
  <li class="number">it is a prison.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSENCRANTZ</li>
  <li>Why then, your ambition makes it one; 'tis too</li>
  <li>narrow for your mind.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li>O God, I could be bounded in a nut shell and count</li>
  <li>myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I</li>
  <li class="number">have bad dreams.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GUILDENSTERN</li>
  <li>Which dreams indeed are ambition, for the very</li>
  <li>substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li>A dream itself is but a shadow.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSENCRANTZ</li>
  <li>Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a</li>
  <li class="number">quality that it is but a shadow's shadow.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li>Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and</li>
  <li>outstretched heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we</li>
  <li>to the court? for, by my fay, I cannot reason.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSENCRANTZ</li>
  <li class="speaker">GUILDENSTERN</li>
  <li>We'll wait upon you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li class="number">No such matter: I will not sort you with the rest</li>
  <li>of my servants, for, to speak to you like an honest</li>
  <li>man, I am most dreadfully attended. But, in the</li>
  <li>beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSENCRANTZ</li>
  <li>To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li class="number">Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I</li>
  <li>thank you: and sure, dear friends, my thanks are</li>
  <li>too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it</li>
  <li>your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come,</li>
  <li>deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GUILDENSTERN</li>
  <li class="number">What should we say, my lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li>Why, any thing, but to the purpose. You were sent</li>
  <li>for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks</li>
  <li>which your modesties have not craft enough to colour:</li>
  <li>I know the good king and queen have sent for you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSENCRANTZ</li>
  <li class="number">To what end, my lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li>That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by</li>
  <li>the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of</li>
  <li>our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved</li>
  <li>love, and by what more dear a better proposer could</li>
  <li class="number">charge you withal, be even and direct with me,</li>
  <li>whether you were sent for, or no?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSENCRANTZ</li>
  <li>Aside to GUILDENSTERN  What say you?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li>Aside  Nay, then, I have an eye of you. — If you</li>
  <li>love me, hold not off.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GUILDENSTERN</li>
  <li class="number">My lord, we were sent for.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li>I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation</li>
  <li>prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king</li>
  <li>and queen moult no feather. I have of late — but</li>
  <li>wherefore I know not — lost all my mirth, forgone all</li>
  <li class="number">custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily</li>
  <li>with my disposition that this goodly frame, the</li>
  <li>earth, seems to me a sterile promontory, this most</li>
  <li>excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave</li>
  <li>o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted</li>
  <li class="number">with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to</li>
  <li>me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours.</li>
  <li>What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason!</li>
  <li>how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how</li>
  <li>express and admirable! in action how like an angel!</li>
  <li class="number">in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the</li>
  <li>world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me,</li>
  <li>what is this quintessence of dust? man delights not</li>
  <li>me: no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling</li>
  <li>you seem to say so.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSENCRANTZ</li>
  <li class="number">My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li>Why did you laugh then, when I said 'man delights not me'?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSENCRANTZ</li>
  <li>To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what</li>
  <li>lenten entertainment the players shall receive from</li>
  <li>you: we coted them on the way; and hither are they</li>
  <li class="number">coming, to offer you service.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li>He that plays the king shall be welcome; his majesty</li>
  <li>shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight</li>
  <li>shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not</li>
  <li>sigh gratis; the humourous man shall end his part</li>
  <li class="number">in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose</li>
  <li>lungs are tickled o' the sere; and the lady shall</li>
  <li>say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt</li>
  <li>for't. What players are they?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSENCRANTZ</li>
  <li>Even those you were wont to take delight in, the</li>
  <li class="number">tragedians of the city.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li>How chances it they travel? their residence, both</li>
  <li>in reputation and profit, was better both ways.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSENCRANTZ</li>
  <li>I think their inhibition comes by the means of the</li>
  <li>late innovation.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li class="number">Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was</li>
  <li>in the city? are they so followed?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSENCRANTZ</li>
  <li>No, indeed, are they not.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li>How comes it? do they grow rusty?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSENCRANTZ</li>
  <li>Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but</li>
  <li class="number">there is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases,</li>
  <li>that cry out on the top of question, and are most</li>
  <li>tyrannically clapped for't: these are now the</li>
  <li>fashion, and so berattle the common stages — so they</li>
  <li>call them — that many wearing rapiers are afraid of</li>
  <li class="number">goose-quills and dare scarce come thither.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li>What, are they children? who maintains 'em? how are</li>
  <li>they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no</li>
  <li>longer than they can sing? will they not say</li>
  <li>afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common</li>
  <li class="number">players — as it is most like, if their means are no</li>
  <li>better — their writers do them wrong, to make them</li>
  <li>exclaim against their own succession?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSENCRANTZ</li>
  <li>'Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and</li>
  <li>the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to</li>
  <li class="number">controversy: there was, for a while, no money bid</li>
  <li>for argument, unless the poet and the player went to</li>
  <li>cuffs in the question.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li>Is't possible?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GUILDENSTERN</li>
  <li>O, there has been much throwing about of brains.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li class="number">Do the boys carry it away?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSENCRANTZ</li>
  <li>Ay, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li>It is not very strange; for mine uncle is king of</li>
  <li>Denmark, and those that would make mows at him while</li>
  <li>my father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, an</li>
  <li class="number">hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little.</li>
  <li>'Sblood, there is something in this more than</li>

  <li>Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands,</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li>Why,</li>
  <li>'As by lot, God wot,'</li>
  <li class="number">and then, you know,</li>
  <li>'It came to pass, as most like it was,' — </li>
  <li>the first row of the pious chanson will show you</li>
  <li>more; for look, where my abridgement comes.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Enter four or five Players</li>
  <li>You are welcome, masters; welcome, all. I am glad</li>

  <li>comest thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young</li>
  <li>lady and mistress! By'r lady, your ladyship is</li>
  <li>nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the</li>
  <li class="number">altitude of a chopine. Pray God, your voice, like</li>
  <li>apiece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Player</li>
  <li>What speech, my lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li>I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was</li>
  <li>never acted; or, if it was, not above once; for the</li>
  <li>play, I remember, pleased not the million; 'twas</li>
  <li class="number">caviare to the general: but it was — as I received</li>
  <li>it, and others, whose judgments in such matters</li>
  <li>cried in the top of mine — an excellent play, well</li>
  <li>digested in the scenes, set down with as much</li>
  <li>modesty as cunning. I remember, one said there</li>
  <li class="number">were no sallets in the lines to make the matter</li>
  <li>savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might</li>
  <li>indict the author of affectation; but called it an</li>
  <li>honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very</li>
  <li>much more handsome than fine. One speech in it I</li>
  <li class="number">chiefly loved: 'twas Aeneas' tale to Dido; and</li>
  <li>thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of</li>
  <li>Priam's slaughter: if it live in your memory, begin</li>
  <li>at this line: let me see, let me see — </li>
  <li>'The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,' — </li>
  <li class="number">it is not so: — it begins with Pyrrhus: — </li>
  <li>'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,</li>
  <li>Black as his purpose, did the night resemble</li>
  <li>When he lay couched in the ominous horse,</li>
  <li>Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd</li>
  <li class="number">With heraldry more dismal; head to foot</li>
  <li>Now is he total gules; horridly trick'd</li>
  <li>With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,</li>
  <li>Baked and impasted with the parching streets,</li>
  <li>That lend a tyrannous and damned light</li>
  <li class="number">To their lord's murder: roasted in wrath and fire,</li>
  <li>And thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore,</li>
  <li>With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus</li>
  <li>Old grandsire Priam seeks.'</li>
  <li>So, proceed you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LORD POLONIUS</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Player</li>
  <li>'Anon he finds him</li>
  <li>Striking too short at Greeks; his antique sword,</li>
  <li>Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,</li>
  <li class="number">Repugnant to command: unequal match'd,</li>
  <li>Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;</li>
  <li>But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword</li>
  <li>The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,</li>
  <li>Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top</li>
  <li class="number">Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash</li>
  <li>Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for, lo! his sword,</li>
  <li>Which was declining on the milky head</li>
  <li>Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick:</li>
  <li>So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,</li>
  <li class="number">And like a neutral to his will and matter,</li>
  <li>Did nothing.</li>
  <li>But, as we often see, against some storm,</li>
  <li>A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,</li>
  <li>The bold winds speechless and the orb below</li>
  <li class="number">As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder</li>
  <li>Doth rend the region, so, after Pyrrhus' pause,</li>
  <li>Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work;</li>
  <li>And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall</li>
  <li>On Mars's armour forged for proof eterne</li>
  <li class="number">With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword</li>
  <li>Now falls on Priam.</li>
  <li>Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,</li>
  <li>In general synod 'take away her power;</li>
  <li>Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,</li>
  <li class="number">And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,</li>

  <li>Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd,</li>

  <li>In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,</li>
  <li class="number">The instant burst of clamour that she made,</li>
  <li>Unless things mortal move them not at all,</li>

  <li>'Tis well: I'll have thee speak out the rest soon.</li>
  <li>Good my lord, will you see the players well</li>
  <li>bestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used; for</li>
  <li>they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the</li>

  <li>My lord, I will use them according to their desert.</li>

  <li class="stage-direction">Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN</li>
  <li>Now I am alone.</li>
  <li>O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!</li>
  <li class="number">Is it not monstrous that this player here,</li>
  <li>But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,</li>
  <li>Could force his soul so to his own conceit</li>
  <li>That from her working all his visage wann'd,</li>
  <li>Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,</li>
  <li class="number">A broken voice, and his whole function suiting</li>
  <li>With forms to his conceit? and all for nothing!</li>
  <li>For Hecuba!</li>
  <li>What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,</li>
  <li>That he should weep for her? What would he do,</li>
  <li class="number">Had he the motive and the cue for passion</li>
  <li>That I have? He would drown the stage with tears</li>
  <li>And cleave the general ear with horrid speech,</li>
  <li>Make mad the guilty and appal the free,</li>
  <li>Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed</li>
  <li class="number">The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,</li>
  <li>A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,</li>
  <li>Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,</li>
  <li>And can say nothing; no, not for a king,</li>
  <li>Upon whose property and most dear life</li>
  <li class="number">A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?</li>
  <li>Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?</li>
  <li>Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face?</li>
  <li>Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat,</li>
  <li>As deep as to the lungs? who does me this?</li>
  <li class="number">Ha!</li>
  <li>'Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be</li>
  <li>But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall</li>
  <li>To make oppression bitter, or ere this</li>
  <li>I should have fatted all the region kites</li>
  <li class="number">With this slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain!</li>
  <li>Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!</li>
  <li>O, vengeance!</li>
  <li>Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,</li>
  <li>That I, the son of a dear father murder'd,</li>
  <li class="number">Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,</li>
  <li>Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words,</li>
  <li>And fall a-cursing, like a very drab,</li>
  <li>A scullion!</li>
  <li>Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! I have heard</li>
  <li class="number">That guilty creatures sitting at a play</li>
  <li>Have by the very cunning of the scene</li>
  <li>Been struck so to the soul that presently</li>
  <li>They have proclaim'd their malefactions;</li>
  <li>For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak</li>
  <li class="number">With most miraculous organ. I'll have these players</li>
  <li>Play something like the murder of my father</li>
  <li>Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;</li>
  <li>I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,</li>
  <li>I know my course. The spirit that I have seen</li>
  <li class="number">May be the devil: and the devil hath power</li>
  <li>To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps</li>
  <li>Out of my weakness and my melancholy,</li>
  <li>As he is very potent with such spirits,</li>
  <li>Abuses me to damn me: I'll have grounds</li>
  <li class="number">More relative than this: the play 's the thing</li>
  <li>Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li>To be, or not to be: that is the question:</li>
  <li class="number">Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer</li>
  <li>The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,</li>
  <li>Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,</li>
  <li>And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;</li>
  <li>No more; and by a sleep to say we end</li>
  <li class="number">The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks</li>
  <li>That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation</li>
  <li>Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;</li>
  <li>To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;</li>
  <li>For in that sleep of death what dreams may come</li>
  <li class="number">When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,</li>
  <li>Must give us pause: there's the respect</li>
  <li>That makes calamity of so long life;</li>
  <li>For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,</li>
  <li>The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,</li>
  <li class="number">The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,</li>
  <li>The insolence of office and the spurns</li>
  <li>That patient merit of the unworthy takes,</li>
  <li>When he himself might his quietus make</li>
  <li>With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,</li>
  <li class="number">To grunt and sweat under a weary life,</li>
  <li>But that the dread of something after death,</li>
  <li>The undiscover'd country from whose bourn</li>
  <li>No traveller returns, puzzles the will</li>
  <li>And makes us rather bear those ills we have</li>
  <li class="number">Than fly to others that we know not of?</li>
  <li>Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;</li>
  <li>And thus the native hue of resolution</li>
  <li>Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,</li>
  <li>And enterprises of great pith and moment</li>
  <li class="number">With this regard their currents turn awry,</li>
  <li>And lose the name of action. — Soft you now!</li>
  <li>The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons</li>

  <li>transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the</li>
  <li>force of honesty can translate beauty into his</li>
  <li>likeness: this was sometime a paradox, but now the</li>

  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li>Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to</li>
  <li>you, trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it,</li>
  <li>as many of your players do, I had as lief the</li>
  <li>town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air</li>
  <li class="number">too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently;</li>
  <li>for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,</li>
  <li>the whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget</li>
  <li>a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it</li>
  <li>offends me to the soul to hear a robustious</li>
  <li class="number">periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to</li>
  <li>very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who</li>
  <li>for the most part are capable of nothing but</li>

  <li class="number">the modesty of nature: for any thing so overdone is</li>
  <li>from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the</li>
  <li>first and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the</li>
  <li>mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature,</li>
  <li>scorn her own image, and the very age and body of</li>
  <li class="number">the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone,</li>
  <li>or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful</li>
  <li>laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the</li>
  <li>censure of the which one must in your allowance</li>
  <li>o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be</li>
  <li class="number">players that I have seen play, and heard others</li>
  <li>praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely,</li>
  <li>that, neither having the accent of Christians nor</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li>Such an act</li>
  <li>That blurs the grace and blush of modesty,</li>
  <li>Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose</li>
  <li class="number">From the fair forehead of an innocent love</li>
  <li>And sets a blister there, makes marriage-vows</li>

  <li>The very soul, and sweet religion makes</li>
  <li class="number">A rhapsody of words: heaven's face doth glow:</li>
  <li>Yea, this solidity and compound mass,</li>

  <li class="speaker">QUEEN GERTRUDE</li>
  <li>Ay me, what act,</li>
  <li class="number">That roars so loud, and thunders in the index?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li>Look here, upon this picture, and on this,</li>
  <li>The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.</li>
  <li>See, what a grace was seated on this brow;</li>
  <li>Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;</li>
  <li class="number">An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;</li>
  <li>A station like the herald Mercury</li>
  <li>New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;</li>
  <li>A combination and a form indeed,</li>
  <li>Where every god did seem to set his seal,</li>
  <li class="number">To give the world assurance of a man:</li>
  <li>This was your husband. Look you now, what follows:</li>
  <li>Here is your husband; like a mildew'd ear,</li>
  <li>Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?</li>
  <li>Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,</li>
  <li class="number">And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?</li>
  <li>You cannot call it love; for at your age</li>
  <li>The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,</li>
  <li>And waits upon the judgment: and what judgment</li>
  <li>Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have,</li>
  <li class="number">Else could you not have motion; but sure, that sense</li>
  <li>Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,</li>
  <li>Nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrall'd</li>
  <li>But it reserved some quantity of choice,</li>
  <li>To serve in such a difference. What devil was't</li>
  <li class="number">That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?</li>
  <li>Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,</li>
  <li>Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,</li>
  <li>Or but a sickly part of one true sense</li>
  <li>Could not so mope.</li>
  <li class="number">O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,</li>
  <li>If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,</li>
  <li>To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,</li>
  <li>And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame</li>
  <li>When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,</li>
  <li class="number">Since frost itself as actively doth burn</li>
  <li>And reason panders will.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">QUEEN GERTRUDE</li>
  <li>O Hamlet, speak no more:</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li>Nay, but to live</li>

  <li>Over the nasty sty —  </li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">QUEEN GERTRUDE</li>
  <li class="number">O, speak to me no more;</li>

  <li>No more, sweet Hamlet!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li>A murderer and a villain;</li>
  <li>A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe</li>

  <li>Your bedded hair, like life in excrements,</li>
  <li class="number">Starts up, and stands on end. O gentle son,</li>
  <li>Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper</li>
  <li>Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li>On him, on him! Look you, how pale he glares!</li>
  <li>His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,</li>

  <li>Lest with this piteous action you convert</li>

  <li>Assume a virtue, if you have it not.</li>
  <li>That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat,</li>

  <li>And that shall lend a kind of easiness</li>
  <li>To the next abstinence: the next more easy;</li>
  <li>For use almost can change the stamp of nature,</li>
  <li class="number">And either ... the devil, or throw him out</li>
  <li>With wondrous potency. Once more, good night:</li>
  <li>And when you are desirous to be bless'd,</li>
  <li>I'll blessing beg of you. For this same lord,</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Pointing to POLONIUS</li>
  <li>I do repent: but heaven hath pleased it so,</li>
  <li class="number">To punish me with this and this with me,</li>

  <li>I will bestow him, and will answer well</li>
  <li>The death I gave him. So, again, good night.</li>
  <li>I must be cruel, only to be kind:</li>

  <li>And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,</li>
  <li>Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,</li>

  <li>That I essentially am not in madness,</li>

  <li>No, in despite of sense and secrecy,</li>
  <li class="number">Unpeg the basket on the house's top.</li>
  <li>Let the birds fly, and, like the famous ape,</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING CLAUDIUS</li>
  <li>Now must your conscience my acquaintance seal,</li>
  <li>And you must put me in your heart for friend,</li>
  <li>Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,</li>
  <li>That he which hath your noble father slain</li>
  <li class="number">Pursued my life.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LAERTES</li>
  <li>It well appears: but tell me</li>
  <li>Why you proceeded not against these feats,</li>
  <li>So crimeful and so capital in nature,</li>
  <li>As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,</li>
  <li class="number">You mainly were stirr'd up.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING CLAUDIUS</li>
  <li>O, for two special reasons;</li>
  <li>Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,</li>
  <li>But yet to me they are strong. The queen his mother</li>
  <li>Lives almost by his looks; and for myself — </li>
  <li class="number">My virtue or my plague, be it either which — </li>
  <li>She's so conjunctive to my life and soul,</li>
  <li>That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,</li>
  <li>I could not but by her. The other motive,</li>
  <li>Why to a public count I might not go,</li>
  <li class="number">Is the great love the general gender bear him;</li>
  <li>Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,</li>
  <li>Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,</li>
  <li>Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,</li>
  <li>Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,</li>
  <li class="number">Would have reverted to my bow again,</li>
  <li>And not where I had aim'd them.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LAERTES</li>

  <li>For her perfections: but my revenge will come.</li>

  <li>To thine own peace. If he be now return'd,</li>
  <li>As checking at his voyage, and that he means</li>
  <li>No more to undertake it, I will work him</li>
  <li>To an exploit, now ripe in my device,</li>
  <li class="number">Under the which he shall not choose but fall:</li>
  <li>And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,</li>
  <li>But even his mother shall uncharge the practise</li>
  <li>And call it accident.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LAERTES</li>
  <li>My lord, I will be ruled;</li>
  <li class="number">The rather, if you could devise it so</li>
  <li>That I might be the organ.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING CLAUDIUS</li>
  <li>It falls right.</li>
  <li>You have been talk'd of since your travel much,</li>
  <li>And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality</li>
  <li class="number">Wherein, they say, you shine: your sum of parts</li>
  <li>Did not together pluck such envy from him</li>
  <li>As did that one, and that, in my regard,</li>
  <li>Of the unworthiest siege.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LAERTES</li>
  <li>What part is that, my lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING CLAUDIUS</li>
  <li class="number">A very riband in the cap of youth,</li>
  <li>Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes</li>
  <li>The light and careless livery that it wears</li>
  <li>Than settled age his sables and his weeds,</li>
  <li>Importing health and graveness. Two months since,</li>
  <li class="number">Here was a gentleman of Normandy: — </li>
  <li>I've seen myself, and served against, the French,</li>
  <li>And they can well on horseback: but this gallant</li>
  <li>Had witchcraft in't; he grew unto his seat;</li>
  <li>And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,</li>
  <li class="number">As he had been incorpsed and demi-natured</li>
  <li>With the brave beast: so far he topp'd my thought,</li>
  <li>That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,</li>
  <li>Come short of what he did.</li>

<ol class="speech">

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING CLAUDIUS</li>
  <li class="number">He made confession of you,</li>
  <li>And gave you such a masterly report</li>

  <li>That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed,</li>
  <li class="number">If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation,</li>
  <li>He swore, had had neither motion, guard, nor eye,</li>
  <li>If you opposed them. Sir, this report of his</li>
  <li>Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy</li>
  <li>That he could nothing do but wish and beg</li>
  <li class="number">Your sudden coming o'er, to play with him.</li>
  <li>Now, out of this —  </li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LAERTES</li>
  <li>What out of this, my lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING CLAUDIUS</li>
  <li>Laertes, was your father dear to you?</li>
  <li>Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,</li>
  <li class="number">A face without a heart?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LAERTES</li>
  <li>Why ask you this?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING CLAUDIUS</li>
  <li>Not that I think you did not love your father;</li>
  <li>But that I know love is begun by time;</li>
  <li>And that I see, in passages of proof,</li>
  <li class="number">Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.</li>
  <li>There lives within the very flame of love</li>
  <li>A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;</li>
  <li>And nothing is at a like goodness still;</li>
  <li>For goodness, growing to a plurisy,</li>
  <li class="number">Dies in his own too much: that we would do</li>
  <li>We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes</li>
  <li>And hath abatements and delays as many</li>
  <li>As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;</li>
  <li>And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,</li>
  <li class="number">That hurts by easing. But, to the quick o' the ulcer: — </li>
  <li>Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake,</li>
  <li>To show yourself your father's son in deed</li>
  <li>More than in words?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LAERTES</li>
  <li>To cut his throat i' the church.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING CLAUDIUS</li>
  <li class="number">No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;</li>
  <li>Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,</li>
  <li>Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.</li>
  <li>Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home:</li>
  <li>We'll put on those shall praise your excellence</li>
  <li class="number">And set a double varnish on the fame</li>
  <li>The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together</li>
  <li>And wager on your heads: he, being remiss,</li>
  <li>Most generous and free from all contriving,</li>
  <li>Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease,</li>
  <li class="number">Or with a little shuffling, you may choose</li>
  <li>A sword unbated, and in a pass of practise</li>
  <li>Requite him for your father.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LAERTES</li>
  <li>I will do't:</li>
  <li>And, for that purpose, I'll anoint my sword.</li>
  <li class="number">I bought an unction of a mountebank,</li>
  <li>So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,</li>
  <li>Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,</li>
  <li>Collected from all simples that have virtue</li>
  <li>Under the moon, can save the thing from death</li>
  <li class="number">That is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point</li>
  <li>With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,</li>
  <li>It may be death.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING CLAUDIUS</li>
  <li>Let's further think of this;</li>
  <li>Weigh what convenience both of time and means</li>
  <li class="number">May fit us to our shape: if this should fail,</li>
  <li>And that our drift look through our bad performance,</li>
  <li>'Twere better not assay'd: therefore this project</li>
  <li>Should have a back or second, that might hold,</li>
  <li>If this should blast in proof. Soft! let me see:</li>
  <li class="number">We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings: I ha't.</li>
  <li>When in your motion you are hot and dry — </li>
  <li>As make your bouts more violent to that end — </li>
  <li>And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepared him</li>

  <li class="number">That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,</li>
  <li>But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them:</li>

  <li>When down her weedy trophies and herself</li>
  <li class="number">Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide;</li>
  <li>And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up:</li>
  <li>Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes;</li>
  <li>As one incapable of her own distress,</li>

  <li class="speaker">First Clown</li>
  <li>Is she to be buried in Christian burial that</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Clown</li>
  <li>I tell thee she is: and therefore make her grave</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Clown</li>
  <li>How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Clown</li>
  <li>Why, 'tis found so.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Clown</li>
  <li>It must be 'se offendendo;' it cannot be else. For</li>
  <li class="number">here lies the point:  if I drown myself wittingly,</li>
  <li>it argues an act: and an act hath three branches: it</li>
  <li>is, to act, to do, to perform: argal, she drowned</li>
  <li>herself wittingly.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Clown</li>
  <li>Nay, but hear you, goodman delver —  </li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Clown</li>
  <li class="number">Give me leave. Here lies the water; good: here</li>
  <li>stands the man; good; if the man go to this water,</li>
  <li>and drown himself, it is, will he, nill he, he</li>
  <li>goes —  mark you that; but if the water come to him</li>
  <li>and drown him, he drowns not himself: argal, he</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Clown</li>
  <li>Why, there thou say'st: and the more pity that</li>

  <li>drown or hang themselves, more than their even</li>
  <li>Christian. Come, my spade. There is no ancient</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter HAMLET and HORATIO</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li>So much for this, sir: now shall you see the other;</li>
  <li>You do remember all the circumstance?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HORATIO</li>
  <li>Remember it, my lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li>Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting,</li>
  <li class="number">That would not let me sleep: methought I lay</li>
  <li>Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly,</li>
  <li>And praised be rashness for it, let us know,</li>
  <li>Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well,</li>
  <li>When our deep plots do pall: and that should teach us</li>
  <li class="number">There's a divinity that shapes our ends,</li>
  <li>Rough-hew them how we will —  </li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HORATIO</li>
  <li>That is most certain.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li>Up from my cabin,</li>
  <li>My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark</li>
  <li class="number">Groped I to find out them; had my desire.</li>
  <li>Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew</li>
  <li>To mine own room again; making so bold,</li>
  <li>My fears forgetting manners, to unseal</li>
  <li>Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio —  </li>
  <li class="number">O royal knavery! — an exact command,</li>
  <li>Larded with many several sorts of reasons</li>
  <li>Importing Denmark's health and England's too,</li>
  <li>With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,</li>
  <li>That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,</li>
  <li class="number">No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,</li>
  <li>My head should be struck off.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HORATIO</li>
  <li>Is't possible?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li>Here's the commission: read it at more leisure.</li>
  <li>But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HORATIO</li>
  <li class="number">I beseech you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li>Being thus be-netted round with villanies —  </li>
  <li>Ere I could make a prologue to my brains,</li>
  <li>They had begun the play — I sat me down,</li>
  <li>Devised a new commission, wrote it fair:</li>
  <li class="number">I once did hold it, as our statists do,</li>
  <li>A baseness to write fair and labour'd much</li>
  <li>How to forget that learning, but, sir, now</li>
  <li>It did me yeoman's service: wilt thou know</li>
  <li>The effect of what I wrote?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HORATIO</li>
  <li class="number">Ay, good my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li>An earnest conjuration from the king,</li>
  <li>As England was his faithful tributary,</li>
  <li>As love between them like the palm might flourish,</li>
  <li>As peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear</li>
  <li class="number">And stand a comma 'tween their amities,</li>
  <li>And many such-like 'As'es of great charge,</li>
  <li>That, on the view and knowing of these contents,</li>
  <li>Without debatement further, more or less,</li>
  <li>He should the bearers put to sudden death,</li>
  <li class="number">Not shriving-time allow'd.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HORATIO</li>
  <li>How was this seal'd?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li>Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.</li>
  <li>I had my father's signet in my purse,</li>
  <li>Which was the model of that Danish seal;</li>
  <li class="number">Folded the writ up in form of the other,</li>
  <li>Subscribed it, gave't the impression, placed it safely,</li>
  <li>The changeling never known. Now, the next day</li>
  <li>Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent</li>
  <li>Thou know'st already.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HORATIO</li>
  <li class="number">So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li>Why, man, they did make love to this employment;</li>
  <li>They are not near my conscience; their defeat</li>
  <li>Does by their own insinuation grow:</li>
  <li>'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes</li>
  <li class="number">Between the pass and fell incensed points</li>
  <li>Of mighty opposites.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HORATIO</li>
  <li>Why, what a king is this!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li>Does it not, think'st thee, stand me now upon — </li>
  <li>He that hath kill'd my king and whored my mother,</li>
  <li class="number">Popp'd in between the election and my hopes,</li>
  <li>Thrown out his angle for my proper life,</li>
  <li>And with such cozenage — is't not perfect conscience,</li>
  <li>To quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd,</li>
  <li>To let this canker of our nature come</li>
  <li class="number">In further evil?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HORATIO</li>
  <li>It must be shortly known to him from England</li>
  <li>What is the issue of the business there.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li>It will be short: the interim is mine;</li>
  <li>And a man's life's no more than to say 'One.'</li>
  <li class="number">But I am very sorry, good Horatio,</li>
  <li>That to Laertes I forgot myself;</li>
  <li>For, by the image of my cause, I see</li>
  <li>The portraiture of his: I'll court his favours.</li>
  <li>But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me</li>
  <li class="number">Into a towering passion.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">

  <li class="number">Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith.</li>
  <li>Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe</li>
  <li>me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent</li>
  <li>differences, of very soft society and great showing:</li>
  <li>indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or</li>

  <li>continent of what part a gentleman would see.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HAMLET</li>
  <li>Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;</li>
  <li>though, I know, to divide him inventorially would</li>
  <li>dizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw</li>
  <li class="number">neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the</li>
  <li>verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of</li>
  <li>great article; and his infusion of such dearth and</li>
  <li>rareness, as, to make true diction of him, his</li>
  <li>semblable is his mirror; and who else would trace</li>
  <li class="number">him, his umbrage, nothing more.</li>

  <li>assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so: three of the</li>
  <li>carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very</li>

  <li>against six French swords, their assigns, and three</li>
