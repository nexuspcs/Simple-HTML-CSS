<h3>SCENE I.  Antioch. A room in the palace.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter ANTIOCHUS, Prince PERICLES, and followers</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ANTIOCHUS</li>
  <li>Young prince of Tyre, you have at large received</li>
  <li>The danger of the task you undertake.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PERICLES</li>
  <li>I have, Antiochus, and, with a soul</li>
  <li>Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,</li>
  <li class="number">Think death no hazard in this enterprise.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ANTIOCHUS</li>
  <li>Bring in our daughter, clothed like a bride,</li>
  <li>For the embracements even of Jove himself;</li>
  <li>At whose conception, till Lucina reign'd,</li>
  <li>Nature this dowry gave, to glad her presence,</li>
  <li class="number">The senate-house of planets all did sit,</li>
  <li>To knit in her their best perfections.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Music. Enter the Daughter of ANTIOCHUS</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PERICLES</li>
  <li>See where she comes, apparell'd like the spring,</li>
  <li>Graces her subjects, and her thoughts the king</li>
  <li>Of every virtue gives renown to men!</li>
  <li class="number">Her face the book of praises, where is read</li>
  <li>Nothing but curious pleasures, as from thence</li>
  <li>Sorrow were ever razed and testy wrath</li>
  <li>Could never be her mild companion.</li>
  <li>You gods that made me man, and sway in love,</li>
  <li class="number">That have inflamed desire in my breast</li>
  <li>To taste the fruit of yon celestial tree,</li>
  <li>Or die in the adventure, be my helps,</li>
  <li>As I am son and servant to your will,</li>
  <li>To compass such a boundless happiness!</li>

  <li class="number">Prince Pericles —  </li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PERICLES</li>
  <li>That would be son to great Antiochus.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ANTIOCHUS</li>
  <li>Before thee stands this fair Hesperides,</li>
  <li>With golden fruit, but dangerous to be touch'd;</li>
  <li>For death-like dragons here affright thee hard:</li>
  <li class="number">Her face, like heaven, enticeth thee to view</li>
  <li>Her countless glory, which desert must gain;</li>
  <li>And which, without desert, because thine eye</li>
  <li>Presumes to reach, all thy whole heap must die.</li>
  <li>Yon sometimes famous princes, like thyself,</li>
  <li class="number">Drawn by report, adventurous by desire,</li>
  <li>Tell thee, with speechless tongues and semblance pale,</li>
  <li>That without covering, save yon field of stars,</li>
  <li>Here they stand martyrs, slain in Cupid's wars;</li>
  <li>And with dead cheeks advise thee to desist</li>
  <li class="number">For going on death's net, whom none resist.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PERICLES</li>
  <li>Antiochus, I thank thee, who hath taught</li>
  <li>My frail mortality to know itself,</li>
  <li>And by those fearful objects to prepare</li>
  <li>This body, like to them, to what I must;</li>
  <li class="number">For death remember'd should be like a mirror,</li>
  <li>Who tells us life's but breath, to trust it error.</li>
  <li>I'll make my will then, and, as sick men do</li>
  <li>Who know the world, see heaven, but, feeling woe,</li>
  <li>Gripe not at earthly joys as erst they did;</li>
  <li class="number">So I bequeath a happy peace to you</li>
  <li>And all good men, as every prince should do;</li>
  <li>My riches to the earth from whence they came;</li>
  <li>But my unspotted fire of love to you.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">To the Daughter of ANTIOCHUS</li>
  <li>Thus ready for the way of life or death,</li>
  <li class="number">I wait the sharpest blow, Antiochus.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ANTIOCHUS</li>
  <li>Scorning advice, read the conclusion then:</li>
  <li>Which read and not expounded, 'tis decreed,</li>
  <li>As these before thee thou thyself shalt bleed.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Daughter</li>
  <li>Of all say'd yet, mayst thou prove prosperous!</li>
  <li class="number">Of all say'd yet, I wish thee happiness!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PERICLES</li>
  <li>Like a bold champion, I assume the lists,</li>
  <li>Nor ask advice of any other thought</li>
  <li>But faithfulness and courage.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">He reads the riddle</li>
  <li>I am no viper, yet I feed</li>
  <li class="number">On mother's flesh which did me breed.</li>
  <li>I sought a husband, in which labour</li>
  <li>I found that kindness in a father:</li>
  <li>He's father, son, and husband mild;</li>
  <li>I mother, wife, and yet his child.</li>
  <li class="number">How they may be, and yet in two,</li>
  <li>As you will live, resolve it you.</li>
  <li>Sharp physic is the last: but, O you powers</li>
  <li>That give heaven countless eyes to view men's acts,</li>
  <li>Why cloud they not their sights perpetually,</li>
  <li class="number">If this be true, which makes me pale to read it?</li>
  <li>Fair glass of light, I loved you, and could still,</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Takes hold of the hand of the Daughter of ANTIOCHUS</li>
  <li>Were not this glorious casket stored with ill:</li>
  <li>But I must tell you, now my thoughts revolt</li>
  <li>For he's no man on whom perfections wait</li>
  <li class="number">That, knowing sin within, will touch the gate.</li>
  <li>You are a fair viol, and your sense the strings;</li>
  <li>Who, finger'd to make man his lawful music,</li>
  <li>Would draw heaven down, and all the gods, to hearken:</li>
  <li>But being play'd upon before your time,</li>
  <li class="number">Hell only danceth at so harsh a chime.</li>
  <li>Good sooth, I care not for you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ANTIOCHUS</li>
  <li>Prince Pericles, touch not, upon thy life.</li>
  <li>For that's an article within our law,</li>
  <li>As dangerous as the rest. Your time's expired:</li>
  <li class="number">Either expound now, or receive your sentence.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PERICLES</li>
  <li>Great king,</li>
  <li>Few love to hear the sins they love to act;</li>
  <li>'Twould braid yourself too near for me to tell it.</li>
  <li>Who has a book of all that monarchs do,</li>
  <li class="number">He's more secure to keep it shut than shown:</li>
  <li>For vice repeated is like the wandering wind.</li>
  <li>Blows dust in other's eyes, to spread itself;</li>
  <li>And yet the end of all is bought thus dear,</li>
  <li>The breath is gone, and the sore eyes see clear:</li>
  <li class="number">To stop the air would hurt them. The blind mole casts</li>
  <li>Copp'd hills towards heaven, to tell the earth is throng'd</li>
  <li>By man's oppression; and the poor worm doth die for't.</li>
  <li>Kings are earth's gods; in vice their law's</li>
  <li>their will;</li>
  <li class="number">And if Jove stray, who dares say Jove doth ill?</li>
  <li>It is enough you know; and it is fit,</li>
  <li>What being more known grows worse, to smother it.</li>
  <li>All love the womb that their first being bred,</li>
  <li>Then give my tongue like leave to love my head.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ANTIOCHUS</li>
  <li class="number">Aside  Heaven, that I had thy head! he has found</li>
  <li>the meaning:</li>
  <li>But I will gloze with him. — Young prince of Tyre,</li>
  <li>Though by the tenor of our strict edict,</li>
  <li>Your exposition misinterpreting,</li>
  <li class="number">We might proceed to cancel of your days;</li>
  <li>Yet hope, succeeding from so fair a tree</li>
  <li>As your fair self, doth tune us otherwise:</li>
  <li>Forty days longer we do respite you;</li>
  <li>If by which time our secret be undone,</li>
  <li class="number">This mercy shows we'll joy in such a son:</li>
  <li>And until then your entertain shall be</li>
  <li>As doth befit our honour and your worth.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt all but PERICLES</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PERICLES</li>
  <li>How courtesy would seem to cover sin,</li>
  <li>When what is done is like an hypocrite,</li>
  <li class="number">The which is good in nothing but in sight!</li>
  <li>If it be true that I interpret false,</li>
  <li>Then were it certain you were not so bad</li>
  <li>As with foul incest to abuse your soul;</li>
  <li>Where now you're both a father and a son,</li>
  <li class="number">By your untimely claspings with your child,</li>
  <li>Which pleasure fits an husband, not a father;</li>
  <li>And she an eater of her mother's flesh,</li>
  <li>By the defiling of her parent's bed;</li>
  <li>And both like serpents are, who though they feed</li>
  <li class="number">On sweetest flowers, yet they poison breed.</li>
  <li>Antioch, farewell! for wisdom sees, those men</li>
  <li>Blush not in actions blacker than the night,</li>
  <li>Will shun no course to keep them from the light.</li>
  <li>One sin, I know, another doth provoke;</li>
  <li class="number">Murder's as near to lust as flame to smoke:</li>
  <li>Poison and treason are the hands of sin,</li>
  <li>Ay, and the targets, to put off the shame:</li>
  <li>Then, lest my lie be cropp'd to keep you clear,</li>
  <li>By flight I'll shun the danger which I fear.</li>

  <li class="speaker">PERICLES</li>
  <li>To Lords without  Let none disturb us. — Why should</li>
  <li>this change of thoughts,</li>
  <li>The sad companion, dull-eyed melancholy,</li>
  <li>Be my so used a guest as not an hour,</li>
  <li class="number">In the day's glorious walk, or peaceful night,</li>
  <li>The tomb where grief should sleep, can breed me quiet?</li>
  <li>Here pleasures court mine eyes, and mine eyes shun them,</li>
  <li>And danger, which I fear'd, is at Antioch,</li>
  <li>Whose aim seems far too short to hit me here:</li>
  <li class="number">Yet neither pleasure's art can joy my spirits,</li>
  <li>Nor yet the other's distance comfort me.</li>
  <li>Then it is thus: the passions of the mind,</li>
  <li>That have their first conception by mis-dread,</li>
  <li>Have after-nourishment and life by care;</li>
  <li class="number">And what was first but fear what might be done,</li>
  <li>Grows elder now and cares it be not done.</li>
  <li>And so with me: the great Antiochus,</li>
  <li>'Gainst whom I am too little to contend,</li>
  <li>Since he's so great can make his will his act,</li>
  <li class="number">Will think me speaking, though I swear to silence;</li>
  <li>Nor boots it me to say I honour him.</li>
  <li>If he suspect I may dishonour him:</li>

  <li>He'll stop the course by which it might be known;</li>
  <li class="number">With hostile forces he'll o'erspread the land,</li>
  <li>And with the ostent of war will look so huge,</li>
  <li>Amazement shall drive courage from the state;</li>
  <li>Our men be vanquish'd ere they do resist,</li>
  <li>And subjects punish'd that ne'er thought offence:</li>
  <li class="number">Which care of them, not pity of myself,</li>
  <li>Who am no more but as the tops of trees,</li>
  <li>Which fence the roots they grow by and defend them,</li>

  <li class="number">When all, for mine, if I may call offence,</li>

  <li class="number">being bid to ask what he would of the king, desired</li>
  <li>he might know none of his secrets: now do I see he</li>

  <li>O my distressed lord, even such our griefs are;</li>

  <li>Our tongues and sorrows do sound deep</li>
  <li>Our woes into the air; our eyes do weep,</li>
  <li class="number">Till tongues fetch breath that may proclaim them louder;</li>
  <li>That, if heaven slumber while their creatures want,</li>

  <li>Although they gave their creatures in abundance,</li>

  <li>Those palates who, not yet two summers younger,</li>

  <li>Would now be glad of bread, and beg for it:</li>
  <li>Those mothers who, to nousle up their babes,</li>

  <li>To eat those little darlings whom they loved.</li>
  <li class="number">So sharp are hunger's teeth, that man and wife</li>

  <li class="speaker">First Fisherman</li>
  <li>Why, as men do a-land; the great ones eat up the</li>

  <li>last devours them all at a mouthful: such whales</li>

  <li>Come, give me your flowers, ere the sea mar it.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MARINA</li>
  <li>My father, as nurse said, did never fear,</li>

  <li>His kingly hands, haling ropes;</li>
  <li>And, clasping to the mast, endured a sea</li>

  <li class="speaker">MARINA</li>
  <li class="number">When I was born:</li>
  <li>Never was waves nor wind more violent;</li>
  <li>And from the ladder-tackle washes off</li>
  <li>A canvas-climber. 'Ha!' says one, 'wilt out?'</li>
  <li>And with a dropping industry they skip</li>
  <li class="number">From stem to stern: the boatswain whistles, and</li>
  <li>The master calls, and trebles their confusion.</li>

  <li>I never spake bad word, nor did ill turn</li>
  <li>To any living creature: believe me, la,</li>
  <li class="number">I never kill'd a mouse, nor hurt a fly:</li>
  <li>I trod upon a worm against my will,</li>

  <li>You will not do't for all the world, I hope.</li>

  <li>Search the market narrowly; Mytilene is full of</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Bawd</li>
  <li>We were never so much out of creatures. We have but</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Bawd</li>
  <li>Well, well; as for him, he brought his disease</li>

  <li>willingly, despise profit where you have most gain.</li>
  <li>To weep that you live as ye do makes pity in your</li>
  <li>lovers: seldom but that pity begets you a good</li>

  <li class="speaker">Bawd</li>
  <li>Thou sayest true, i' faith, so they must; for your</li>

  <li>Were I chief lord of all this spacious world,</li>

  <li>To equal any single crown o' the earth</li>
  <li class="number">I' the justice of compare! O villain Leonine!</li>
  <li>Whom thou hast poison'd too:</li>

  <li>When noble Pericles shall demand his child?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DIONYZA</li>

  <li>She did disdain my child, and stood between</li>

  <li class="number">By you being pardon'd, we commit no crime</li>

  <li>The stages of our story. Pericles</li>

  <li>Advanced in time to great and high estate,</li>
  <li class="number">Is left to govern. Bear you it in mind,</li>
  <li>Old Helicanus goes along behind.</li>
  <li>Well-sailing ships and bounteous winds have brought</li>
  <li>This king to Tarsus —  think his pilot thought;</li>
  <li>So with his steerage shall your thoughts grow on —  </li>
  <li class="number">To fetch his daughter home, who first is gone.</li>
  <li>Like motes and shadows see them move awhile;</li>
  <li>Your ears unto your eyes I'll reconcile.</li>
  <li class="subhead">DUMB SHOW.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Enter PERICLES, at one door, with all his train;
CLEON and DIONYZA, at the other. CLEON shows
PERICLES the tomb; whereat PERICLES makes
lamentation, puts on sackcloth, and in a mighty
passion departs. Then exeunt CLEON and DIONYZA</li>
  <li>See how belief may suffer by foul show!</li>
  <li>This borrow'd passion stands for true old woe;</li>
  <li class="number">And Pericles, in sorrow all devour'd,</li>
  <li>With sighs shot through, and biggest tears</li>
  <li>o'ershower'd,</li>
  <li>Leaves Tarsus and again embarks. He swears</li>
  <li>Never to wash his face, nor cut his hairs:</li>
  <li class="number">He puts on sackcloth, and to sea. He bears</li>
  <li>A tempest, which his mortal vessel tears,</li>
  <li>And yet he rides it out. Now please you wit.</li>
  <li>The epitaph is for Marina writ</li>
  <li>By wicked Dionyza.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Reads the inscription on MARINA's monument</li>
  <li class="number">'The fairest, sweet'st, and best lies here,</li>

  <li>Marina was she call'd; and at her birth,</li>

  <li>Wherefore she does, and swears she'll never stint,</li>
  <li>Make raging battery upon shores of flint.'</li>
  <li class="number">No visor does become black villany</li>

<ol class="speech">

  <li>O'erbear the shores of my mortality,</li>

  <li>Thaisa was my mother, who did end</li>
  <li>The minute I began.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PERICLES</li>

  <li class="speaker">PERICLES</li>
  <li>Hail, Dian! to perform thy just command,</li>
  <li>I here confess myself the king of Tyre;</li>
  <li>Who, frighted from my country, did wed</li>
  <li>At Pentapolis the fair Thaisa.</li>
  <li class="number">At sea in childbed died she, but brought forth</li>
  <li>A maid-child call'd Marina; who, O goddess,</li>
  <li>Wears yet thy silver livery. She at Tarsus</li>
  <li>Was nursed with Cleon; who at fourteen years</li>
  <li>He sought to murder: but her better stars</li>
  <li class="number">Brought her to Mytilene; 'gainst whose shore</li>
  <li>Riding, her fortunes brought the maid aboard us,</li>
  <li>Where, by her own most clear remembrance, she</li>
  <li>Made known herself my daughter.</li>

  <li>Look to the lady; O, she's but o'erjoy'd.</li>
  <li class="number">Early in blustering morn this lady was</li>
  <li>Thrown upon this shore. I oped the coffin,</li>
  <li>Found there rich jewels; recover'd her, and placed her</li>
