LENNOX, with Attendants, meeting a bleeding Sergeant</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DUNCAN</li>
  <li>What bloody man is that? He can report,</li>
  <li>As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MALCOLM</li>
  <li>This is the sergeant</li>

  <li>Say to the king the knowledge of the broil</li>
  <li>As thou didst leave it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Sergeant</li>
  <li>Doubtful it stood;</li>
  <li class="number">As two spent swimmers, that do cling together</li>
  <li>And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald — </li>
  <li>Worthy to be a rebel, for to that</li>
  <li>The multiplying villanies of nature</li>
  <li>Do swarm upon him — from the western isles</li>
  <li class="number">Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;</li>
  <li>And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,</li>
  <li>Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:</li>
  <li>For brave Macbeth — well he deserves that name — </li>
  <li>Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,</li>
  <li class="number">Which smoked with bloody execution,</li>
  <li>Like valour's minion carved out his passage</li>
  <li>Till he faced the slave;</li>
  <li>Which ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,</li>
  <li>Till he unseam'd him from the nave to the chaps,</li>
  <li class="number">And fix'd his head upon our battlements.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DUNCAN</li>
  <li>O valiant cousin! worthy gentleman!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Sergeant</li>
  <li>As whence the sun 'gins his reflection</li>
  <li>Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break,</li>
  <li>So from that spring whence comfort seem'd to come</li>
  <li class="number">Discomfort swells. Mark, king of Scotland, mark:</li>
  <li>No sooner justice had with valour arm'd</li>
  <li>Compell'd these skipping kerns to trust their heels,</li>
  <li>But the Norweyan lord surveying vantage,</li>
  <li>With furbish'd arms and new supplies of men</li>
  <li class="number">Began a fresh assault.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DUNCAN</li>
  <li>Dismay'd not this</li>
  <li>Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Sergeant</li>
  <li>Yes;</li>
  <li>As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.</li>
  <li class="number">If I say sooth, I must report they were</li>
  <li>As cannons overcharged with double cracks, so they</li>
  <li>Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe:</li>
  <li>Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,</li>
  <li>Or memorise another Golgotha,</li>
  <li class="number">I cannot tell.</li>
  <li>But I am faint, my gashes cry for help.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DUNCAN</li>
  <li>So well thy words become thee as thy wounds;</li>
  <li>They smack of honour both. Go get him surgeons.</li>

  <li>Who comes here?</li>

  <li class="speaker">ROSS</li>
  <li>God save the king!</li>

  <li>Whence camest thou, worthy thane?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSS</li>
  <li class="number">From Fife, great king;</li>
  <li>Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky</li>
  <li>And fan our people cold. Norway himself,</li>
  <li>With terrible numbers,</li>
  <li>Assisted by that most disloyal traitor</li>
  <li class="number">The thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict;</li>
  <li>Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapp'd in proof,</li>
  <li>Confronted him with self-comparisons,</li>
  <li>Point against point rebellious, arm 'gainst arm.</li>
  <li>Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,</li>
  <li class="number">The victory fell on us.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DUNCAN</li>
  <li>Great happiness!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSS</li>
  <li>That now</li>
  <li>Sweno, the Norways' king, craves composition:</li>
  <li>Nor would we deign him burial of his men</li>
  <li class="number">Till he disbursed at Saint Colme's inch</li>
  <li>Ten thousand dollars to our general use.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DUNCAN</li>
  <li>No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceive</li>
  <li>Our bosom interest: go pronounce his present death,</li>
  <li>And with his former title greet Macbeth.</li>

  <li>By Sinel's death I know I am thane of Glamis;</li>

  <li class="number">A prosperous gentleman; and to be king</li>
  <li>Stands not within the prospect of belief,</li>
  <li>No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence</li>

  <li>Which should be thine or his: silenced with that,</li>
  <li>In viewing o'er the rest o' the selfsame day,</li>
  <li>He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,</li>
  <li>Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,</li>
  <li class="number">Strange images of death. As thick as hail</li>
  <li>Came post with post; and every one did bear</li>

  <li>With hidden help and vantage, or that with both</li>
  <li class="number">He labour'd in his country's wreck, I know not;</li>

  <li class="speaker">BANQUO</li>
  <li>That trusted home</li>

  <li>Cannot be ill, cannot be good: if ill,</li>
  <li>Why hath it given me earnest of success,</li>
  <li>Commencing in a truth? I am thane of Cawdor:</li>
  <li>If good, why do I yield to that suggestion</li>
  <li class="number">Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair</li>

  <li>'They met me in the day of success: and I have</li>
  <li>learned by the perfectest report, they have more in</li>
  <li>them than mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire</li>
  <li>to question them further, they made themselves air,</li>
  <li class="number">into which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in</li>
  <li>the wonder of it, came missives from the king, who</li>
  <li>all-hailed me 'Thane of Cawdor;' by which title,</li>
  <li>before, these weird sisters saluted me, and referred</li>
  <li>me to the coming on of time, with 'Hail, king that</li>
  <li class="number">shalt be!' This have I thought good to deliver</li>
  <li>thee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thou</li>
  <li>mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being</li>
  <li>ignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it</li>
  <li>to thy heart, and farewell.'</li>
  <li class="number">Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be</li>
  <li>What thou art promised: yet do I fear thy nature;</li>
  <li>It is too full o' the milk of human kindness</li>
  <li>To catch the nearest way: thou wouldst be great;</li>
  <li>Art not without ambition, but without</li>
  <li class="number">The illness should attend it: what thou wouldst highly,</li>
  <li>That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,</li>
  <li>And yet wouldst wrongly win: thou'ldst have, great Glamis,</li>
  <li>That which cries 'Thus thou must do, if thou have it;</li>
  <li>And that which rather thou dost fear to do</li>
  <li class="number">Than wishest should be undone.' Hie thee hither,</li>
  <li>That I may pour my spirits in thine ear;</li>
  <li>And chastise with the valour of my tongue</li>
  <li>All that impedes thee from the golden round,</li>

  <li>And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full</li>

  <li>That no compunctious visitings of nature</li>

  <li>You wait on nature's mischief! Come, thick night,</li>

  <li>With his surcease success; that but this blow</li>

  <li>A limbeck only: when in swinish sleep</li>

  <li>What cannot you and I perform upon</li>

  <li class="number">And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,</li>
  <li>He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour</li>
  <li>To act in safety. There is none but he</li>
  <li>Whose being I do fear: and, under him,</li>
  <li>My Genius is rebuked; as, it is said,</li>
  <li class="number">Mark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the sisters</li>
  <li>When first they put the name of king upon me,</li>

  <li>They hail'd him father to a line of kings:</li>
  <li>Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown,</li>
  <li class="number">And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,</li>
  <li>Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,</li>
  <li>No son of mine succeeding. If 't be so,</li>
  <li>For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind;</li>
  <li>For them the gracious Duncan have I murder'd;</li>
  <li class="number">Put rancours in the vessel of my peace</li>
  <li>Only for them; and mine eternal jewel</li>
  <li>Given to the common enemy of man,</li>
  <li>To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!</li>

  <li class="number">And champion me to the utterance! Who's there!</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MACBETH</li>
  <li>Well then, now</li>
  <li class="number">Have you consider'd of my speeches? Know</li>
  <li>That it was he in the times past which held you</li>
  <li>So under fortune, which you thought had been</li>
  <li>Our innocent self: this I made good to you</li>
  <li>In our last conference, pass'd in probation with you,</li>
  <li class="number">How you were borne in hand, how cross'd,</li>
  <li>the instruments,</li>
  <li>Who wrought with them, and all things else that might</li>
  <li>To half a soul and to a notion crazed</li>
  <li>Say 'Thus did Banquo.'</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Murderer</li>
  <li class="number">You made it known to us.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MACBETH</li>
  <li>I did so, and went further, which is now</li>
  <li>Our point of second meeting. Do you find</li>
  <li>Your patience so predominant in your nature</li>
  <li>That you can let this go? Are you so gospell'd</li>
  <li class="number">To pray for this good man and for his issue,</li>
  <li>Whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the grave</li>
  <li>And beggar'd yours for ever?</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MACBETH</li>
  <li>Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men;</li>
  <li class="number">As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,</li>
  <li>Shoughs, water-rugs and demi-wolves, are clept</li>
  <li>All by the name of dogs: the valued file</li>
  <li>Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,</li>
  <li>The housekeeper, the hunter, every one</li>
  <li class="number">According to the gift which bounteous nature</li>
  <li>Hath in him closed; whereby he does receive</li>
  <li>Particular addition. from the bill</li>
  <li>That writes them all alike: and so of men.</li>
  <li>Now, if you have a station in the file,</li>
  <li class="number">Not i' the worst rank of manhood, say 't;</li>
  <li>And I will put that business in your bosoms,</li>
  <li>Whose execution takes your enemy off,</li>
  <li>Grapples you to the heart and love of us,</li>
  <li>Who wear our health but sickly in his life,</li>
  <li class="number">Which in his death were perfect.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Murderer</li>
  <li>I am one, my liege,</li>
  <li>Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world</li>
  <li>Have so incensed that I am reckless what</li>
  <li>I do to spite the world.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Murderer</li>
  <li class="number">And I another</li>
  <li>So weary with disasters, tugg'd with fortune,</li>
  <li>That I would set my lie on any chance,</li>
  <li>To mend it, or be rid on't.</li>
</ol>

  <li class="speaker">Both Murderers</li>
  <li>True, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MACBETH</li>
  <li>So is he mine; and in such bloody distance,</li>
  <li>That every minute of his being thrusts</li>
  <li>Against my near'st of life: and though I could</li>
  <li class="number">With barefaced power sweep him from my sight</li>
  <li>And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,</li>
  <li>For certain friends that are both his and mine,</li>
  <li>Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall</li>
  <li>Who I myself struck down; and thence it is,</li>
  <li class="number">That I to your assistance do make love,</li>
  <li>Masking the business from the common eye</li>
  <li>For sundry weighty reasons.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">

  <li>Fleance his son, that keeps him company,</li>
  <li>Whose absence is no less material to me</li>

  <li class="speaker">LENNOX</li>
  <li>My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,</li>
  <li>Which can interpret further: only, I say,</li>
  <li>Things have been strangely borne. The</li>
  <li>gracious Duncan</li>
  <li class="number">Was pitied of Macbeth: marry, he was dead:</li>
  <li>And the right-valiant Banquo walk'd too late;</li>
  <li>Whom, you may say, if't please you, Fleance kill'd,</li>
  <li>For Fleance fled: men must not walk too late.</li>
  <li>Who cannot want the thought how monstrous</li>
  <li class="number">It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain</li>
  <li>To kill their gracious father? damned fact!</li>
  <li>How it did grieve Macbeth! did he not straight</li>
  <li>In pious rage the two delinquents tear,</li>
  <li>That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?</li>
  <li class="number">Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too;</li>
  <li>For 'twould have anger'd any heart alive</li>
  <li>To hear the men deny't. So that, I say,</li>
  <li>He has borne all things well: and I do think</li>
  <li>That had he Duncan's sons under his key — </li>
  <li class="number">As, an't please heaven, he shall not — they</li>
  <li>should find</li>
  <li>What 'twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.</li>
  <li>But, peace! for from broad words and 'cause he fail'd</li>
  <li>His presence at the tyrant's feast, I hear</li>
  <li class="number">Macduff lives in disgrace: sir, can you tell</li>
  <li>Where he bestows himself?</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Lord</li>
  <li>The son of Duncan,</li>
  <li>From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth</li>
  <li>Lives in the English court, and is received</li>
  <li class="number">Of the most pious Edward with such grace</li>
  <li>That the malevolence of fortune nothing</li>
  <li>Takes from his high respect: thither Macduff</li>
  <li>Is gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid</li>
  <li>To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward:</li>
  <li class="number">That, by the help of these — with Him above</li>
  <li>To ratify the work — we may again</li>
  <li>Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights,</li>
  <li>Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,</li>
  <li>Do faithful homage and receive free honours:</li>
  <li class="number">All which we pine for now: and this report</li>
  <li>Hath so exasperate the king that he</li>
  <li>Prepares for some attempt of war.</li>

  <li>Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin</li>
  <li>That has a name: but there's no bottom, none,</li>
  <li>In my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters,</li>
  <li>Your matrons and your maids, could not fill up</li>
  <li class="number">The cistern of my lust, and my desire</li>
  <li>All continent impediments would o'erbear</li>
  <li>That did oppose my will: better Macbeth</li>
  <li>Than such an one to reign.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MACDUFF</li>
  <li>Boundless intemperance</li>
  <li class="number">In nature is a tyranny; it hath been</li>
  <li>The untimely emptying of the happy throne</li>
  <li>And fall of many kings. But fear not yet</li>
  <li>To take upon you what is yours: you may</li>
  <li>Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,</li>
  <li class="number">And yet seem cold, the time you may so hoodwink.</li>
  <li>We have willing dames enough: there cannot be</li>
  <li>That vulture in you, to devour so many</li>
  <li>As will to greatness dedicate themselves,</li>
  <li>Finding it so inclined.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MALCOLM</li>
  <li class="number">With this there grows</li>
  <li>In my most ill-composed affection such</li>
  <li>A stanchless avarice that, were I king,</li>
  <li>I should cut off the nobles for their lands,</li>
  <li>Desire his jewels and this other's house:</li>
  <li class="number">And my more-having would be as a sauce</li>
  <li>To make me hunger more; that I should forge</li>
  <li>Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,</li>
  <li>Destroying them for wealth.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MACDUFF</li>
  <li>This avarice</li>
  <li class="number">Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root</li>
  <li>Than summer-seeming lust, and it hath been</li>
  <li>The sword of our slain kings: yet do not fear;</li>
  <li>Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will.</li>
  <li>Of your mere own: all these are portable,</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MALCOLM</li>
  <li>But I have none: the king-becoming graces,</li>
  <li>As justice, verity, temperance, stableness,</li>
  <li>Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,</li>
  <li>Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,</li>
  <li class="number">I have no relish of them, but abound</li>
  <li>In the division of each several crime,</li>
  <li>Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should</li>
  <li>Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell,</li>
  <li>Uproar the universal peace, confound</li>

  <li class="number">No, not to live. O nation miserable,</li>

  <li>Since that the truest issue of thy throne</li>
  <li>By his own interdiction stands accursed,</li>
  <li class="number">And does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal father</li>
  <li>Was a most sainted king: the queen that bore thee,</li>
  <li>Oftener upon her knees than on her feet,</li>
  <li>Died every day she lived. Fare thee well!</li>
  <li>These evils thou repeat'st upon thyself</li>
  <li class="number">Have banish'd me from Scotland. O my breast,</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MALCOLM</li>
  <li>Macduff, this noble passion,</li>
  <li>Child of integrity, hath from my soul</li>
  <li>Wiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts</li>

  <li>By many of these trains hath sought to win me</li>

  <li>Deal between thee and me! for even now</li>
  <li class="number">I put myself to thy direction, and</li>
  <li>Unspeak mine own detraction, here abjure</li>
  <li>The taints and blames I laid upon myself,</li>
  <li>For strangers to my nature. I am yet</li>
  <li>Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,</li>
  <li class="number">Scarcely have coveted what was mine own,</li>
  <li>At no time broke my faith, would not betray</li>
  <li>The devil to his fellow and delight</li>
  <li>No less in truth than life: my first false speaking</li>
  <li>Was this upon myself: what I am truly,</li>
  <li class="number">Is thine and my poor country's to command:</li>
  <li>Whither indeed, before thy here-approach,</li>
  <li>Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men,</li>
  <li>Already at a point, was setting forth.</li>
  <li>Now we'll together; and the chance of goodness</li>
  <li class="number">Be like our warranted quarrel! Why are you silent?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MACDUFF</li>
  <li>Such welcome and unwelcome things at once</li>

  <li>Ay, sir; there are a crew of wretched souls</li>

  <li>'Tis call'd the evil:</li>

  <li>All swoln and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,</li>
  <li>The mere despair of surgery, he cures,</li>
  <li>Hanging a golden stamp about their necks,</li>
  <li>Put on with holy prayers: and 'tis spoken,</li>
  <li class="number">To the succeeding royalty he leaves</li>
  <li>The healing benediction. With this strange virtue,</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSS</li>
  <li>Alas, poor country!</li>
  <li>Almost afraid to know itself. It cannot</li>

  <li>Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air</li>
  <li>Are made, not mark'd; where violent sorrow seems</li>

  <li>Is there scarce ask'd for who; and good men's lives</li>
  <li class="number">Expire before the flowers in their caps,</li>
  <li>Dying or ere they sicken.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MACDUFF</li>

  <li>But not a niggard of your speech: how goes't?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSS</li>
  <li>When I came hither to transport the tidings,</li>
  <li class="number">Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumour</li>
  <li>Of many worthy fellows that were out;</li>
  <li>Which was to my belief witness'd the rather,</li>
  <li>For that I saw the tyrant's power a-foot:</li>
  <li>Now is the time of help; your eye in Scotland</li>
  <li class="number">Would create soldiers, make our women fight,</li>
  <li>To doff their dire distresses.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MALCOLM</li>
  <li>Be't their comfort</li>
  <li>We are coming thither: gracious England hath</li>
  <li>Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men;</li>
  <li class="number">An older and a better soldier none</li>
  <li>That Christendom gives out.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSS</li>
  <li>Would I could answer</li>
  <li>This comfort with the like! But I have words</li>
  <li>That would be howl'd out in the desert air,</li>
  <li class="number">Where hearing should not latch them.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MACDUFF</li>
  <li>What concern they?</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSS</li>
  <li>No mind that's honest</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MACDUFF</li>
  <li>If it be mine,</li>
  <li>Keep it not from me, quickly let me have it.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSS</li>
  <li>Let not your ears despise my tongue for ever,</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MACDUFF</li>
  <li>Hum! I guess at it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSS</li>
  <li>Your castle is surprised; your wife and babes</li>
  <li>Savagely slaughter'd: to relate the manner,</li>
  <li class="number">Were, on the quarry of these murder'd deer,</li>
  <li>To add the death of you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MALCOLM</li>
  <li>Merciful heaven!</li>
  <li>What, man! ne'er pull your hat upon your brows;</li>
  <li>Give sorrow words: the grief that does not speak</li>
  <li class="number">Whispers the o'er-fraught heart and bids it break.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MACDUFF</li>
  <li>My children too?</li>

  <li class="number">My wife kill'd too?</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSS</li>
  <li>I have said.</li>

  <li class="speaker">MALCOLM</li>
  <li>Be comforted:</li>
  <li>Let's make us medicines of our great revenge,</li>
  <li>To cure this deadly grief.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MACDUFF</li>
  <li class="number">He has no children. All my pretty ones?</li>

  <li>What, all my pretty chickens and their dam</li>
  <li>At one fell swoop?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MALCOLM</li>
  <li>Dispute it like a man.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MACDUFF</li>
  <li class="number">I shall do so;</li>
  <li>But I must also feel it as a man:</li>
  <li>I cannot but remember such things were,</li>
  <li>That were most precious to me. Did heaven look on,</li>
  <li>And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,</li>
  <li class="number">They were all struck for thee! naught that I am,</li>
  <li>Not for their own demerits, but for mine,</li>
  <li>Fell slaughter on their souls. Heaven rest them now!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MALCOLM</li>
  <li>Be this the whetstone of your sword: let grief</li>
  <li>Convert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MACDUFF</li>
  <li class="number">O, I could play the woman with mine eyes</li>
  <li>And braggart with my tongue! But, gentle heavens,</li>
  <li>Cut short all intermission; front to front</li>
  <li>Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself;</li>
  <li>Within my sword's length set him; if he 'scape,</li>
  <li class="number">Heaven forgive him too!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MALCOLM</li>
  <li>This tune goes manly.</li>
  <li>Come, go we to the king; our power is ready;</li>
  <li>Our lack is nothing but our leave; Macbeth</li>
  <li>Is ripe for shaking, and the powers above</li>
  <li class="number">Put on their instruments. Receive what cheer you may:</li>

  <li class="speaker">Doctor</li>
  <li>I have two nights watched with you, but can perceive</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Gentlewoman</li>
  <li class="number">It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus</li>
