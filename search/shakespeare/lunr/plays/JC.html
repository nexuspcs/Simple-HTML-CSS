<h3>SCENE I.  Rome. A street.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter FLAVIUS, MARULLUS, and certain Commoners</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FLAVIUS</li>
  <li>Hence! home, you idle creatures get you home:</li>
  <li>Is this a holiday? what! know you not,</li>
  <li>Being mechanical, you ought not walk</li>
  <li>Upon a labouring day without the sign</li>
  <li class="number">Of your profession? Speak, what trade art thou?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Commoner</li>
  <li>Why, sir, a carpenter.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MARULLUS</li>
  <li>Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?</li>
  <li>What dost thou with thy best apparel on?</li>
  <li>You, sir, what trade are you?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Commoner</li>
  <li class="number">Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am but,</li>
  <li>as you would say, a cobbler.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MARULLUS</li>
  <li>But what trade art thou? answer me directly.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Commoner</li>
  <li>A trade, sir, that, I hope, I may use with a safe</li>
  <li>conscience; which is, indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MARULLUS</li>
  <li class="number">What trade, thou knave? thou naughty knave, what trade?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Commoner</li>
  <li>Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me: yet,</li>
  <li>if you be out, sir, I can mend you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MARULLUS</li>
  <li>What meanest thou by that? mend me, thou saucy fellow!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Commoner</li>
  <li>Why, sir, cobble you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FLAVIUS</li>
  <li class="number">Thou art a cobbler, art thou?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Commoner</li>
  <li>Truly, sir, all that I live by is with the awl: I</li>
  <li>meddle with no tradesman's matters, nor women's</li>
  <li>matters, but with awl. I am, indeed, sir, a surgeon</li>
  <li>to old shoes; when they are in great danger, I</li>
  <li class="number">recover them. As proper men as ever trod upon</li>
  <li>neat's leather have gone upon my handiwork.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FLAVIUS</li>
  <li>But wherefore art not in thy shop today?</li>
  <li>Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Commoner</li>
  <li>Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes, to get myself</li>
  <li class="number">into more work. But, indeed, sir, we make holiday,</li>
  <li>to see Caesar and to rejoice in his triumph.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MARULLUS</li>
  <li>Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?</li>
  <li>What tributaries follow him to Rome,</li>
  <li>To grace in captive bonds his chariot-wheels?</li>
  <li class="number">You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!</li>
  <li>O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,</li>
  <li>Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft</li>
  <li>Have you climb'd up to walls and battlements,</li>
  <li>To towers and windows, yea, to chimney-tops,</li>
  <li class="number">Your infants in your arms, and there have sat</li>
  <li>The livelong day, with patient expectation,</li>
  <li>To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome:</li>
  <li>And when you saw his chariot but appear,</li>
  <li>Have you not made an universal shout,</li>
  <li class="number">That Tiber trembled underneath her banks,</li>
  <li>To hear the replication of your sounds</li>
  <li>Made in her concave shores?</li>
  <li>And do you now put on your best attire?</li>
  <li>And do you now cull out a holiday?</li>
  <li class="number">And do you now strew flowers in his way</li>
  <li>That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood? Be gone!</li>
  <li>Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,</li>
  <li>Pray to the gods to intermit the plague</li>
  <li>That needs must light on this ingratitude.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FLAVIUS</li>
  <li class="number">Go, go, good countrymen, and, for this fault,</li>
  <li>Assemble all the poor men of your sort;</li>
  <li>Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears</li>
  <li>Into the channel, till the lowest stream</li>
  <li>Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Exeunt all the Commoners</li>
  <li class="number">See whether their basest metal be not moved;</li>
  <li>They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.</li>
  <li>Go you down that way towards the Capitol;</li>
  <li>This way will I disrobe the images,</li>
  <li>If you do find them deck'd with ceremonies.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MARULLUS</li>
  <li class="number">May we do so?</li>
  <li>You know it is the feast of Lupercal.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FLAVIUS</li>
  <li>It is no matter; let no images</li>
  <li>Be hung with Caesar's trophies. I'll about,</li>
  <li>And drive away the vulgar from the streets:</li>
  <li class="number">So do you too, where you perceive them thick.</li>
  <li>These growing feathers pluck'd from Caesar's wing</li>
  <li>Will make him fly an ordinary pitch,</li>
  <li>Who else would soar above the view of men</li>
  <li>And keep us all in servile fearfulness.</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Flourish. Enter CAESAR; ANTONY, for the course;
CALPURNIA, PORTIA, DECIUS BRUTUS, CICERO, BRUTUS,
CASSIUS, and CASCA; a great crowd following, among

  <li class="speaker">ANTONY</li>
  <li>Caesar, my lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAESAR</li>
  <li>Forget not, in your speed, Antonius,</li>
  <li>To touch Calpurnia; for our elders say,</li>
  <li class="number">The barren, touched in this holy chase,</li>
  <li>Shake off their sterile curse.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ANTONY</li>
  <li>I shall remember:</li>
  <li>When Caesar says 'do this,' it is perform'd.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAESAR</li>
  <li>Set on; and leave no ceremony out.</li>

  <li class="speaker">CAESAR</li>
  <li>Ha! who calls?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASCA</li>
  <li>Bid every noise be still: peace yet again!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAESAR</li>
  <li>Who is it in the press that calls on me?</li>
  <li>I hear a tongue, shriller than all the music,</li>
  <li class="number">Cry 'Caesar!' Speak; Caesar is turn'd to hear.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Soothsayer</li>
  <li>Beware the ides of March.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAESAR</li>
  <li>What man is that?</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>
  <li>A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAESAR</li>
  <li>Set him before me; let me see his face.</li>

  <li class="number">Fellow, come from the throng; look upon Caesar.</li>

  <li>Beware the ides of March.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAESAR</li>
  <li>He is a dreamer; let us leave him: pass.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Sennet. Exeunt all except BRUTUS and CASSIUS</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASSIUS</li>
  <li>Will you go see the order of the course?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>
  <li class="number">Not I.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASSIUS</li>
  <li>I pray you, do.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>
  <li>I am not gamesome: I do lack some part</li>
  <li>Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.</li>
  <li>Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires;</li>
  <li class="number">I'll leave you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASSIUS</li>
  <li>Brutus, I do observe you now of late:</li>
  <li>I have not from your eyes that gentleness</li>
  <li>And show of love as I was wont to have:</li>
  <li>You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand</li>
  <li class="number">Over your friend that loves you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>
  <li>Cassius,</li>
  <li>Be not deceived: if I have veil'd my look,</li>
  <li>I turn the trouble of my countenance</li>
  <li>Merely upon myself. Vexed I am</li>
  <li class="number">Of late with passions of some difference,</li>
  <li>Conceptions only proper to myself,</li>
  <li>Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;</li>
  <li>But let not therefore my good friends be grieved â€” </li>
  <li>Among which number, Cassius, be you one â€” </li>
  <li class="number">Nor construe any further my neglect,</li>
  <li>Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,</li>
  <li>Forgets the shows of love to other men.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASSIUS</li>
  <li>Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion;</li>
  <li>By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried</li>
  <li class="number">Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.</li>
  <li>Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>
  <li>No, Cassius; for the eye sees not itself,</li>
  <li>But by reflection, by some other things.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASSIUS</li>
  <li>'Tis just:</li>
  <li class="number">And it is very much lamented, Brutus,</li>
  <li>That you have no such mirrors as will turn</li>
  <li>Your hidden worthiness into your eye,</li>
  <li>That you might see your shadow. I have heard,</li>
  <li>Where many of the best respect in Rome,</li>
  <li class="number">Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus</li>
  <li>And groaning underneath this age's yoke,</li>
  <li>Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>
  <li>Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,</li>
  <li>That you would have me seek into myself</li>
  <li class="number">For that which is not in me?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASSIUS</li>
  <li>Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear:</li>
  <li>And since you know you cannot see yourself</li>
  <li>So well as by reflection, I, your glass,</li>
  <li>Will modestly discover to yourself</li>
  <li class="number">That of yourself which you yet know not of.</li>
  <li>And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus:</li>
  <li>Were I a common laugher, or did use</li>
  <li>To stale with ordinary oaths my love</li>
  <li>To every new protester; if you know</li>
  <li class="number">That I do fawn on men and hug them hard</li>
  <li>And after scandal them, or if you know</li>
  <li>That I profess myself in banqueting</li>
  <li>To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Flourish, and shout</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>
  <li>What means this shouting? I do fear, the people</li>
  <li class="number">Choose Caesar for their king.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASSIUS</li>
  <li>Ay, do you fear it?</li>
  <li>Then must I think you would not have it so.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>
  <li>I would not, Cassius; yet I love him well.</li>
  <li>But wherefore do you hold me here so long?</li>
  <li class="number">What is it that you would impart to me?</li>
  <li>If it be aught toward the general good,</li>
  <li>Set honour in one eye and death i' the other,</li>
  <li>And I will look on both indifferently,</li>
  <li>For let the gods so speed me as I love</li>
  <li class="number">The name of honour more than I fear death.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASSIUS</li>
  <li>I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,</li>
  <li>As well as I do know your outward favour.</li>
  <li>Well, honour is the subject of my story.</li>
  <li>I cannot tell what you and other men</li>
  <li class="number">Think of this life; but, for my single self,</li>
  <li>I had as lief not be as live to be</li>
  <li>In awe of such a thing as I myself.</li>
  <li>I was born free as Caesar; so were you:</li>
  <li>We both have fed as well, and we can both</li>
  <li class="number">Endure the winter's cold as well as he:</li>
  <li>For once, upon a raw and gusty day,</li>
  <li>The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,</li>
  <li>Caesar said to me 'Darest thou, Cassius, now</li>
  <li>Leap in with me into this angry flood,</li>
  <li class="number">And swim to yonder point?' Upon the word,</li>
  <li>Accoutred as I was, I plunged in</li>
  <li>And bade him follow; so indeed he did.</li>
  <li>The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it</li>
  <li>With lusty sinews, throwing it aside</li>
  <li class="number">And stemming it with hearts of controversy;</li>
  <li>But ere we could arrive the point proposed,</li>
  <li>Caesar cried 'Help me, Cassius, or I sink!'</li>
  <li>I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,</li>
  <li>Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder</li>
  <li class="number">The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber</li>
  <li>Did I the tired Caesar. And this man</li>
  <li>Is now become a god, and Cassius is</li>
  <li>A wretched creature and must bend his body,</li>
  <li>If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.</li>
  <li class="number">He had a fever when he was in Spain,</li>
  <li>And when the fit was on him, I did mark</li>
  <li>How he did shake: 'tis true, this god did shake;</li>
  <li>His coward lips did from their colour fly,</li>
  <li>And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world</li>
  <li class="number">Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan:</li>
  <li>Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans</li>
  <li>Mark him and write his speeches in their books,</li>
  <li>Alas, it cried 'Give me some drink, Titinius,'</li>
  <li>As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me</li>
  <li class="number">A man of such a feeble temper should</li>
  <li>So get the start of the majestic world</li>
  <li>And bear the palm alone.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Shout. Flourish</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>
  <li>Another general shout!</li>
  <li>I do believe that these applauses are</li>
  <li class="number">For some new honours that are heap'd on Caesar.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASSIUS</li>
  <li>Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world</li>
  <li>Like a Colossus, and we petty men</li>
  <li>Walk under his huge legs and peep about</li>
  <li>To find ourselves dishonourable graves.</li>
  <li class="number">Men at some time are masters of their fates:</li>
  <li>The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,</li>
  <li>But in ourselves, that we are underlings.</li>
  <li>Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that 'Caesar'?</li>
  <li>Why should that name be sounded more than yours?</li>
  <li class="number">Write them together, yours is as fair a name;</li>
  <li>Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;</li>
  <li>Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with 'em,</li>
  <li>Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar.</li>
  <li>Now, in the names of all the gods at once,</li>
  <li class="number">Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed,</li>
  <li>That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!</li>
  <li>Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!</li>
  <li>When went there by an age, since the great flood,</li>
  <li>But it was famed with more than with one man?</li>
  <li class="number">When could they say till now, that talk'd of Rome,</li>
  <li>That her wide walls encompass'd but one man?</li>
  <li>Now is it Rome indeed and room enough,</li>
  <li>When there is in it but one only man.</li>
  <li>O, you and I have heard our fathers say,</li>
  <li class="number">There was a Brutus once that would have brook'd</li>
  <li>The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome</li>
  <li>As easily as a king.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>
  <li>That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;</li>
  <li>What you would work me to, I have some aim:</li>
  <li class="number">How I have thought of this and of these times,</li>
  <li>I shall recount hereafter; for this present,</li>
  <li>I would not, so with love I might entreat you,</li>
  <li>Be any further moved. What you have said</li>
  <li>I will consider; what you have to say</li>
  <li class="number">I will with patience hear, and find a time</li>
  <li>Both meet to hear and answer such high things.</li>
  <li>Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:</li>
  <li>Brutus had rather be a villager</li>
  <li>Than to repute himself a son of Rome</li>
  <li class="number">Under these hard conditions as this time</li>
  <li>Is like to lay upon us.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASSIUS</li>
  <li>I am glad that my weak words</li>
  <li>Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>
  <li>The games are done and Caesar is returning.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASSIUS</li>
  <li class="number">As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve;</li>
  <li>And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you</li>
  <li>What hath proceeded worthy note to-day.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Re-enter CAESAR and his Train</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>
  <li>I will do so. But, look you, Cassius,</li>
  <li>The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow,</li>
  <li class="number">And all the rest look like a chidden train:</li>
  <li>Calpurnia's cheek is pale; and Cicero</li>
  <li>Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes</li>
  <li>As we have seen him in the Capitol,</li>
  <li>Being cross'd in conference by some senators.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASSIUS</li>
  <li class="number">Casca will tell us what the matter is.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAESAR</li>
  <li>Let me have men about me that are fat;</li>
  <li>Sleek-headed men and such as sleep o' nights:</li>
  <li class="number">Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;</li>
  <li>He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.</li>

  <li>So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much;</li>
  <li>He is a great observer and he looks</li>

  <li>Ay, Casca; tell us what hath chanced to-day,</li>
  <li>That Caesar looks so sad.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASCA</li>
  <li>Why, you were with him, were you not?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>
  <li class="number">I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASCA</li>
  <li>Why, there was a crown offered him: and being</li>
  <li>offered him, he put it by with the back of his hand,</li>
  <li>thus; and then the people fell a-shouting.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>
  <li>What was the second noise for?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASCA</li>
  <li class="number">Why, for that too.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASSIUS</li>
  <li>They shouted thrice: what was the last cry for?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASCA</li>
  <li>Why, for that too.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>
  <li>Was the crown offered him thrice?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASCA</li>
  <li>Ay, marry, was't, and he put it by thrice, every</li>
  <li class="number">time gentler than other, and at every putting-by</li>
  <li>mine honest neighbours shouted.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASSIUS</li>
  <li>Who offered him the crown?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASCA</li>
  <li>Why, Antony.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>
  <li>Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASCA</li>
  <li class="number">I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it:</li>
  <li>it was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark</li>
  <li>Antony offer him a crown; â€” yet 'twas not a crown</li>
  <li>neither, 'twas one of these coronets; â€” and, as I told</li>
  <li>you, he put it by once: but, for all that, to my</li>
  <li class="number">thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he</li>
  <li>offered it to him again; then he put it by again:</li>
  <li>but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his</li>
  <li>fingers off it. And then he offered it the third</li>
  <li>time; he put it the third time by: and still as he</li>
  <li class="number">refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their</li>
  <li>chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps</li>
  <li>and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because</li>
  <li>Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked</li>
  <li>Caesar; for he swounded and fell down at it: and</li>
  <li class="number">for mine own part, I durst not laugh, for fear of</li>
  <li>opening my lips and receiving the bad air.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASSIUS</li>
  <li>But, soft, I pray you: what, did Caesar swound?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASCA</li>
  <li>He fell down in the market-place, and foamed at</li>
  <li>mouth, and was speechless.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>
  <li class="number">'Tis very like: he hath the failing sickness.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASSIUS</li>
  <li>No, Caesar hath it not; but you and I,</li>
  <li>And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASCA</li>
  <li>I know not what you mean by that; but, I am sure,</li>
  <li>Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not</li>
  <li class="number">clap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and</li>
  <li>displeased them, as they use to do the players in</li>
  <li>the theatre, I am no true man.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>
  <li>What said he when he came unto himself?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASCA</li>
  <li>Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the</li>
  <li class="number">common herd was glad he refused the crown, he</li>
  <li>plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his</li>
  <li>throat to cut. An I had been a man of any</li>
  <li>occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word,</li>
  <li>I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so</li>
  <li class="number">he fell. When he came to himself again, he said,</li>
  <li>If he had done or said any thing amiss, he desired</li>
  <li>their worships to think it was his infirmity. Three</li>
  <li>or four wenches, where I stood, cried 'Alas, good</li>
  <li>soul!' and forgave him with all their hearts: but</li>
  <li class="number">there's no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had</li>
  <li>stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>
  <li>And after that, he came, thus sad, away?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASCA</li>
  <li>Ay.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASSIUS</li>
  <li>Did Cicero say any thing?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASCA</li>
  <li class="number">Ay, he spoke Greek.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASSIUS</li>
  <li>To what effect?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASCA</li>
  <li>Nay, an I tell you that, Ill ne'er look you i' the</li>
  <li>face again: but those that understood him smiled at</li>
  <li>one another and shook their heads; but, for mine own</li>
  <li class="number">part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more</li>
  <li>news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs</li>
  <li>off Caesar's images, are put to silence. Fare you</li>
  <li>well. There was more foolery yet, if I could</li>
  <li>remember it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASSIUS</li>
  <li class="number">Will you sup with me to-night, Casca?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASCA</li>
  <li>No, I am promised forth.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASSIUS</li>
  <li>Will you dine with me to-morrow?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASCA</li>
  <li>Ay, if I be alive and your mind hold and your dinner</li>
  <li>worth the eating.</li>

  <li class="number">Good: I will expect you.</li>

<h3>SCENE III.  The same. A street.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Thunder and lightning. Enter from opposite sides,
CASCA, with his sword drawn, and CICERO</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CICERO</li>
  <li>Good even, Casca: brought you Caesar home?</li>
  <li>Why are you breathless? and why stare you so?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASCA</li>
  <li>Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth</li>
  <li>Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero,</li>
  <li class="number">I have seen tempests, when the scolding winds</li>
  <li>Have rived the knotty oaks, and I have seen</li>
  <li>The ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam,</li>
  <li>To be exalted with the threatening clouds:</li>
  <li>But never till to-night, never till now,</li>
  <li class="number">Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.</li>
  <li>Either there is a civil strife in heaven,</li>
  <li>Or else the world, too saucy with the gods,</li>
  <li>Incenses them to send destruction.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CICERO</li>
  <li>Why, saw you any thing more wonderful?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASCA</li>
  <li class="number">A common slave â€” you know him well by sight â€” </li>
  <li>Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn</li>
  <li>Like twenty torches join'd, and yet his hand,</li>
  <li>Not sensible of fire, remain'd unscorch'd.</li>
  <li>Besides â€” I ha' not since put up my sword â€” </li>
  <li class="number">Against the Capitol I met a lion,</li>
  <li>Who glared upon me, and went surly by,</li>
  <li>Without annoying me: and there were drawn</li>
  <li>Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women,</li>
  <li>Transformed with their fear; who swore they saw</li>
  <li class="number">Men all in fire walk up and down the streets.</li>
  <li>And yesterday the bird of night did sit</li>
  <li>Even at noon-day upon the market-place,</li>
  <li>Hooting and shrieking. When these prodigies</li>
  <li>Do so conjointly meet, let not men say</li>
  <li class="number">'These are their reasons; they are natural;'</li>
  <li>For, I believe, they are portentous things</li>
  <li>Unto the climate that they point upon.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">

  <li>Come Caesar to the Capitol to-morrow?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">

<div class="stage-direction">Exit CICERO</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASSIUS</li>
  <li>Who's there?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASCA</li>
  <li>A Roman.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASSIUS</li>
  <li>Casca, by your voice.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASCA</li>
  <li class="number">Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASSIUS</li>
  <li>A very pleasing night to honest men.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASCA</li>
  <li>Who ever knew the heavens menace so?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASSIUS</li>
  <li>Those that have known the earth so full of faults.</li>
  <li>For my part, I have walk'd about the streets,</li>
  <li class="number">Submitting me unto the perilous night,</li>
  <li>And, thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,</li>
  <li>Have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone;</li>
  <li>And when the cross blue lightning seem'd to open</li>
  <li>The breast of heaven, I did present myself</li>
  <li class="number">Even in the aim and very flash of it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASCA</li>
  <li>But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?</li>
  <li>It is the part of men to fear and tremble,</li>
  <li>When the most mighty gods by tokens send</li>
  <li>Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASSIUS</li>
  <li class="number">You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life</li>
  <li>That should be in a Roman you do want,</li>
  <li>Or else you use not. You look pale and gaze</li>
  <li>And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder,</li>
  <li>To see the strange impatience of the heavens:</li>
  <li class="number">But if you would consider the true cause</li>
  <li>Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,</li>
  <li>Why birds and beasts from quality and kind,</li>
  <li>Why old men fool and children calculate,</li>
  <li>Why all these things change from their ordinance</li>
  <li class="number">Their natures and preformed faculties</li>
  <li>To monstrous quality â€”  why, you shall find</li>
  <li>That heaven hath infused them with these spirits,</li>
  <li>To make them instruments of fear and warning</li>
  <li>Unto some monstrous state.</li>
  <li class="number">Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man</li>
  <li>Most like this dreadful night,</li>
  <li>That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars</li>
  <li>As doth the lion in the Capitol,</li>
  <li>A man no mightier than thyself or me</li>
  <li class="number">In personal action, yet prodigious grown</li>
  <li>And fearful, as these strange eruptions are.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASCA</li>
  <li>'Tis Caesar that you mean; is it not, Cassius?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASSIUS</li>
  <li>Let it be who it is: for Romans now</li>
  <li>Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors;</li>
  <li class="number">But, woe the while! our fathers' minds are dead,</li>
  <li>And we are govern'd with our mothers' spirits;</li>
  <li>Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASCA</li>
  <li>Indeed, they say the senators tomorrow</li>
  <li>Mean to establish Caesar as a king;</li>
  <li class="number">And he shall wear his crown by sea and land,</li>
  <li>In every place, save here in Italy.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASSIUS</li>
  <li>I know where I will wear this dagger then;</li>
  <li>Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius:</li>
  <li>Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong;</li>
  <li class="number">Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat:</li>
  <li>Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,</li>
  <li>Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron,</li>
  <li>Can be retentive to the strength of spirit;</li>
  <li>But life, being weary of these worldly bars,</li>
  <li class="number">Never lacks power to dismiss itself.</li>
  <li>If I know this, know all the world besides,</li>
  <li>That part of tyranny that I do bear</li>
  <li>I can shake off at pleasure.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Thunder still</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASCA</li>
  <li>So can I:</li>
  <li class="number">So every bondman in his own hand bears</li>
  <li>The power to cancel his captivity.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASSIUS</li>
  <li>And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?</li>
  <li>Poor man! I know he would not be a wolf,</li>
  <li>But that he sees the Romans are but sheep:</li>
  <li class="number">He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.</li>
  <li>Those that with haste will make a mighty fire</li>
  <li>Begin it with weak straws: what trash is Rome,</li>
  <li>What rubbish and what offal, when it serves</li>
  <li>For the base matter to illuminate</li>
  <li class="number">So vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief,</li>
  <li>Where hast thou led me? I perhaps speak this</li>
  <li>Before a willing bondman; then I know</li>
  <li>My answer must be made. But I am arm'd,</li>
  <li>And dangers are to me indifferent.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASCA</li>
  <li class="number">You speak to Casca, and to such a man</li>
  <li>That is no fleering tell-tale. Hold, my hand:</li>
  <li>Be factious for redress of all these griefs,</li>
  <li>And I will set this foot of mine as far</li>
  <li>As who goes farthest.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASSIUS</li>
  <li class="number">There's a bargain made.</li>
  <li>Now know you, Casca, I have moved already</li>
  <li>Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans</li>
  <li>To undergo with me an enterprise</li>
  <li>Of honourable-dangerous consequence;</li>
  <li class="number">And I do know, by this, they stay for me</li>
  <li>In Pompey's porch: for now, this fearful night,</li>
  <li>There is no stir or walking in the streets;</li>
  <li>And the complexion of the element</li>
  <li>In favour's like the work we have in hand,</li>
  <li class="number">Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASCA</li>
  <li>Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASSIUS</li>
  <li>'Tis Cinna; I do know him by his gait;</li>
  <li>He is a friend.</li>

  <li>Cinna, where haste you so?</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CINNA</li>
  <li>I am glad on 't. What a fearful night is this!</li>

  <li>Yes, you are.</li>
  <li>O Cassius, if you could</li>
  <li>But win the noble Brutus to our party â€” </li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASSIUS</li>
  <li>Be you content: good Cinna, take this paper,</li>
  <li class="number">And look you lay it in the praetor's chair,</li>
  <li>Where Brutus may but find it; and throw this</li>
  <li>In at his window; set this up with wax</li>
  <li>Upon old Brutus' statue: all this done,</li>
  <li>Repair to Pompey's porch, where you shall find us.</li>
  <li class="number">Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?</li>
</ol>

  <li>It is the bright day that brings forth the adder;</li>

  <li>Caesar must bleed for it! And, gentle friends,</li>
  <li>Let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;</li>
  <li class="number">Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,</li>
  <li>Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds:</li>

  <li class="number">Our purpose necessary and not envious:</li>
  <li>Which so appearing to the common eyes,</li>

  <li>Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck</li>
  <li>Reviving blood, and that great men shall press</li>

  <li>To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.</li>
  <li>If you shall send them word you will not come,</li>

  <li class="number">Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,</li>

  <li>Romans, countrymen, and lovers! hear me for my</li>

  <li>was no less than his. If then that friend demand</li>
  <li>why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer:</li>
  <li> â€” Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved</li>
  <li>Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living and</li>
  <li class="number">die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live</li>
  <li>all free men? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him;</li>
  <li>as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was</li>
  <li>valiant, I honour him: but, as he was ambitious, I</li>
  <li>slew him. There is tears for his love; joy for his</li>
  <li class="number">fortune; honour for his valour; and death for his</li>
  <li>ambition. Who is here so base that would be a</li>
  <li>bondman? If any, speak; for him have I offended.</li>
  <li>Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If</li>
  <li>any, speak; for him have I offended. Who is here so</li>

  <li class="speaker">ANTONY</li>
  <li>Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;</li>
  <li>I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.</li>
  <li>The evil that men do lives after them;</li>
  <li class="number">The good is oft interred with their bones;</li>
  <li>So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus</li>
  <li>Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:</li>
  <li>If it were so, it was a grievous fault,</li>
  <li>And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.</li>
  <li class="number">Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest â€” </li>
  <li>For Brutus is an honourable man;</li>
  <li>So are they all, all honourable men â€” </li>
  <li>Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.</li>
  <li>He was my friend, faithful and just to me:</li>
  <li class="number">But Brutus says he was ambitious;</li>
  <li>And Brutus is an honourable man.</li>
  <li>He hath brought many captives home to Rome</li>
  <li>Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:</li>
  <li>Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?</li>
  <li class="number">When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:</li>
  <li>Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:</li>
  <li>Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;</li>
  <li>And Brutus is an honourable man.</li>
  <li>You all did see that on the Lupercal</li>
  <li class="number">I thrice presented him a kingly crown,</li>
  <li>Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?</li>
  <li>Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;</li>
  <li>And, sure, he is an honourable man.</li>
  <li>I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,</li>
  <li class="number">But here I am to speak what I do know.</li>
  <li>You all did love him once, not without cause:</li>
  <li>What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?</li>
  <li>O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,</li>
  <li>And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;</li>
  <li class="number">My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,</li>
  <li>And I must pause till it come back to me.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Citizen</li>
  <li>Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Citizen</li>
  <li>If thou consider rightly of the matter,</li>
  <li>Caesar has had great wrong.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Third Citizen</li>
  <li class="number">Has he, masters?</li>
  <li>I fear there will a worse come in his place.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Fourth Citizen</li>
  <li>Mark'd ye his words? He would not take the crown;</li>
  <li>Therefore 'tis certain he was not ambitious.</li>

  <li>There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.</li>

  <li>But yesterday the word of Caesar might</li>
  <li>Have stood against the world; now lies he there.</li>

  <li>O masters, if I were disposed to stir</li>
  <li>Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,</li>
  <li>I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong,</li>
  <li>Who, you all know, are honourable men:</li>
  <li class="number">I will not do them wrong; I rather choose</li>
  <li>To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,</li>
  <li>Than I will wrong such honourable men.</li>
  <li>But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar;</li>
  <li>I found it in his closet, 'tis his will:</li>
  <li class="number">Let but the commons hear this testament â€” </li>
  <li>Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read â€” </li>
  <li>And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds</li>
  <li>And dip their napkins in his sacred blood,</li>
  <li>Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,</li>
  <li class="number">And, dying, mention it within their wills,</li>
  <li>Bequeathing it as a rich legacy</li>
  <li>Unto their issue.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">

  <li>It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.</li>
  <li>You are not wood, you are not stones, but men;</li>

  <li>It will inflame you, it will make you mad:</li>

  <li>If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.</li>
  <li>You all do know this mantle: I remember</li>
  <li class="number">The first time ever Caesar put it on;</li>
  <li>'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,</li>
  <li>That day he overcame the Nervii:</li>
  <li>Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through:</li>
  <li>See what a rent the envious Casca made:</li>
  <li class="number">Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd;</li>
  <li>And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,</li>
  <li>Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it,</li>
  <li>As rushing out of doors, to be resolved</li>
  <li>If Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no;</li>
  <li class="number">For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar's angel:</li>
  <li>Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!</li>
  <li>This was the most unkindest cut of all;</li>
  <li>For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,</li>
  <li>Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,</li>
  <li class="number">Quite vanquish'd him: then burst his mighty heart;</li>
  <li>And, in his mantle muffling up his face,</li>
  <li>Even at the base of Pompey's statua,</li>
  <li>Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.</li>
  <li>O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!</li>
  <li class="number">Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,</li>
  <li>Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.</li>
  <li>O, now you weep; and, I perceive, you feel</li>
  <li>The dint of pity: these are gracious drops.</li>
  <li>Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold</li>
  <li class="number">Our Caesar's vesture wounded? Look you here,</li>
  <li>Here is himself, marr'd, as you see, with traitors.</li>

  <li class="speaker">ANTONY</li>
  <li>These many, then, shall die; their names are prick'd.</li>

  <li>Your brother too must die; consent you, Lepidus?</li>

  <li>I do consent â€” </li>

  <li>Who is your sister's son, Mark Antony.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ANTONY</li>
  <li>He shall not live; look, with a spot I damn him.</li>
  <li>But, Lepidus, go you to Caesar's house;</li>
  <li>Fetch the will hither, and we shall determine</li>
  <li class="number">How to cut off some charge in legacies.</li>

<ol class="speech">

  <li class="speaker">ANTONY</li>
  <li>This is a slight unmeritable man,</li>

  <li class="number">The three-fold world divided, he should stand</li>
  <li>One of the three to share it?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OCTAVIUS</li>
  <li>So you thought him;</li>
  <li>And took his voice who should be prick'd to die,</li>
  <li>In our black sentence and proscription.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ANTONY</li>
  <li class="number">Octavius, I have seen more days than you:</li>
  <li>And though we lay these honours on this man,</li>
  <li>To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads,</li>
  <li>He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,</li>
  <li>To groan and sweat under the business,</li>
  <li class="number">Either led or driven, as we point the way;</li>
  <li>And having brought our treasure where we will,</li>
  <li>Then take we down his load, and turn him off,</li>
  <li>Like to the empty ass, to shake his ears,</li>
  <li>And graze in commons.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OCTAVIUS</li>
  <li class="number">You may do your will;</li>
  <li>But he's a tried and valiant soldier.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ANTONY</li>
  <li>So is my horse, Octavius; and for that</li>
  <li>I do appoint him store of provender:</li>
  <li>It is a creature that I teach to fight,</li>
  <li class="number">To wind, to stop, to run directly on,</li>
  <li>His corporal motion govern'd by my spirit.</li>
  <li>And, in some taste, is Lepidus but so;</li>
  <li>He must be taught and train'd and bid go forth;</li>
  <li>A barren-spirited fellow; one that feeds</li>
  <li class="number">On abjects, orts and imitations,</li>
  <li>Which, out of use and staled by other men,</li>
  <li>Begin his fashion: do not talk of him,</li>
  <li>But as a property. And now, Octavius,</li>
  <li>Listen great things: â€” Brutus and Cassius</li>
  <li class="number">Are levying powers: we must straight make head:</li>
  <li>Therefore let our alliance be combined,</li>
  <li>Our best friends made, our means stretch'd</li>
  <li>And let us presently go sit in council,</li>
  <li>How covert matters may be best disclosed,</li>
  <li class="number">And open perils surest answered.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OCTAVIUS</li>
  <li>Let us do so: for we are at the stake,</li>

  <li>Millions of mischiefs.</li>

  <li>By heaven, I had rather coin my heart,</li>
  <li class="number">And drop my blood for drachmas, than to wring</li>
  <li>From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash</li>
  <li>By any indirection: I did send</li>
  <li>To you for gold to pay my legions,</li>
  <li>Which you denied me: was that done like Cassius?</li>
  <li class="number">Should I have answer'd Caius Cassius so?</li>

  <li>Cheque'd like a bondman; all his faults observed,</li>
  <li>Set in a note-book, learn'd, and conn'd by rote,</li>
  <li>To cast into my teeth. O, I could weep</li>
  <li>My spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger,</li>
  <li class="number">And here my naked breast; within, a heart</li>
  <li>Dearer than Plutus' mine, richer than gold:</li>
  <li>If that thou be'st a Roman, take it forth;</li>
  <li>I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart:</li>
  <li>Strike, as thou didst at Caesar; for, I know,</li>

  <li>Than ever thou lovedst Cassius.</li>

  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>

  <li>Bending their expedition toward Philippi.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MESSALA</li>
  <li>Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>
  <li>With what addition?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MESSALA</li>
  <li>That by proscription and bills of outlawry,</li>
  <li class="number">Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus,</li>
  <li>Have put to death an hundred senators.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>
  <li>Therein our letters do not well agree;</li>
  <li>Mine speak of seventy senators that died</li>
  <li>By their proscriptions, Cicero being one.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASSIUS</li>
  <li class="number">Cicero one!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MESSALA</li>
  <li>Cicero is dead,</li>

  <li>Had you your letters from your wife, my lord?</li>

  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>
  <li>No, Messala.</li>

  <li class="speaker">MESSALA</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>
  <li>Nothing, Messala.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MESSALA</li>
  <li>That, methinks, is strange.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>
  <li>Why ask you? hear you aught of her in yours?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MESSALA</li>
  <li>No, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>
  <li class="number">Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MESSALA</li>
  <li>Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell:</li>
  <li>For certain she is dead, and by strange manner.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>
  <li>Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala:</li>
  <li>With meditating that she must die once,</li>
  <li class="number">I have the patience to endure it now.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MESSALA</li>
  <li>Even so great men great losses should endure.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASSIUS</li>
  <li>I have as much of this in art as you,</li>

  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>
  <li>Well, to our work alive. What do you think</li>
  <li class="number">Of marching to Philippi presently?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASSIUS</li>
  <li>I do not think it good.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>
  <li>Your reason?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASSIUS</li>
  <li>This it is:</li>
  <li>'Tis better that the enemy seek us:</li>
  <li class="number">So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,</li>
  <li>Doing himself offence; whilst we, lying still,</li>
  <li>Are full of rest, defense, and nimbleness.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>
  <li>Good reasons must, of force, give place to better.</li>
  <li>The people 'twixt Philippi and this ground</li>
  <li class="number">Do stand but in a forced affection;</li>
  <li>For they have grudged us contribution:</li>
  <li>The enemy, marching along by them,</li>
  <li>By them shall make a fuller number up,</li>
  <li>Come on refresh'd, new-added, and encouraged;</li>
  <li class="number">From which advantage shall we cut him off,</li>
  <li>If at Philippi we do face him there,</li>
  <li>These people at our back.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASSIUS</li>
  <li>Hear me, good brother.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>
  <li>Under your pardon. You must note beside,</li>
  <li class="number">That we have tried the utmost of our friends,</li>
  <li>Our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe:</li>
  <li>The enemy increaseth every day;</li>
  <li>We, at the height, are ready to decline.</li>
  <li>There is a tide in the affairs of men,</li>
  <li class="number">Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;</li>
  <li>Omitted, all the voyage of their life</li>
  <li>Is bound in shallows and in miseries.</li>
  <li>On such a full sea are we now afloat;</li>
  <li>And we must take the current when it serves,</li>
  <li class="number">Or lose our ventures.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASSIUS</li>
  <li>Then, with your will, go on;</li>
  <li>We'll along ourselves, and meet them at Philippi.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>
  <li>The deep of night is crept upon our talk,</li>

  <li>There is no more to say?</li>

  <li class="speaker">ANTONY</li>
  <li>Villains, you did not so, when your vile daggers</li>

  <li class="speaker">MESSALA</li>
  <li>Standing forth  What says my general?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASSIUS</li>
  <li>Messala,</li>
  <li>This is my birth-day; as this very day</li>
  <li>Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala:</li>
  <li class="number">Be thou my witness that against my will,</li>
  <li>As Pompey was, am I compell'd to set</li>
  <li>Upon one battle all our liberties.</li>
  <li>You know that I held Epicurus strong</li>
  <li>And his opinion: now I change my mind,</li>
  <li class="number">And partly credit things that do presage.</li>
  <li>Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign</li>
  <li>Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perch'd,</li>
  <li>Gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands;</li>
  <li>Who to Philippi here consorted us:</li>
  <li class="number">This morning are they fled away and gone;</li>
  <li>And in their steads do ravens, crows and kites,</li>
  <li>Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us,</li>
  <li>As we were sickly prey: their shadows seem</li>
  <li>A canopy most fatal, under which</li>
  <li class="number">Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MESSALA</li>
  <li>Believe not so.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASSIUS</li>
  <li>I but believe it partly;</li>
  <li>For I am fresh of spirit and resolved</li>
  <li>To meet all perils very constantly.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>
  <li class="number">Even so, Lucilius.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASSIUS</li>
  <li>Now, most noble Brutus,</li>
  <li>The gods to-day stand friendly, that we may,</li>
  <li>Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age!</li>
  <li>But since the affairs of men rest still incertain,</li>
  <li class="number">Let's reason with the worst that may befall.</li>
  <li>If we do lose this battle, then is this</li>
  <li>The very last time we shall speak together:</li>
  <li>What are you then determined to do?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>
  <li>Even by the rule of that philosophy</li>
  <li class="number">By which I did blame Cato for the death</li>
  <li>Which he did give himself, I know not how,</li>
  <li>But I do find it cowardly and vile,</li>
  <li>For fear of what might fall, so to prevent</li>
  <li>The time of life: arming myself with patience</li>
  <li class="number">To stay the providence of some high powers</li>
  <li>That govern us below.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASSIUS</li>
  <li>Then, if we lose this battle,</li>
  <li>You are contented to be led in triumph</li>
  <li>Thorough the streets of Rome?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>
  <li class="number">No, Cassius, no: think not, thou noble Roman,</li>
  <li>That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome;</li>
  <li>He bears too great a mind. But this same day</li>
  <li>Must end that work the ides of March begun;</li>
  <li>And whether we shall meet again I know not.</li>
  <li class="number">Therefore our everlasting farewell take:</li>
  <li>For ever, and for ever, farewell, Cassius!</li>
  <li>If we do meet again, why, we shall smile;</li>
  <li>If not, why then, this parting was well made.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CASSIUS</li>
  <li>For ever, and for ever, farewell, Brutus!</li>
  <li class="number">If we do meet again, we'll smile indeed;</li>
  <li>If not, 'tis true this parting was well made.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>
  <li>Why, then, lead on. O, that a man might know</li>
  <li>The end of this day's business ere it come!</li>
  <li>But it sufficeth that the day will end,</li>
  <li class="number">And then the end is known. Come, ho! away!</li>

  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>
  <li class="number">Farewell, good Strato.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Runs on his sword</li>
  <li>Caesar, now be still:</li>
  <li>I kill'd not thee with half so good a will.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Dies</div>

<div class="stage-direction">Alarum. Retreat. Enter OCTAVIUS, ANTONY, MESSALA,
LUCILIUS, and the army</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OCTAVIUS</li>
  <li>What man is that?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MESSALA</li>
  <li>My master's man. Strato, where is thy master?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">STRATO</li>
  <li class="number">Free from the bondage you are in, Messala:</li>
  <li>The conquerors can but make a fire of him;</li>
  <li>For Brutus only overcame himself,</li>
  <li>And no man else hath honour by his death.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LUCILIUS</li>
  <li>So Brutus should be found. I thank thee, Brutus,</li>
  <li class="number">That thou hast proved Lucilius' saying true.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OCTAVIUS</li>
  <li>All that served Brutus, I will entertain them.</li>
  <li>Fellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">STRATO</li>
  <li>Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OCTAVIUS</li>
  <li>Do so, good Messala.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MESSALA</li>
  <li class="number">How died my master, Strato?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">STRATO</li>
  <li>I held the sword, and he did run on it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MESSALA</li>
  <li>Octavius, then take him to follow thee,</li>
  <li>That did the latest service to my master.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ANTONY</li>
  <li>This was the noblest Roman of them all:</li>
  <li class="number">All the conspirators save only he</li>
  <li>Did that they did in envy of great Caesar;</li>
  <li>He only, in a general honest thought</li>
  <li>And common good to all, made one of them.</li>
  <li>His life was gentle, and the elements</li>
  <li class="number">So mix'd in him that Nature might stand up</li>
  <li>And say to all the world 'This was a man!'</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OCTAVIUS</li>
  <li>According to his virtue let us use him,</li>
  <li>With all respect and rites of burial.</li>
  <li>Within my tent his bones to-night shall lie,</li>
  <li class="number">Most like a soldier, order'd honourably.</li>
  <li>So call the field to rest; and let's away,</li>
  <li>To part the glories of this happy day.</li>
</ol>
