<h3>SCENE I.  Orchard of Oliver's house.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter ORLANDO and ADAM</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li>As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion</li>
  <li>bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,</li>
  <li>and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his</li>
  <li>blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my</li>
  <li class="number">sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and</li>
  <li>report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,</li>
  <li>he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more</li>
  <li>properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you</li>
  <li>that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that</li>
  <li class="number">differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses</li>
  <li>are bred better; for, besides that they are fair</li>
  <li>with their feeding, they are taught their manage,</li>
  <li>and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his</li>
  <li>brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the</li>
  <li class="number">which his animals on his dunghills are as much</li>
  <li>bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so</li>
  <li>plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave</li>
  <li>me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets</li>
  <li>me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a</li>
  <li class="number">brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my</li>
  <li>gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that</li>
  <li>grieves me; and the spirit of my father, which I</li>
  <li>think is within me, begins to mutiny against this</li>
  <li>servitude: I will no longer endure it, though yet I</li>
  <li class="number">know no wise remedy how to avoid it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ADAM</li>
  <li>Yonder comes my master, your brother.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li>Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will</li>
  <li>shake me up.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter OLIVER</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OLIVER</li>
  <li>Now, sir! what make you here?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li class="number">Nothing: I am not taught to make any thing.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OLIVER</li>
  <li>What mar you then, sir?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li>Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God</li>
  <li>made, a poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OLIVER</li>
  <li>Marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li class="number">Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them?</li>
  <li>What prodigal portion have I spent, that I should</li>
  <li>come to such penury?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OLIVER</li>
  <li>Know you where your are, sir?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li>O, sir, very well; here in your orchard.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OLIVER</li>
  <li class="number">Know you before whom, sir?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li>Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I know</li>
  <li>you are my eldest brother; and, in the gentle</li>
  <li>condition of blood, you should so know me. The</li>
  <li>courtesy of nations allows you my better, in that</li>
  <li class="number">you are the first-born; but the same tradition</li>
  <li>takes not away my blood, were there twenty brothers</li>
  <li>betwixt us: I have as much of my father in me as</li>
  <li>you; albeit, I confess, your coming before me is</li>
  <li>nearer to his reverence.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OLIVER</li>
  <li class="number">What, boy!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li>Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OLIVER</li>
  <li>Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li>I am no villain; I am the youngest son of Sir</li>
  <li>Rowland de Boys; he was my father, and he is thrice</li>
  <li class="number">a villain that says such a father begot villains.</li>
  <li>Wert thou not my brother, I would not take this hand</li>
  <li>from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy</li>
  <li>tongue for saying so: thou hast railed on thyself.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ADAM</li>
  <li>Sweet masters, be patient: for your father's</li>
  <li class="number">remembrance, be at accord.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OLIVER</li>
  <li>Let me go, I say.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li>I will not, till I please: you shall hear me. My</li>
  <li>father charged you in his will to give me good</li>
  <li>education: you have trained me like a peasant,</li>
  <li class="number">obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like</li>
  <li>qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in</li>
  <li>me, and I will no longer endure it: therefore allow</li>
  <li>me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or</li>
  <li>give me the poor allottery my father left me by</li>
  <li class="number">testament; with that I will go buy my fortunes.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OLIVER</li>
  <li>And what wilt thou do? beg, when that is spent?</li>
  <li>Well, sir, get you in: I will not long be troubled</li>
  <li>with you; you shall have some part of your will: I</li>
  <li>pray you, leave me.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li class="number">I will no further offend you than becomes me for my good.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OLIVER</li>
  <li>Get you with him, you old dog.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ADAM</li>
  <li>Is 'old dog' my reward? Most true, I have lost my</li>
  <li>teeth in your service. God be with my old master!</li>
  <li>he would not have spoke such a word.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt ORLANDO and ADAM</div>

  <li class="speaker">OLIVER</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter CHARLES</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CHARLES</li>
  <li>Good morrow to your worship.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OLIVER</li>
  <li class="number">Good Monsieur Charles, what's the new news at the</li>
  <li>new court?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CHARLES</li>
  <li>There's no news at the court, sir, but the old news:</li>
  <li>that is, the old duke is banished by his younger</li>
  <li>brother the new duke; and three or four loving lords</li>
  <li class="number">have put themselves into voluntary exile with him,</li>
  <li>whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke;</li>
  <li>therefore he gives them good leave to wander.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OLIVER</li>
  <li>Can you tell if Rosalind, the duke's daughter, be</li>
  <li>banished with her father?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CHARLES</li>
  <li class="number">O, no; for the duke's daughter, her cousin, so loves</li>
  <li>her, being ever from their cradles bred together,</li>
  <li>that she would have followed her exile, or have died</li>
  <li>to stay behind her. She is at the court, and no</li>
  <li>less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter; and</li>
  <li class="number">never two ladies loved as they do.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OLIVER</li>
  <li>Where will the old duke live?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CHARLES</li>
  <li>They say he is already in the forest of Arden, and</li>
  <li>a many merry men with him; and there they live like</li>
  <li>the old Robin Hood of England: they say many young</li>
  <li class="number">gentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet the time</li>
  <li>carelessly, as they did in the golden world.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OLIVER</li>
  <li>What, you wrestle to-morrow before the new duke?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CHARLES</li>
  <li>Marry, do I, sir; and I came to acquaint you with a</li>
  <li>matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand</li>
  <li class="number">that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition</li>
  <li>to come in disguised against me to try a fall.</li>
  <li>To-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit; and he that</li>
  <li>escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him</li>
  <li>well. Your brother is but young and tender; and,</li>
  <li class="number">for your love, I would be loath to foil him, as I</li>
  <li>must, for my own honour, if he come in: therefore,</li>
  <li>out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you</li>
  <li>withal, that either you might stay him from his</li>
  <li>intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall</li>
  <li class="number">run into, in that it is a thing of his own search</li>
  <li>and altogether against my will.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OLIVER</li>
  <li>Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which</li>
  <li>thou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had</li>
  <li>myself notice of my brother's purpose herein and</li>
  <li class="number">have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from</li>
  <li>it, but he is resolute. I'll tell thee, Charles:</li>
  <li>it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full</li>
  <li>of ambition, an envious emulator of every man's</li>
  <li>good parts, a secret and villanous contriver against</li>
  <li class="number">me his natural brother: therefore use thy</li>
  <li>discretion; I had as lief thou didst break his neck</li>
  <li>as his finger. And thou wert best look to't; for if</li>
  <li>thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not</li>
  <li>mightily grace himself on thee, he will practise</li>
  <li class="number">against thee by poison, entrap thee by some</li>
  <li>treacherous device and never leave thee till he</li>
  <li>hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other;</li>
  <li>for, I assure thee, and almost with tears I speak</li>
  <li>it, there is not one so young and so villanous this</li>
  <li class="number">day living. I speak but brotherly of him; but</li>
  <li>should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must</li>
  <li>blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CHARLES</li>
  <li>I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come</li>
  <li>to-morrow, I'll give him his payment: if ever he go</li>
  <li class="number">alone again, I'll never wrestle for prize more: and</li>
  <li>so God keep your worship!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OLIVER</li>
  <li>Farewell, good Charles.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Exit CHARLES</li>
  <li>Now will I stir this gamester: I hope I shall see</li>
  <li>an end of him; for my soul, yet I know not why,</li>
  <li class="number">hates nothing more than he. Yet he's gentle, never</li>
  <li>schooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of</li>
  <li>all sorts enchantingly beloved, and indeed so much</li>
  <li>in the heart of the world, and especially of my own</li>
  <li>people, who best know him, that I am altogether</li>
  <li class="number">misprised: but it shall not be so long; this</li>
  <li>wrestler shall clear all: nothing remains but that</li>
  <li>I kindle the boy thither; which now I'll go about.</li>

<h3>SCENE II.  Lawn before the Duke's palace.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter CELIA and ROSALIND</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CELIA</li>
  <li>I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of;</li>
  <li>and would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could</li>
  <li>teach me to forget a banished father, you must not</li>
  <li class="number">learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CELIA</li>
  <li>Herein I see thou lovest me not with the full weight</li>
  <li>that I love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father,</li>
  <li>had banished thy uncle, the duke my father, so thou</li>
  <li>hadst been still with me, I could have taught my</li>
  <li class="number">love to take thy father for mine: so wouldst thou,</li>
  <li>if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously</li>
  <li>tempered as mine is to thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to</li>
  <li>rejoice in yours.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CELIA</li>
  <li class="number">You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is</li>
  <li>like to have: and, truly, when he dies, thou shalt</li>
  <li>be his heir, for what he hath taken away from thy</li>
  <li>father perforce, I will render thee again in</li>
  <li>affection; by mine honour, I will; and when I break</li>
  <li class="number">that oath, let me turn monster: therefore, my</li>
  <li>sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be merry.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports. Let</li>
  <li>me see; what think you of falling in love?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CELIA</li>
  <li>Marry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal: but</li>
  <li class="number">love no man in good earnest; nor no further in sport</li>
  <li>neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst</li>
  <li>in honour come off again.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>What shall be our sport, then?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CELIA</li>
  <li>Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from</li>
  <li class="number">her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>I would we could do so, for her benefits are</li>
  <li>mightily misplaced, and the bountiful blind woman</li>
  <li>doth most mistake in her gifts to women.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CELIA</li>
  <li>'Tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce</li>
  <li class="number">makes honest, and those that she makes honest she</li>
  <li>makes very ill-favouredly.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>Nay, now thou goest from Fortune's office to</li>
  <li>Nature's: Fortune reigns in gifts of the world,</li>
  <li>not in the lineaments of Nature.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter TOUCHSTONE</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CELIA</li>
  <li class="number">No? when Nature hath made a fair creature, may she</li>
  <li>not by Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature</li>
  <li>hath given us wit to flout at Fortune, hath not</li>
  <li>Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when</li>
  <li class="number">Fortune makes Nature's natural the cutter-off of</li>
  <li>Nature's wit.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CELIA</li>
  <li>Peradventure this is not Fortune's work neither, but</li>
  <li>Nature's; who perceiveth our natural wits too dull</li>
  <li>to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this</li>
  <li class="number">natural for our whetstone; for always the dulness of</li>
  <li>the fool is the whetstone of the wits. How now,</li>
  <li>wit! whither wander you?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TOUCHSTONE</li>
  <li>Mistress, you must come away to your father.</li>

  <li class="number">No, by mine honour, but I was bid to come for you.</li>

  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TOUCHSTONE</li>
  <li>Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they</li>

  <li class="number">pancakes were naught and the mustard was good, and</li>
  <li>yet was not the knight forsworn.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">

  <li>Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.</li>

  <li class="speaker">TOUCHSTONE</li>
  <li>By my knavery, if I had it, then I were; but if you</li>
  <li>swear by that that is not, you are not forsworn: no</li>
  <li class="number">more was this knight swearing by his honour, for he</li>
  <li>never had any; or if he had, he had sworn it away</li>
  <li>before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard.</li>

  <li class="speaker">LE BEAU</li>
  <li class="number">The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the</li>
  <li>duke's wrestler; which Charles in a moment threw him</li>
  <li>and broke three of his ribs, that there is little</li>
  <li>hope of life in him: so he served the second, and</li>
  <li>so the third. Yonder they lie; the poor old man,</li>
  <li class="number">their father, making such pitiful dole over them</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LE BEAU</li>
  <li>You must, if you stay here; for here is the place</li>

  <li class="speaker">CELIA</li>

  <li>your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my</li>
  <li>trial: wherein if I be foiled, there is but one</li>

  <li>dead that was willing to be so: I shall do my</li>

  <li>O my poor Rosalind, whither wilt thou go?</li>
  <li>Wilt thou change fathers? I will give thee mine.</li>
  <li>I charge thee, be not thou more grieved than I am.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>

  <li class="speaker">CELIA</li>
  <li>Thou hast not, cousin;</li>
  <li>Prithee be cheerful: know'st thou not, the duke</li>
  <li>Hath banish'd me, his daughter?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>That he hath not.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CELIA</li>
  <li class="number">No, hath not? Rosalind lacks then the love</li>
  <li>Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one:</li>
  <li>Shall we be sunder'd? shall we part, sweet girl?</li>
  <li>No: let my father seek another heir.</li>
  <li>Therefore devise with me how we may fly,</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CELIA</li>

  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>Alas, what danger will it be to us,</li>

  <li>Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CELIA</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>Were it not better,</li>

  <li>A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh,</li>
  <li>A boar-spear in my hand; and â€” in my heart</li>

  <li>But, cousin, what if we assay'd to steal</li>
  <li class="number">The clownish fool out of your father's court?</li>
  <li>Would he not be a comfort to our travel?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CELIA</li>
  <li>He'll go along o'er the wide world with me;</li>
  <li>Leave me alone to woo him. Let's away,</li>
  <li>And get our jewels and our wealth together,</li>
  <li class="number">Devise the fittest time and safest way</li>
  <li>To hide us from pursuit that will be made</li>
  <li>After my flight. Now go we in content</li>

<h3>SCENE I.  The Forest of Arden.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and two or three Lords,
like foresters</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DUKE SENIOR</li>
  <li>Now, my co-mates and brothers in exile,</li>
  <li>Hath not old custom made this life more sweet</li>
  <li>Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods</li>
  <li>More free from peril than the envious court?</li>
  <li class="number">Here feel we but the penalty of Adam,</li>
  <li>The seasons' difference, as the icy fang</li>
  <li>And churlish chiding of the winter's wind,</li>
  <li>Which, when it bites and blows upon my body,</li>
  <li>Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say</li>
  <li class="number">'This is no flattery: these are counsellors</li>
  <li>That feelingly persuade me what I am.'</li>
  <li>Sweet are the uses of adversity,</li>
  <li>Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,</li>
  <li>Wears yet a precious jewel in his head;</li>
  <li class="number">And this our life exempt from public haunt</li>
  <li>Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,</li>
  <li>Sermons in stones and good in every thing.</li>
  <li>I would not change it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">AMIENS</li>
  <li>Happy is your grace,</li>
  <li class="number">That can translate the stubbornness of fortune</li>
  <li>Into so quiet and so sweet a style.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DUKE SENIOR</li>
  <li>Come, shall we go and kill us venison?</li>
  <li>And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,</li>
  <li>Being native burghers of this desert city,</li>
  <li class="number">Should in their own confines with forked heads</li>
  <li>Have their round haunches gored.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Lord</li>
  <li>Indeed, my lord,</li>
  <li>The melancholy Jaques grieves at that,</li>
  <li>And, in that kind, swears you do more usurp</li>
  <li class="number">Than doth your brother that hath banish'd you.</li>
  <li>To-day my Lord of Amiens and myself</li>
  <li>Did steal behind him as he lay along</li>
  <li>Under an oak whose antique root peeps out</li>
  <li>Upon the brook that brawls along this wood:</li>
  <li class="number">To the which place a poor sequester'd stag,</li>
  <li>That from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt,</li>
  <li>Did come to languish, and indeed, my lord,</li>
  <li>The wretched animal heaved forth such groans</li>
  <li>That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat</li>
  <li class="number">Almost to bursting, and the big round tears</li>
  <li>Coursed one another down his innocent nose</li>
  <li>In piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool</li>
  <li>Much marked of the melancholy Jaques,</li>
  <li>Stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook,</li>
  <li class="number">Augmenting it with tears.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DUKE SENIOR</li>
  <li>But what said Jaques?</li>
  <li>Did he not moralize this spectacle?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Lord</li>
  <li>O, yes, into a thousand similes.</li>
  <li>First, for his weeping into the needless stream;</li>
  <li class="number">'Poor deer,' quoth he, 'thou makest a testament</li>
  <li>As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more</li>
  <li>To that which had too much:' then, being there alone,</li>
  <li>Left and abandon'd of his velvet friends,</li>
  <li>''Tis right:' quoth he; 'thus misery doth part</li>
  <li class="number">The flux of company:' anon a careless herd,</li>
  <li>Full of the pasture, jumps along by him</li>
  <li>And never stays to greet him; 'Ay' quoth Jaques,</li>
  <li>'Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens;</li>
  <li>'Tis just the fashion: wherefore do you look</li>
  <li class="number">Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?'</li>
  <li>Thus most invectively he pierceth through</li>
  <li>The body of the country, city, court,</li>
  <li>Yea, and of this our life, swearing that we</li>
  <li>Are mere usurpers, tyrants and what's worse,</li>
  <li class="number">To fright the animals and to kill them up</li>
  <li>In their assign'd and native dwelling-place.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DUKE SENIOR</li>
  <li>And did you leave him in this contemplation?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Lord</li>
  <li>We did, my lord, weeping and commenting</li>
  <li>Upon the sobbing deer.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DUKE SENIOR</li>
  <li class="number">Show me the place:</li>
  <li>I love to cope him in these sullen fits,</li>
  <li>For then he's full of matter.</li>
</ol>

  <li class="speaker">ADAM</li>
  <li>What, my young master? O, my gentle master!</li>
  <li>O my sweet master! O you memory</li>
  <li>Of old Sir Rowland! why, what make you here?</li>
  <li class="number">Why are you virtuous? why do people love you?</li>
  <li>And wherefore are you gentle, strong and valiant?</li>
  <li>Why would you be so fond to overcome</li>
  <li>The bonny priser of the humorous duke?</li>
  <li>Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.</li>
  <li class="number">Know you not, master, to some kind of men</li>
  <li>Their graces serve them but as enemies?</li>
  <li>No more do yours: your virtues, gentle master,</li>
  <li>Are sanctified and holy traitors to you.</li>
  <li>O, what a world is this, when what is comely</li>
  <li class="number">Envenoms him that bears it!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li>Why, what's the matter?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ADAM</li>
  <li>O unhappy youth!</li>
  <li>Come not within these doors; within this roof</li>
  <li>The enemy of all your graces lives:</li>
  <li class="number">Your brother â€” no, no brother; yet the son â€” </li>
  <li>Yet not the son, I will not call him son</li>
  <li>Of him I was about to call his father â€” </li>
  <li>Hath heard your praises, and this night he means</li>
  <li>To burn the lodging where you use to lie</li>
  <li class="number">And you within it: if he fail of that,</li>
  <li>He will have other means to cut you off.</li>
  <li>I overheard him and his practises.</li>
  <li>This is no place; this house is but a butchery:</li>
  <li>Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li class="number">Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ADAM</li>
  <li>No matter whither, so you come not here.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li>What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food?</li>
  <li>Or with a base and boisterous sword enforce</li>
  <li>A thievish living on the common road?</li>
  <li class="number">This I must do, or know not what to do:</li>
  <li>Yet this I will not do, do how I can;</li>
  <li>I rather will subject me to the malice</li>
  <li>Of a diverted blood and bloody brother.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ADAM</li>
  <li>But do not so. I have five hundred crowns,</li>
  <li class="number">The thrifty hire I saved under your father,</li>
  <li>Which I did store to be my foster-nurse</li>
  <li>When service should in my old limbs lie lame</li>
  <li>And unregarded age in corners thrown:</li>
  <li>Take that, and He that doth the ravens feed,</li>
  <li class="number">Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,</li>
  <li>Be comfort to my age! Here is the gold;</li>
  <li>And all this I give you. Let me be your servant:</li>
  <li>Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty;</li>
  <li>For in my youth I never did apply</li>
  <li class="number">Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,</li>
  <li>Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo</li>
  <li>The means of weakness and debility;</li>
  <li>Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,</li>
  <li>Frosty, but kindly: let me go with you;</li>
  <li class="number">I'll do the service of a younger man</li>
  <li>In all your business and necessities.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li>O good old man, how well in thee appears</li>
  <li>The constant service of the antique world,</li>
  <li>When service sweat for duty, not for meed!</li>
  <li class="number">Thou art not for the fashion of these times,</li>
  <li>Where none will sweat but for promotion,</li>
  <li>And having that, do choke their service up</li>
  <li>Even with the having: it is not so with thee.</li>
  <li>But, poor old man, thou prunest a rotten tree,</li>
  <li class="number">That cannot so much as a blossom yield</li>
  <li>In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry</li>
  <li>But come thy ways; well go along together,</li>
  <li>And ere we have thy youthful wages spent,</li>
  <li>We'll light upon some settled low content.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ADAM</li>
  <li class="number">Master, go on, and I will follow thee,</li>
  <li>To the last gasp, with truth and loyalty.</li>
  <li>From seventeen years till now almost fourscore</li>
  <li>Here lived I, but now live here no more.</li>
  <li>At seventeen years many their fortunes seek;</li>
  <li class="number">But at fourscore it is too late a week:</li>
  <li>Yet fortune cannot recompense me better</li>
  <li>Than to die well and not my master's debtor.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">JAQUES</li>
  <li>A fool, a fool! I met a fool i' the forest,</li>
  <li>A motley fool; a miserable world!</li>
  <li>As I do live by food, I met a fool</li>
  <li class="number">Who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun,</li>
  <li>And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms,</li>
  <li>In good set terms and yet a motley fool.</li>
  <li>'Good morrow, fool,' quoth I. 'No, sir,' quoth he,</li>
  <li>'Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune:'</li>
  <li class="number">And then he drew a dial from his poke,</li>
  <li>And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye,</li>
  <li>Says very wisely, 'It is ten o'clock:</li>
  <li>Thus we may see,' quoth he, 'how the world wags:</li>
  <li>'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine,</li>
  <li class="number">And after one hour more 'twill be eleven;</li>
  <li>And so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe,</li>
  <li>And then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot;</li>
  <li>And thereby hangs a tale.' When I did hear</li>
  <li>The motley fool thus moral on the time,</li>
  <li class="number">My lungs began to crow like chanticleer,</li>
  <li>That fools should be so deep-contemplative,</li>
  <li>And I did laugh sans intermission</li>
  <li>An hour by his dial. O noble fool!</li>
  <li>A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DUKE SENIOR</li>
  <li class="number">What fool is this?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">JAQUES</li>
  <li>O worthy fool! One that hath been a courtier,</li>
  <li>And says, if ladies be but young and fair,</li>
  <li>They have the gift to know it: and in his brain,</li>
  <li>Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit</li>
  <li class="number">After a voyage, he hath strange places cramm'd</li>
  <li>With observation, the which he vents</li>
  <li>In mangled forms. O that I were a fool!</li>
  <li>I am ambitious for a motley coat.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DUKE SENIOR</li>
  <li>Thou shalt have one.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">JAQUES</li>
  <li class="number">It is my only suit;</li>

  <li>That I am wise. I must have liberty</li>

  <li class="number">To blow on whom I please; for so fools have;</li>
  <li>And they that are most galled with my folly,</li>
  <li>They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so?</li>
  <li>The 'why' is plain as way to parish church:</li>
  <li>He that a fool doth very wisely hit</li>
  <li class="number">Doth very foolishly, although he smart,</li>
  <li>Not to seem senseless of the bob: if not,</li>
  <li>The wise man's folly is anatomized</li>

  <li>Invest me in my motley; give me leave</li>

  <li class="number">What woman in the city do I name,</li>

  <li>His folly to the mettle of my speech?</li>
  <li>There then; how then? what then? Let me see wherein</li>

  <li>Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time</li>
  <li>If ever you have look'd on better days,</li>

  <li>All the world's a stage,</li>

  <li class="number">And one man in his time plays many parts,</li>
  <li>His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,</li>
  <li>Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.</li>
  <li>And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel</li>
  <li>And shining morning face, creeping like snail</li>
  <li class="number">Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,</li>
  <li>Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad</li>
  <li>Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,</li>
  <li>Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,</li>
  <li>Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,</li>
  <li class="number">Seeking the bubble reputation</li>
  <li>Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,</li>
  <li>In fair round belly with good capon lined,</li>
  <li>With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,</li>
  <li>Full of wise saws and modern instances;</li>
  <li class="number">And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts</li>
  <li>Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,</li>
  <li>With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,</li>
  <li>His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide</li>
  <li>For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,</li>
  <li class="number">Turning again toward childish treble, pipes</li>
  <li>And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,</li>
  <li>That ends this strange eventful history,</li>
  <li>Is second childishness and mere oblivion,</li>

  <li class="speaker">CORIN</li>
  <li>And how like you this shepherd's life, Master Touchstone?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TOUCHSTONE</li>
  <li>Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good</li>
  <li>life, but in respect that it is a shepherd's life,</li>
  <li>it is naught. In respect that it is solitary, I</li>
  <li class="number">like it very well; but in respect that it is</li>
  <li>private, it is a very vile life. Now, in respect it</li>
  <li>is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in</li>
  <li>respect it is not in the court, it is tedious. As</li>
  <li>is it a spare life, look you, it fits my humour well;</li>
  <li class="number">but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much</li>
  <li>against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CORIN</li>
  <li>No more but that I know the more one sickens the</li>
  <li>worse at ease he is; and that he that wants money,</li>
  <li>means and content is without three good friends;</li>
  <li class="number">that the property of rain is to wet and fire to</li>
  <li>burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep, and that a</li>
  <li>great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that</li>
  <li>he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may</li>
  <li>complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TOUCHSTONE</li>
  <li class="number">Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in</li>
  <li>court, shepherd?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CORIN</li>
  <li>No, truly.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TOUCHSTONE</li>
  <li>Then thou art damned.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CORIN</li>
  <li>Nay, I hope.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TOUCHSTONE</li>
  <li class="number">Truly, thou art damned like an ill-roasted egg, all</li>
  <li>on one side.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CORIN</li>
  <li>For not being at court? Your reason.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TOUCHSTONE</li>
  <li>Why, if thou never wast at court, thou never sawest</li>
  <li>good manners; if thou never sawest good manners,</li>
  <li class="number">then thy manners must be wicked; and wickedness is</li>
  <li>sin, and sin is damnation. Thou art in a parlous</li>
  <li>state, shepherd.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CORIN</li>
  <li>Not a whit, Touchstone: those that are good manners</li>
  <li>at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the</li>
  <li class="number">behavior of the country is most mockable at the</li>
  <li>court. You told me you salute not at the court, but</li>
  <li>you kiss your hands: that courtesy would be</li>
  <li>uncleanly, if courtiers were shepherds.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TOUCHSTONE</li>
  <li>Instance, briefly; come, instance.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CORIN</li>
  <li class="number">Why, we are still handling our ewes, and their</li>
  <li>fells, you know, are greasy.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TOUCHSTONE</li>
  <li>Why, do not your courtier's hands sweat? and is not</li>
  <li>the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of</li>
  <li>a man? Shallow, shallow. A better instance, I say; come.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CORIN</li>
  <li class="number">Besides, our hands are hard.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TOUCHSTONE</li>
  <li>Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again.</li>
  <li>A more sounder instance, come.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CORIN</li>
  <li>And they are often tarred over with the surgery of</li>
  <li>our sheep: and would you have us kiss tar? The</li>
  <li class="number">courtier's hands are perfumed with civet.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TOUCHSTONE</li>
  <li>Most shallow man! thou worms-meat, in respect of a</li>
  <li>good piece of flesh indeed! Learn of the wise, and</li>
  <li>perpend: civet is of a baser birth than tar, the</li>
  <li>very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend the instance, shepherd.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CORIN</li>
  <li class="number">You have too courtly a wit for me: I'll rest.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TOUCHSTONE</li>
  <li>Wilt thou rest damned? God help thee, shallow man!</li>
  <li>God make incision in thee! thou art raw.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CORIN</li>
  <li>Sir, I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat, get</li>
  <li>that I wear, owe no man hate, envy no man's</li>
  <li class="number">happiness, glad of other men's good, content with my</li>
  <li>harm, and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes</li>
  <li>graze and my lambs suck.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TOUCHSTONE</li>
  <li>That is another simple sin in you, to bring the ewes</li>
  <li>and the rams together and to offer to get your</li>
  <li class="number">living by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a</li>
  <li>bell-wether, and to betray a she-lamb of a</li>
  <li>twelvemonth to a crooked-pated, old, cuckoldly ram,</li>
  <li>out of all reasonable match. If thou beest not</li>
  <li>damned for this, the devil himself will have no</li>
  <li class="number">shepherds; I cannot see else how thou shouldst</li>
  <li>'scape.</li>

  <li>I'll graff it with you, and then I shall graff it</li>
  <li>with a medlar: then it will be the earliest fruit</li>

  <li class="number">Why should this a desert be?</li>

  <li>Some, of violated vows</li>

  <li class="speaker">CELIA</li>
  <li>Didst thou hear these verses?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>O, yes, I heard them all, and more too; for some of</li>
  <li>them had in them more feet than the verses would bear.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CELIA</li>
  <li class="number">That's no matter: the feet might bear the verses.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>Ay, but the feet were lame and could not bear</li>
  <li>themselves without the verse and therefore stood</li>
  <li>lamely in the verse.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CELIA</li>
  <li>But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name</li>
  <li class="number">should be hanged and carved upon these trees?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder</li>
  <li>before you came; for look here what I found on a</li>
  <li>palm-tree. I was never so be-rhymed since</li>
  <li>Pythagoras' time, that I was an Irish rat, which I</li>

  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>Is it a man?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CELIA</li>
  <li>And a chain, that you once wore, about his neck.</li>
  <li>Change you colour?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li class="number">I prithee, who?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CELIA</li>
  <li>O Lord, Lord! it is a hard matter for friends to</li>

  <li>and so encounter.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>Nay, but who is it?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CELIA</li>
  <li class="number">Is it possible?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>Nay, I prithee now with most petitionary vehemence,</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CELIA</li>
  <li>O wonderful, wonderful, and most wonderful</li>
  <li>wonderful! and yet again wonderful, and after that,</li>
  <li class="number">out of all hooping!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>Good my complexion! dost thou think, though I am</li>
  <li>caparisoned like a man, I have a doublet and hose in</li>
  <li>my disposition? One inch of delay more is a</li>
  <li>South-sea of discovery; I prithee, tell me who is it</li>
  <li class="number">quickly, and speak apace. I would thou couldst</li>
  <li>stammer, that thou mightst pour this concealed man</li>
  <li>out of thy mouth, as wine comes out of a narrow-</li>
  <li>mouthed bottle, either too much at once, or none at</li>
  <li>all. I prithee, take the cork out of thy mouth that</li>
  <li class="number">may drink thy tidings.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CELIA</li>
  <li>So you may put a man in your belly.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>Is he of God's making? What manner of man? Is his</li>
  <li>head worth a hat, or his chin worth a beard?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CELIA</li>
  <li>Nay, he hath but a little beard.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li class="number">Why, God will send more, if the man will be</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>Then there is no true lover in the forest; else</li>
  <li>sighing every minute and groaning every hour would</li>
  <li>detect the lazy foot of Time as well as a clock.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li>And why not the swift foot of Time? had not that</li>
  <li class="number">been as proper?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>By no means, sir: Time travels in divers paces with</li>
  <li>divers persons. I'll tell you who Time ambles</li>
  <li>withal, who Time trots withal, who Time gallops</li>
  <li>withal and who he stands still withal.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li class="number">I prithee, who doth he trot withal?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>Marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the</li>
  <li>contract of her marriage and the day it is</li>
  <li>solemnized: if the interim be but a se'nnight,</li>
  <li>Time's pace is so hard that it seems the length of</li>
  <li class="number">seven year.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li>Who ambles Time withal?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that</li>
  <li>hath not the gout, for the one sleeps easily because</li>
  <li>he cannot study, and the other lives merrily because</li>
  <li class="number">he feels no pain, the one lacking the burden of lean</li>
  <li>and wasteful learning, the other knowing no burden</li>
  <li>of heavy tedious penury; these Time ambles withal.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li>Who doth he gallop withal?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>With a thief to the gallows, for though he go as</li>
  <li class="number">softly as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li>Who stays it still withal?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>With lawyers in the vacation, for they sleep between</li>
  <li>term and term and then they perceive not how Time moves.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li>Where dwell you, pretty youth?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li class="number">With this shepherdess, my sister; here in the</li>
  <li>skirts of the forest, like fringe upon a petticoat.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li>Are you native of this place?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>As the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li>Your accent is something finer than you could</li>
  <li class="number">purchase in so removed a dwelling.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>I have been told so of many: but indeed an old</li>
  <li>religious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was</li>
  <li>in his youth an inland man; one that knew courtship</li>
  <li>too well, for there he fell in love. I have heard</li>
  <li class="number">him read many lectures against it, and I thank God</li>
  <li>I am not a woman, to be touched with so many</li>
  <li>giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their</li>
  <li>whole sex withal.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li>Can you remember any of the principal evils that he</li>
  <li class="number">laid to the charge of women?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>There were none principal; they were all like one</li>
  <li>another as half-pence are, every one fault seeming</li>
  <li>monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li>I prithee, recount some of them.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li class="number">No, I will not cast away my physic but on those that</li>
  <li>are sick. There is a man haunts the forest, that</li>
  <li>abuses our young plants with carving 'Rosalind' on</li>
  <li>their barks; hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies</li>
  <li>on brambles, all, forsooth, deifying the name of</li>
  <li class="number">Rosalind: if I could meet that fancy-monger I would</li>
  <li>give him some good counsel, for he seems to have the</li>
  <li>quotidian of love upon him.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li>I am he that is so love-shaked: I pray you tell me</li>
  <li>your remedy.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li class="number">There is none of my uncle's marks upon you: he</li>
  <li>taught me how to know a man in love; in which cage</li>
  <li>of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li>What were his marks?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>A lean cheek, which you have not, a blue eye and</li>
  <li class="number">sunken, which you have not, an unquestionable</li>
  <li>spirit, which you have not, a beard neglected,</li>
  <li>which you have not; but I pardon you for that, for</li>
  <li>simply your having in beard is a younger brother's</li>
  <li>revenue: then your hose should be ungartered, your</li>
  <li class="number">bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe</li>
  <li>untied and every thing about you demonstrating a</li>
  <li>careless desolation; but you are no such man; you</li>
  <li>are rather point-device in your accoutrements as</li>
  <li>loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li class="number">Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>Me believe it! you may as soon make her that you</li>
  <li>love believe it; which, I warrant, she is apter to</li>
  <li>do than to confess she does: that is one of the</li>
  <li>points in the which women still give the lie to</li>
  <li class="number">their consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he</li>
  <li>that hangs the verses on the trees, wherein Rosalind</li>
  <li>is so admired?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li>I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of</li>
  <li>Rosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li class="number">But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li>Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>Love is merely a madness, and, I tell you, deserves</li>
  <li>as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do: and</li>
  <li>the reason why they are not so punished and cured</li>
  <li class="number">is, that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers</li>
  <li>are in love too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li>Did you ever cure any so?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>Yes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine me</li>
  <li>his love, his mistress; and I set him every day to</li>
  <li class="number">woo me: at which time would I, being but a moonish</li>
  <li>youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing</li>
  <li>and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow,</li>
  <li>inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles, for every</li>
  <li>passion something and for no passion truly any</li>
  <li class="number">thing, as boys and women are for the most part</li>
  <li>cattle of this colour; would now like him, now loathe</li>
  <li>him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep</li>
  <li>for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor</li>
  <li>from his mad humour of love to a living humour of</li>
  <li class="number">madness; which was, to forswear the full stream of</li>
  <li>the world, and to live in a nook merely monastic.</li>
  <li>And thus I cured him; and this way will I take upon</li>
  <li>me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's</li>
  <li>heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in't.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li class="number">I would not be cured, youth.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind</li>
  <li>and come every day to my cote and woo me.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li>Now, by the faith of my love, I will: tell me</li>
  <li>where it is.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li class="number">Go with me to it and I'll show it you and by the way</li>
  <li>you shall tell me where in the forest you live.</li>
  <li>Will you go?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li>With all my heart, good youth.</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">AUDREY</li>
  <li>Your features! Lord warrant us! what features!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TOUCHSTONE</li>
  <li class="number">I am here with thee and thy goats, as the most</li>
  <li>capricious poet, honest Ovid, was among the Goths.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">JAQUES</li>
  <li>Aside  O knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than Jove</li>
  <li>in a thatched house!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TOUCHSTONE</li>
  <li>When a man's verses cannot be understood, nor a</li>
  <li class="number">man's good wit seconded with the forward child</li>
  <li>Understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a</li>
  <li>great reckoning in a little room. Truly, I would</li>
  <li>the gods had made thee poetical.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">AUDREY</li>
  <li>I do not know what 'poetical' is: is it honest in</li>
  <li class="number">deed and word? is it a true thing?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TOUCHSTONE</li>
  <li>No, truly; for the truest poetry is the most</li>
  <li>feigning; and lovers are given to poetry, and what</li>
  <li>they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">AUDREY</li>
  <li>Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TOUCHSTONE</li>
  <li class="number">I do, truly; for thou swearest to me thou art</li>
  <li>honest: now, if thou wert a poet, I might have some</li>
  <li>hope thou didst feign.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">AUDREY</li>
  <li>Would you not have me honest?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TOUCHSTONE</li>
  <li>No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favoured; for</li>
  <li class="number">honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">JAQUES</li>
  <li>Aside  A material fool!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">AUDREY</li>
  <li>Well, I am not fair; and therefore I pray the gods</li>
  <li>make me honest.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TOUCHSTONE</li>
  <li>Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut</li>
  <li class="number">were to put good meat into an unclean dish.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">AUDREY</li>
  <li>I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TOUCHSTONE</li>
  <li>Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness!</li>
  <li>sluttishness may come hereafter. But be it as it may</li>
  <li>be, I will marry thee, and to that end I have been</li>
  <li class="number">with Sir Oliver Martext, the vicar of the next</li>
  <li>village, who hath promised to meet me in this place</li>
  <li>of the forest and to couple us.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">JAQUES</li>
  <li>Aside  I would fain see this meeting.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">AUDREY</li>
  <li>Well, the gods give us joy!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TOUCHSTONE</li>
  <li class="number">Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart,</li>
  <li>stagger in this attempt; for here we have no temple</li>
  <li>but the wood, no assembly but horn-beasts. But what</li>
  <li>though? Courage! As horns are odious, they are</li>
  <li>necessary. It is said, 'many a man knows no end of</li>
  <li class="number">his goods:' right; many a man has good horns, and</li>
  <li>knows no end of them. Well, that is the dowry of</li>
  <li>his wife; 'tis none of his own getting. Horns?</li>
  <li>Even so. Poor men alone? No, no; the noblest deer</li>
  <li>hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man</li>
  <li class="number">therefore blessed? No: as a walled town is more</li>
  <li>worthier than a village, so is the forehead of a</li>
  <li>married man more honourable than the bare brow of a</li>
  <li>bachelor; and by how much defence is better than no</li>
  <li>skill, by so much is a horn more precious than to</li>
  <li class="number">want. Here comes Sir Oliver.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Enter SIR OLIVER MARTEXT</li>
  <li>Sir Oliver Martext, you are well met: will you</li>
  <li>dispatch us here under this tree, or shall we go</li>

  <li class="speaker">TOUCHSTONE</li>
  <li>Good even, good Master What-ye-call't: how do you,</li>

  <li>as pigeons bill, so wedlock would be nibbling.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">JAQUES</li>
  <li>And will you, being a man of your breeding, be</li>
  <li>married under a bush like a beggar? Get you to</li>
  <li>church, and have a good priest that can tell you</li>
  <li class="number">what marriage is: this fellow will but join you</li>
  <li>together as they join wainscot; then one of you will</li>
  <li>prove a shrunk panel and, like green timber, warp, warp.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TOUCHSTONE</li>
  <li>Aside  I am not in the mind but I were better to be</li>
  <li>married of him than of another: for he is not like</li>
  <li class="number">to marry me well; and not being well married, it</li>
  <li>will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife.</li>

<ol class="speech">

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SILVIUS</li>
  <li>Sweet Phebe, do not scorn me; do not, Phebe;</li>
  <li>Say that you love me not, but say not so</li>
  <li>In bitterness. The common executioner,</li>
  <li>Whose heart the accustom'd sight of death makes hard,</li>
  <li class="number">Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck</li>
  <li>But first begs pardon: will you sterner be</li>
  <li>Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops?</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and CORIN, behind</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PHEBE</li>
  <li>I would not be thy executioner:</li>
  <li>I fly thee, for I would not injure thee.</li>
  <li class="number">Thou tell'st me there is murder in mine eye:</li>
  <li>'Tis pretty, sure, and very probable,</li>
  <li>That eyes, that are the frail'st and softest things,</li>
  <li>Who shut their coward gates on atomies,</li>
  <li>Should be call'd tyrants, butchers, murderers!</li>
  <li class="number">Now I do frown on thee with all my heart;</li>
  <li>And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee:</li>
  <li>Now counterfeit to swoon; why now fall down;</li>
  <li>Or if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame,</li>
  <li>Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers!</li>
  <li class="number">Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee:</li>
  <li>Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains</li>
  <li>Some scar of it; lean but upon a rush,</li>
  <li>The cicatrice and capable impressure</li>
  <li>Thy palm some moment keeps; but now mine eyes,</li>
  <li class="number">Which I have darted at thee, hurt thee not,</li>
  <li>Nor, I am sure, there is no force in eyes</li>
  <li>That can do hurt.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SILVIUS</li>
  <li>O dear Phebe,</li>
  <li>If ever â€”  as that ever may be near â€”  </li>
  <li class="number">You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy,</li>
  <li>Then shall you know the wounds invisible</li>
  <li>That love's keen arrows make.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PHEBE</li>
  <li>But till that time</li>
  <li>Come not thou near me: and when that time comes,</li>
  <li class="number">Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not;</li>
  <li>As till that time I shall not pity thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>And why, I pray you? Who might be your mother,</li>
  <li>That you insult, exult, and all at once,</li>
  <li>Over the wretched? What though you have no beauty â€”  </li>
  <li class="number">As, by my faith, I see no more in you</li>
  <li>Than without candle may go dark to bed â€” </li>
  <li>Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?</li>
  <li>Why, what means this? Why do you look on me?</li>
  <li>I see no more in you than in the ordinary</li>
  <li class="number">Of nature's sale-work. 'Od's my little life,</li>
  <li>I think she means to tangle my eyes too!</li>
  <li>No, faith, proud mistress, hope not after it:</li>
  <li>'Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,</li>
  <li>Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,</li>
  <li class="number">That can entame my spirits to your worship.</li>
  <li>You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,</li>
  <li>Like foggy south puffing with wind and rain?</li>
  <li>You are a thousand times a properer man</li>
  <li>Than she a woman: 'tis such fools as you</li>
  <li class="number">That makes the world full of ill-favour'd children:</li>
  <li>'Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her;</li>
  <li>And out of you she sees herself more proper</li>
  <li>Than any of her lineaments can show her.</li>
  <li>But, mistress, know yourself: down on your knees,</li>
  <li class="number">And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man's love:</li>
  <li>For I must tell you friendly in your ear,</li>
  <li>Sell when you can: you are not for all markets:</li>
  <li>Cry the man mercy; love him; take his offer:</li>
  <li>Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer.</li>
  <li class="number">So take her to thee, shepherd: fare you well.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PHEBE</li>
  <li>Sweet youth, I pray you, chide a year together:</li>
  <li>I had rather hear you chide than this man woo.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>He's fallen in love with your foulness and she'll</li>
  <li>fall in love with my anger. If it be so, as fast as</li>
  <li class="number">she answers thee with frowning looks, I'll sauce her</li>
  <li>with bitter words. Why look you so upon me?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PHEBE</li>
  <li>For no ill will I bear you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>I pray you, do not fall in love with me,</li>
  <li>For I am falser than vows made in wine:</li>
  <li class="number">Besides, I like you not. If you will know my house,</li>
  <li>'Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by.</li>
  <li>Will you go, sister? Shepherd, ply her hard.</li>
  <li>Come, sister. Shepherdess, look on him better,</li>
  <li>And be not proud: though all the world could see,</li>
  <li class="number">None could be so abused in sight as he.</li>
  <li>Come, to our flock.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt ROSALIND, CELIA and CORIN</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PHEBE</li>
  <li>Dead Shepherd, now I find thy saw of might,</li>
  <li>'Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?'</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SILVIUS</li>
  <li>Sweet Phebe â€”  </li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PHEBE</li>
  <li class="number">Ha, what say'st thou, Silvius?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SILVIUS</li>
  <li>Sweet Phebe, pity me.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PHEBE</li>
  <li>Why, I am sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SILVIUS</li>
  <li>Wherever sorrow is, relief would be:</li>
  <li>If you do sorrow at my grief in love,</li>
  <li class="number">By giving love your sorrow and my grief</li>
  <li>Were both extermined.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PHEBE</li>
  <li>Thou hast my love: is not that neighbourly?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SILVIUS</li>
  <li>I would have you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PHEBE</li>
  <li>Why, that were covetousness.</li>
  <li class="number">Silvius, the time was that I hated thee,</li>
  <li>And yet it is not that I bear thee love;</li>
  <li>But since that thou canst talk of love so well,</li>
  <li>Thy company, which erst was irksome to me,</li>
  <li>I will endure, and I'll employ thee too:</li>
  <li class="number">But do not look for further recompense</li>
  <li>Than thine own gladness that thou art employ'd.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SILVIUS</li>
  <li>So holy and so perfect is my love,</li>
  <li>And I in such a poverty of grace,</li>
  <li>That I shall think it a most plenteous crop</li>
  <li class="number">To glean the broken ears after the man</li>
  <li>That the main harvest reaps: loose now and then</li>
  <li>A scatter'd smile, and that I'll live upon.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PHEBE</li>
  <li>Know'st now the youth that spoke to me erewhile?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SILVIUS</li>
  <li>Not very well, but I have met him oft;</li>
  <li class="number">And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds</li>
  <li>That the old carlot once was master of.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PHEBE</li>
  <li>Think not I love him, though I ask for him:</li>
  <li>'Tis but a peevish boy; yet he talks well;</li>
  <li>But what care I for words? yet words do well</li>
  <li class="number">When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.</li>
  <li>It is a pretty youth: not very pretty:</li>
  <li>But, sure, he's proud, and yet his pride becomes him:</li>
  <li>He'll make a proper man: the best thing in him</li>
  <li>Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue</li>
  <li class="number">Did make offence his eye did heal it up.</li>
  <li>He is not very tall; yet for his years he's tall:</li>
  <li>His leg is but so so; and yet 'tis well:</li>
  <li>There was a pretty redness in his lip,</li>
  <li>A little riper and more lusty red</li>
  <li class="number">Than that mix'd in his cheek; 'twas just the difference</li>
  <li>Between the constant red and mingled damask.</li>
  <li>There be some women, Silvius, had they mark'd him</li>
  <li>In parcels as I did, would have gone near</li>
  <li>To fall in love with him; but, for my part,</li>
  <li class="number">I love him not nor hate him not; and yet</li>
  <li>I have more cause to hate him than to love him:</li>
  <li>For what had he to do to chide at me?</li>
  <li>He said mine eyes were black and my hair black:</li>
  <li>And, now I am remember'd, scorn'd at me:</li>
  <li class="number">I marvel why I answer'd not again:</li>
  <li>But that's all one; omittance is no quittance.</li>
  <li>I'll write to him a very taunting letter,</li>
  <li>And thou shalt bear it: wilt thou, Silvius?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SILVIUS</li>
  <li>Phebe, with all my heart.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PHEBE</li>
  <li class="number">I'll write it straight;</li>
  <li>The matter's in my head and in my heart:</li>
  <li>I will be bitter with him and passing short.</li>
  <li>Go with me, Silvius.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">JAQUES</li>
  <li>I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted</li>
  <li>with thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>They say you are a melancholy fellow.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">JAQUES</li>
  <li>I am so; I do love it better than laughing.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li class="number">Those that are in extremity of either are abominable</li>
  <li>fellows and betray themselves to every modern</li>
  <li>censure worse than drunkards.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">JAQUES</li>
  <li>Why, 'tis good to be sad and say nothing.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>Why then, 'tis good to be a post.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">JAQUES</li>
  <li class="number">I have neither the scholar's melancholy, which is</li>
  <li>emulation, nor the musician's, which is fantastical,</li>
  <li>nor the courtier's, which is proud, nor the</li>
  <li>soldier's, which is ambitious, nor the lawyer's,</li>
  <li>which is politic, nor the lady's, which is nice, nor</li>
  <li class="number">the lover's, which is all these: but it is a</li>
  <li>melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples,</li>
  <li>extracted from many objects, and indeed the sundry's</li>
  <li>contemplation of my travels, in which my often</li>
  <li>rumination wraps me m a most humorous sadness.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li class="number">A traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to</li>
  <li>be sad: I fear you have sold your own lands to see</li>
  <li>other men's; then, to have seen much and to have</li>
  <li>nothing, is to have rich eyes and poor hands.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">JAQUES</li>
  <li>Yes, I have gained my experience.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li class="number">And your experience makes you sad: I had rather have</li>
  <li>a fool to make me merry than experience to make me</li>
  <li>sad; and to travel for it too!</li>

  <li>Nay, then, God be wi' you, an you talk in blank verse.</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li class="number">Farewell, Monsieur Traveller: look you lisp and</li>
  <li>wear strange suits, disable all the benefits of your</li>
  <li>own country, be out of love with your nativity and</li>
  <li>almost chide God for making you that countenance you</li>
  <li>are, or I will scarce think you have swam in a</li>
  <li class="number">gondola. Why, how now, Orlando! where have you been</li>
  <li>all this while? You a lover! An you serve me such</li>
  <li>another trick, never come in my sight more.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li>My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>Break an hour's promise in love! He that will</li>
  <li class="number">divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but</li>
  <li>a part of the thousandth part of a minute in the</li>
  <li>affairs of love, it may be said of him that Cupid</li>
  <li>hath clapped him o' the shoulder, but I'll warrant</li>
  <li>him heart-whole.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li class="number">Pardon me, dear Rosalind.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight: I</li>
  <li>had as lief be wooed of a snail.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li>Of a snail?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>Ay, of a snail; for though he comes slowly, he</li>
  <li class="number">carries his house on his head; a better jointure,</li>
  <li>I think, than you make a woman: besides he brings</li>
  <li>his destiny with him.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li>What's that?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>Why, horns, which such as you are fain to be</li>
  <li class="number">beholding to your wives for: but he comes armed in</li>
  <li>his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li>Virtue is no horn-maker; and my Rosalind is virtuous.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>And I am your Rosalind.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CELIA</li>
  <li>It pleases him to call you so; but he hath a</li>
  <li class="number">Rosalind of a better leer than you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>Come, woo me, woo me, for now I am in a holiday</li>
  <li>humour and like enough to consent. What would you</li>
  <li>say to me now, an I were your very very Rosalind?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li>I would kiss before I spoke.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li class="number">Nay, you were better speak first, and when you were</li>
  <li>gravelled for lack of matter, you might take</li>
  <li>occasion to kiss. Very good orators, when they are</li>
  <li>out, they will spit; and for lovers lacking â€” God</li>
  <li>warn us! â€” matter, the cleanliest shift is to kiss.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li class="number">How if the kiss be denied?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new matter.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li>Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>Marry, that should you, if I were your mistress, or</li>
  <li>I should think my honesty ranker than my wit.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li class="number">What, of my suit?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit.</li>
  <li>Am not I your Rosalind?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li>I take some joy to say you are, because I would be</li>
  <li>talking of her.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li class="number">Well in her person I say I will not have you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li>Then in mine own person I die.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is</li>
  <li>almost six thousand years old, and in all this time</li>
  <li>there was not any man died in his own person,</li>
  <li class="number">videlicit, in a love-cause. Troilus had his brains</li>
  <li>dashed out with a Grecian club; yet he did what he</li>
  <li>could to die before, and he is one of the patterns</li>
  <li>of love. Leander, he would have lived many a fair</li>
  <li>year, though Hero had turned nun, if it had not been</li>
  <li class="number">for a hot midsummer night; for, good youth, he went</li>
  <li>but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and being</li>
  <li>taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish</li>
  <li>coroners of that age found it was 'Hero of Sestos.'</li>
  <li>But these are all lies: men have died from time to</li>
  <li class="number">time and worms have eaten them, but not for love.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li>I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind,</li>
  <li>for, I protest, her frown might kill me.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now</li>
  <li>I will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on</li>
  <li class="number">disposition, and ask me what you will. I will grant</li>
  <li>it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li>Then love me, Rosalind.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays and all.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li>And wilt thou have me?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li class="number">Ay, and twenty such.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li>What sayest thou?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>Are you not good?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li>I hope so.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing?</li>
  <li class="number">Come, sister, you shall be the priest and marry us.</li>
  <li>Give me your hand, Orlando. What do you say, sister?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li>Pray thee, marry us.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CELIA</li>
  <li>I cannot say the words.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>You must begin, 'Will you, Orlando â€” '</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CELIA</li>
  <li class="number">Go to. Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li>I will.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>Ay, but when?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li>Why now; as fast as she can marry us.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>Then you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.'</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li class="number">I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>I might ask you for your commission; but I do take</li>
  <li>thee, Orlando, for my husband: there's a girl goes</li>
  <li>before the priest; and certainly a woman's thought</li>
  <li>runs before her actions.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li class="number">So do all thoughts; they are winged.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>Now tell me how long you would have her after you</li>
  <li>have possessed her.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li>For ever and a day.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>
  <li>Say 'a day,' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando;</li>
  <li class="number">men are April when they woo, December when they wed:</li>
  <li>maids are May when they are maids, but the sky</li>
  <li>changes when they are wives. I will be more jealous</li>
  <li>of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen,</li>
  <li>more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more</li>
  <li class="number">new-fangled than an ape, more giddy in my desires</li>
  <li>than a monkey: I will weep for nothing, like Diana</li>
  <li>in the fountain, and I will do that when you are</li>
  <li>disposed to be merry; I will laugh like a hyen, and</li>
  <li>that when thou art inclined to sleep.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ORLANDO</li>
  <li class="number">But will my Rosalind do so?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROSALIND</li>

  <li>And high top bald with dry antiquity,</li>
  <li>A wretched ragged man, o'ergrown with hair,</li>
  <li class="number">Lay sleeping on his back: about his neck</li>
  <li>A green and gilded snake had wreathed itself,</li>
  <li>Who with her head nimble in threats approach'd</li>
  <li>The opening of his mouth; but suddenly,</li>
  <li>Seeing Orlando, it unlink'd itself,</li>
  <li class="number">And with indented glides did slip away</li>
  <li>Into a bush: under which bush's shade</li>
  <li>A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,</li>
  <li>Lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch,</li>
  <li>When that the sleeping man should stir; for 'tis</li>

  <li>Twice did he turn his back and purposed so;</li>

  <li>Who led me instantly unto his cave,</li>
  <li>There stripp'd himself, and here upon his arm</li>
  <li>The lioness had torn some flesh away,</li>
  <li>Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted</li>
  <li class="number">And cried, in fainting, upon Rosalind.</li>
  <li>Brief, I recover'd him, bound up his wound;</li>

  <li>together is, abandon the society of this female, or,</li>
  <li>clown, thou perishest; or, to thy better</li>
  <li>understanding, diest; or, to wit I kill thee, make</li>
  <li class="number">thee away, translate thy life into death, thy</li>
  <li>liberty into bondage: I will deal in poison with</li>
  <li>thee, or in bastinado, or in steel; I will bandy</li>

  <li>as your gesture cries it out, when your brother</li>

  <li>if I said his beard was not cut well, he was in the</li>
  <li>mind it was: this is called the Retort Courteous.</li>
  <li>If I sent him word again 'it was not well cut,' he</li>
  <li class="number">would send me word, he cut it to please himself:</li>
  <li>this is called the Quip Modest. If again 'it was</li>
  <li>not well cut,' he disabled my judgment: this is</li>
  <li>called the Reply Churlish. If again 'it was not</li>
  <li>well cut,' he would answer, I spake not true: this</li>
  <li class="number">is called the Reproof Valiant. If again 'it was not</li>
  <li>well cut,' he would say I lied: this is called the</li>
  <li>Counter-cheque Quarrelsome: and so to the Lie</li>
  <li>Circumstantial and the Lie Direct.</li>

  <li class="number">I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial,</li>
  <li>nor he durst not give me the Lie Direct; and so we</li>
  <li>measured swords and parted.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">JAQUES</li>
  <li>Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TOUCHSTONE</li>
  <li>O sir, we quarrel in print, by the book; as you have</li>
  <li class="number">books for good manners: I will name you the degrees.</li>
  <li>The first, the Retort Courteous; the second, the</li>
  <li>Quip Modest; the third, the Reply Churlish; the</li>
  <li>fourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fifth, the</li>
  <li>Countercheque Quarrelsome; the sixth, the Lie with</li>
  <li class="number">Circumstance; the seventh, the Lie Direct. All</li>
  <li>these you may avoid but the Lie Direct; and you may</li>
  <li>avoid that too, with an If. I knew when seven</li>
  <li>justices could not take up a quarrel, but when the</li>
  <li>parties were met themselves, one of them thought but</li>
  <li class="number">of an If, as, 'If you said so, then I said so;' and</li>
  <li>they shook hands and swore brothers. Your If is the</li>
  <li>only peacemaker; much virtue in If.</li>
