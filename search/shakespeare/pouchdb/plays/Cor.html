<div class="stage-direction">Enter a company of mutinous Citizens, with staves,
clubs, and other weapons</div>

  <li class="speaker">First Citizen</li>
  <li>Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">All</li>
  <li>Speak, speak.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Citizen</li>
  <li>You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">All</li>
  <li>Resolved. resolved.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Citizen</li>
  <li class="number">First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">All</li>
  <li>We know't, we know't.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Citizen</li>
  <li>Let us kill him, and we'll have corn at our own price.</li>
  <li>Is't a verdict?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">All</li>
  <li>No more talking on't; let it be done: away, away!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Citizen</li>
  <li class="number">One word, good citizens.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Citizen</li>
  <li>We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good.</li>
  <li>What authority surfeits on would relieve us: if they</li>
  <li>would yield us but the superfluity, while it were</li>
  <li>wholesome, we might guess they relieved us humanely;</li>
  <li class="number">but they think we are too dear: the leanness that</li>
  <li>afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an</li>
  <li>inventory to particularise their abundance; our</li>
  <li>sufferance is a gain to them Let us revenge this with</li>
  <li>our pikes, ere we become rakes: for the gods know I</li>
  <li class="number">speak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Citizen</li>
  <li>Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">All</li>
  <li>Against him first: he's a very dog to the commonalty.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Citizen</li>
  <li>Consider you what services he has done for his country?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Citizen</li>
  <li>Very well; and could be content to give him good</li>
  <li class="number">report fort, but that he pays himself with being proud.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Citizen</li>
  <li>Nay, but speak not maliciously.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Citizen</li>
  <li>I say unto you, what he hath done famously, he did</li>
  <li>it to that end: though soft-conscienced men can be</li>
  <li>content to say it was for his country he did it to</li>
  <li class="number">please his mother and to be partly proud; which he</li>
  <li>is, even till the altitude of his virtue.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Citizen</li>
  <li>What he cannot help in his nature, you account a</li>
  <li>vice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Citizen</li>
  <li>If I must not, I need not be barren of accusations;</li>
  <li class="number">he hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Shouts within</li>
  <li>What shouts are these? The other side o' the city</li>
  <li>is risen: why stay we prating here? to the Capitol!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">All</li>
  <li>Come, come.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Citizen</li>
  <li>Soft! who comes here?</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter MENENIUS AGRIPPA</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Citizen</li>
  <li class="number">Worthy Menenius Agrippa; one that hath always loved</li>
  <li>the people.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Citizen</li>
  <li>He's one honest enough: would all the rest were so!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>What work's, my countrymen, in hand? where go you</li>
  <li>With bats and clubs? The matter? speak, I pray you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Citizen</li>
  <li class="number">Our business is not unknown to the senate; they have</li>
  <li>had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do,</li>
  <li>which now we'll show 'em in deeds. They say poor</li>
  <li>suitors have strong breaths: they shall know we</li>
  <li>have strong arms too.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li class="number">Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbours,</li>
  <li>Will you undo yourselves?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Citizen</li>
  <li>We cannot, sir, we are undone already.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>I tell you, friends, most charitable care</li>
  <li>Have the patricians of you. For your wants,</li>
  <li class="number">Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well</li>
  <li>Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them</li>
  <li>Against the Roman state, whose course will on</li>
  <li>The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs</li>
  <li>Of more strong link asunder than can ever</li>
  <li class="number">Appear in your impediment. For the dearth,</li>
  <li>The gods, not the patricians, make it, and</li>
  <li>Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,</li>
  <li>You are transported by calamity</li>
  <li>Thither where more attends you, and you slander</li>
  <li class="number">The helms o' the state, who care for you like fathers,</li>
  <li>When you curse them as enemies.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Citizen</li>
  <li>Care for us! True, indeed! They ne'er cared for us</li>
  <li>yet: suffer us to famish, and their store-houses</li>
  <li>crammed with grain; make edicts for usury, to</li>
  <li class="number">support usurers; repeal daily any wholesome act</li>
  <li>established against the rich, and provide more</li>
  <li>piercing statutes daily, to chain up and restrain</li>
  <li>the poor. If the wars eat us not up, they will; and</li>
  <li>there's all the love they bear us.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li class="number">Either you must</li>
  <li>Confess yourselves wondrous malicious,</li>
  <li>Or be accused of folly. I shall tell you</li>
  <li>A pretty tale: it may be you have heard it;</li>
  <li>But, since it serves my purpose, I will venture</li>
  <li class="number">To stale 't a little more.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Citizen</li>
  <li>Well, I'll hear it, sir: yet you must not think to</li>
  <li>fob off our disgrace with a tale: but, an 't please</li>
  <li>you, deliver.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>There was a time when all the body's members</li>
  <li class="number">Rebell'd against the belly, thus accused it:</li>
  <li>That only like a gulf it did remain</li>
  <li>I' the midst o' the body, idle and unactive,</li>
  <li>Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing</li>
  <li>Like labour with the rest, where the other instruments</li>
  <li class="number">Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,</li>
  <li>And, mutually participate, did minister</li>
  <li>Unto the appetite and affection common</li>
  <li>Of the whole body. The belly answer'd — </li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Citizen</li>
  <li>Well, sir, what answer made the belly?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li class="number">Sir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile,</li>
  <li>Which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus — </li>
  <li>For, look you, I may make the belly smile</li>
  <li>As well as speak — it tauntingly replied</li>
  <li>To the discontented members, the mutinous parts</li>
  <li class="number">That envied his receipt; even so most fitly</li>
  <li>As you malign our senators for that</li>
  <li>They are not such as you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Citizen</li>
  <li>Your belly's answer? What!</li>
  <li>The kingly-crowned head, the vigilant eye,</li>
  <li class="number">The counsellor heart, the arm our soldier,</li>
  <li>Our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter.</li>
  <li>With other muniments and petty helps</li>
  <li>In this our fabric, if that they — </li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>What then?</li>
  <li class="number">'Fore me, this fellow speaks! What then? what then?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Citizen</li>
  <li>Should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd,</li>
  <li>Who is the sink o' the body —  </li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>Well, what then?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Citizen</li>
  <li>The former agents, if they did complain,</li>
  <li class="number">What could the belly answer?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>I will tell you</li>
  <li>If you'll bestow a small — of what you have little — </li>
  <li>Patience awhile, you'll hear the belly's answer.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Citizen</li>
  <li>Ye're long about it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li class="number">Note me this, good friend;</li>
  <li>Your most grave belly was deliberate,</li>
  <li>Not rash like his accusers, and thus answer'd:</li>
  <li>'True is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he,</li>
  <li>'That I receive the general food at first,</li>
  <li class="number">Which you do live upon; and fit it is,</li>
  <li>Because I am the store-house and the shop</li>
  <li>Of the whole body: but, if you do remember,</li>
  <li>I send it through the rivers of your blood,</li>
  <li>Even to the court, the heart, to the seat o' the brain;</li>
  <li class="number">And, through the cranks and offices of man,</li>
  <li>The strongest nerves and small inferior veins</li>
  <li>From me receive that natural competency</li>
  <li>Whereby they live: and though that all at once,</li>
  <li>You, my good friends,' — this says the belly, mark me —  </li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Citizen</li>
  <li class="number">Ay, sir; well, well.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>'Though all at once cannot</li>
  <li>See what I do deliver out to each,</li>
  <li>Yet I can make my audit up, that all</li>
  <li>From me do back receive the flour of all,</li>
  <li class="number">And leave me but the bran.' What say you to't?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Citizen</li>
  <li>It was an answer: how apply you this?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>The senators of Rome are this good belly,</li>
  <li>And you the mutinous members; for examine</li>
  <li>Their counsels and their cares, digest things rightly</li>
  <li class="number">Touching the weal o' the common, you shall find</li>
  <li>No public benefit which you receive</li>
  <li>But it proceeds or comes from them to you</li>
  <li>And no way from yourselves. What do you think,</li>
  <li>You, the great toe of this assembly?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Citizen</li>
  <li class="number">I the great toe! why the great toe?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>For that, being one o' the lowest, basest, poorest,</li>
  <li>Of this most wise rebellion, thou go'st foremost:</li>
  <li>Thou rascal, that art worst in blood to run,</li>
  <li>Lead'st first to win some vantage.</li>
  <li class="number">But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs:</li>
  <li>Rome and her rats are at the point of battle;</li>
  <li>The one side must have bale.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Enter CAIUS MARCIUS</li>
  <li>Hail, noble Marcius!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MARCIUS</li>
  <li>Thanks. What's the matter, you dissentious rogues,</li>
  <li class="number">That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,</li>
  <li>Make yourselves scabs?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Citizen</li>
  <li>We have ever your good word.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MARCIUS</li>
  <li>He that will give good words to thee will flatter</li>
  <li>Beneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs,</li>
  <li class="number">That like nor peace nor war? the one affrights you,</li>
  <li>The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,</li>
  <li>Where he should find you lions, finds you hares;</li>
  <li>Where foxes, geese: you are no surer, no,</li>
  <li>Than is the coal of fire upon the ice,</li>
  <li class="number">Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is</li>
  <li>To make him worthy whose offence subdues him</li>
  <li>And curse that justice did it.</li>
  <li>Who deserves greatness</li>
  <li>Deserves your hate; and your affections are</li>
  <li class="number">A sick man's appetite, who desires most that</li>
  <li>Which would increase his evil. He that depends</li>
  <li>Upon your favours swims with fins of lead</li>
  <li>And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust Ye?</li>
  <li>With every minute you do change a mind,</li>
  <li class="number">And call him noble that was now your hate,</li>
  <li>Him vile that was your garland. What's the matter,</li>
  <li>That in these several places of the city</li>
  <li>You cry against the noble senate, who,</li>
  <li>Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else</li>
  <li class="number">Would feed on one another? What's their seeking?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>For corn at their own rates; whereof, they say,</li>
  <li>The city is well stored.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MARCIUS</li>
  <li>Hang 'em! They say!</li>
  <li>They'll sit by the fire, and presume to know</li>
  <li class="number">What's done i' the Capitol; who's like to rise,</li>
  <li>Who thrives and who declines; side factions</li>
  <li>and give out</li>
  <li>Conjectural marriages; making parties strong</li>
  <li>And feebling such as stand not in their liking</li>
  <li class="number">Below their cobbled shoes. They say there's</li>
  <li>grain enough!</li>
  <li>Would the nobility lay aside their ruth,</li>
  <li>And let me use my sword, I'll make a quarry</li>
  <li>With thousands of these quarter'd slaves, as high</li>
  <li class="number">As I could pick my lance.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded;</li>
  <li>For though abundantly they lack discretion,</li>
  <li>Yet are they passing cowardly. But, I beseech you,</li>
  <li>What says the other troop?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MARCIUS</li>
  <li class="number">They are dissolved: hang 'em!</li>
  <li>They said they were an-hungry; sigh'd forth proverbs,</li>
  <li>That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,</li>
  <li>That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not</li>
  <li>Corn for the rich men only: with these shreds</li>
  <li class="number">They vented their complainings; which being answer'd,</li>
  <li>And a petition granted them, a strange one — </li>
  <li>To break the heart of generosity,</li>
  <li>And make bold power look pale — they threw their caps</li>
  <li>As they would hang them on the horns o' the moon,</li>
  <li class="number">Shouting their emulation.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>What is granted them?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MARCIUS</li>
  <li>Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms,</li>
  <li>Of their own choice: one's Junius Brutus,</li>
  <li>Sicinius Velutus, and I know not — 'Sdeath!</li>
  <li class="number">The rabble should have first unroof'd the city,</li>
  <li>Ere so prevail'd with me: it will in time</li>
  <li>Win upon power and throw forth greater themes</li>
  <li>For insurrection's arguing.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>This is strange.</li>

  <li>war I sent him; from whence he returned, his brows</li>

<h3>SCENE I.  Rome. A public place.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter MENENIUS with the two Tribunes of the people,
SICINIUS and BRUTUS.</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>The augurer tells me we shall have news to-night.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>
  <li>Good or bad?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>Not according to the prayer of the people, for they</li>
  <li>love not Marcius.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SICINIUS</li>
  <li class="number">Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>Pray you, who does the wolf love?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SICINIUS</li>
  <li>The lamb.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>Ay, to devour him; as the hungry plebeians would the</li>
  <li>noble Marcius.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>
  <li class="number">He's a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>He's a bear indeed, that lives like a lamb. You two</li>
  <li>are old men: tell me one thing that I shall ask you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Both</li>
  <li>Well, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>In what enormity is Marcius poor in, that you two</li>
  <li class="number">have not in abundance?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>
  <li>He's poor in no one fault, but stored with all.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SICINIUS</li>
  <li>Especially in pride.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>
  <li>And topping all others in boasting.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>This is strange now: do you two know how you are</li>
  <li class="number">censured here in the city, I mean of us o' the</li>
  <li>right-hand file? do you?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Both</li>
  <li>Why, how are we censured?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>Because you talk of pride now —  will you not be angry?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Both</li>
  <li>Well, well, sir, well.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li class="number">Why, 'tis no great matter; for a very little thief of</li>
  <li>occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience:</li>
  <li>give your dispositions the reins, and be angry at</li>
  <li>your pleasures; at the least if you take it as a</li>
  <li>pleasure to you in being so. You blame Marcius for</li>
  <li class="number">being proud?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>
  <li>We do it not alone, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>I know you can do very little alone; for your helps</li>
  <li>are many, or else your actions would grow wondrous</li>
  <li>single: your abilities are too infant-like for</li>
  <li class="number">doing much alone. You talk of pride: O that you</li>
  <li>could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks,</li>
  <li>and make but an interior survey of your good selves!</li>
  <li>O that you could!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>
  <li>What then, sir?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li class="number">Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting,</li>
  <li>proud, violent, testy magistrates, alias fools, as</li>
  <li>any in Rome.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SICINIUS</li>
  <li>Menenius, you are known well enough too.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that</li>
  <li class="number">loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying</li>
  <li>Tiber in't; said to be something imperfect in</li>
  <li>favouring the first complaint; hasty and tinder-like</li>
  <li>upon too trivial motion; one that converses more</li>
  <li>with the buttock of the night than with the forehead</li>
  <li class="number">of the morning: what I think I utter, and spend my</li>
  <li>malice in my breath. Meeting two such wealsmen as</li>
  <li>you are — I cannot call you Lycurguses — if the drink</li>
  <li>you give me touch my palate adversely, I make a</li>
  <li>crooked face at it. I can't say your worships have</li>
  <li class="number">delivered the matter well, when I find the ass in</li>
  <li>compound with the major part of your syllables: and</li>
  <li>though I must be content to bear with those that say</li>
  <li>you are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly that</li>
  <li>tell you you have good faces. If you see this in</li>
  <li class="number">the map of my microcosm, follows it that I am known</li>
  <li>well enough too? what barm can your bisson</li>
  <li>conspectuities glean out of this character, if I be</li>
  <li>known well enough too?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>
  <li>Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li class="number">You know neither me, yourselves nor any thing. You</li>
  <li>are ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs: you</li>
  <li>wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a</li>
  <li>cause between an orange wife and a fosset-seller;</li>
  <li>and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a</li>
  <li class="number">second day of audience. When you are hearing a</li>
  <li>matter between party and party, if you chance to be</li>
  <li>pinched with the colic, you make faces like</li>
  <li>mummers; set up the bloody flag against all</li>
  <li>patience; and, in roaring for a chamber-pot,</li>
  <li class="number">dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled</li>
  <li>by your hearing: all the peace you make in their</li>
  <li>cause is, calling both the parties knaves. You are</li>
  <li>a pair of strange ones.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>
  <li>Come, come, you are well understood to be a</li>
  <li class="number">perfecter giber for the table than a necessary</li>
  <li>bencher in the Capitol.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>Our very priests must become mockers, if they shall</li>
  <li>encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When</li>
  <li>you speak best unto the purpose, it is not worth the</li>
  <li class="number">wagging of your beards; and your beards deserve not</li>
  <li>so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher's</li>
  <li>cushion, or to be entombed in an ass's pack-</li>
  <li>saddle. Yet you must be saying, Marcius is proud;</li>
  <li>who in a cheap estimation, is worth predecessors</li>
  <li class="number">since Deucalion, though peradventure some of the</li>
  <li>best of 'em were hereditary hangmen. God-den to</li>
  <li>your worships: more of your conversation would</li>
  <li>infect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly</li>
  <li>plebeians: I will be bold to take my leave of you.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">BRUTUS and SICINIUS go aside</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Enter VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, and VALERIA</li>
  <li class="number">How now, my as fair as noble ladies —  and the moon,</li>
  <li>were she earthly, no nobler —  whither do you follow</li>
  <li>your eyes so fast?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">VOLUMNIA</li>
  <li>Honourable Menenius, my boy Marcius approaches; for</li>
  <li>the love of Juno, let's go.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li class="number">Ha! Marcius coming home!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">VOLUMNIA</li>
  <li>Ay, worthy Menenius; and with most prosperous</li>
  <li>approbation.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>Take my cap, Jupiter, and I thank thee. Hoo!</li>
  <li>Marcius coming home!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">VOLUMNIA</li>
  <li class="speaker">VIRGILIA</li>
  <li class="number">Nay,'tis true.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">VOLUMNIA</li>
  <li>Look, here's a letter from him: the state hath</li>
  <li>another, his wife another; and, I think, there's one</li>
  <li>at home for you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>I will make my very house reel tonight: a letter for</li>
  <li class="number">me!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">VIRGILIA</li>
  <li>Yes, certain, there's a letter for you; I saw't.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>A letter for me! it gives me an estate of seven</li>
  <li>years' health; in which time I will make a lip at</li>
  <li>the physician: the most sovereign prescription in</li>
  <li class="number">Galen is but empiricutic, and, to this preservative,</li>
  <li>of no better report than a horse-drench. Is he</li>
  <li>not wounded? he was wont to come home wounded.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">VIRGILIA</li>
  <li>O, no, no, no.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">VOLUMNIA</li>
  <li>O, he is wounded; I thank the gods for't.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li class="number">So do I too, if it be not too much: brings a'</li>
  <li>victory in his pocket? the wounds become him.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">VOLUMNIA</li>
  <li>On's brows: Menenius, he comes the third time home</li>
  <li>with the oaken garland.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">VOLUMNIA</li>
  <li class="number">Titus Lartius writes, they fought together, but</li>
  <li>Aufidius got off.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>And 'twas time for him too, I'll warrant him that:</li>
  <li>an he had stayed by him, I would not have been so</li>
  <li>fidiused for all the chests in Corioli, and the gold</li>
  <li class="number">that's in them. Is the senate possessed of this?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">VOLUMNIA</li>
  <li>Good ladies, let's go. Yes, yes, yes; the senate</li>
  <li>has letters from the general, wherein he gives my</li>
  <li>son the whole name of the war: he hath in this</li>
  <li>action outdone his former deeds doubly</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">VALERIA</li>
  <li class="number">In troth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>Wondrous! ay, I warrant you, and not without his</li>
  <li>true purchasing.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">VIRGILIA</li>
  <li>The gods grant them true!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">VOLUMNIA</li>
  <li>True! pow, wow.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li class="number">True! I'll be sworn they are true.</li>
  <li>Where is he wounded?</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">To the Tribunes</li>
  <li>God save your good worships! Marcius is coming</li>
  <li>home: he has more cause to be proud. Where is he wounded?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">VOLUMNIA</li>
  <li>I' the shoulder and i' the left arm there will be</li>
  <li class="number">large cicatrices to show the people, when he shall</li>
  <li>stand for his place. He received in the repulse of</li>
  <li>Tarquin seven hurts i' the body.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>One i' the neck, and two i' the thigh —  there's</li>
  <li>nine that I know.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">VOLUMNIA</li>
  <li class="number">He had, before this last expedition, twenty-five</li>
  <li>wounds upon him.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>Now it's twenty-seven: every gash was an enemy's grave.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">A shout and flourish</li>
  <li>Hark! the trumpets.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">VOLUMNIA</li>
  <li>These are the ushers of Marcius::before him he</li>

  <li>Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die.</li>

  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>
  <li>All tongues speak of him, and the bleared sights</li>
  <li>Are spectacled to see him: your prattling nurse</li>
  <li>Into a rapture lets her baby cry</li>
  <li class="number">While she chats him: the kitchen malkin pins</li>
  <li>Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,</li>

  <li>Are smother'd up, leads fill'd, and ridges horsed</li>
  <li>With variable complexions, all agreeing</li>
  <li class="number">In earnestness to see him: seld-shown flamens</li>

<ol class="speech">

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SICINIUS</li>
  <li>He cannot temperately transport his honours</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>
  <li>In that there's comfort.</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>
  <li>I heard him swear,</li>
  <li>Were he to stand for consul, never would he</li>

  <li>Nor showing, as the manner is, his wounds</li>

  <li class="speaker">SICINIUS</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>
  <li>So it must fall out</li>
  <li class="number">To him or our authorities. For an end,</li>
  <li>We must suggest the people in what hatred</li>
  <li>He still hath held them; that to's power he would</li>
  <li>Have made them mules, silenced their pleaders and</li>
  <li>Dispropertied their freedoms, holding them,</li>
  <li class="number">In human action and capacity,</li>
  <li>Of no more soul nor fitness for the world</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SICINIUS</li>

  <li>As to set dogs on sheep — will be his fire</li>

<h3>SCENE  II.  The same. The Capitol.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter two Officers, to lay cushions</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Officer</li>
  <li>Come, come, they are almost here. How many stand</li>
  <li>for consulships?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Officer</li>
  <li>Three, they say: but 'tis thought of every one</li>
  <li>Coriolanus will carry it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Officer</li>
  <li class="number">That's a brave fellow; but he's vengeance proud, and</li>
  <li>loves not the common people.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Officer</li>
  <li>Faith, there had been many great men that have</li>
  <li>flattered the people, who ne'er loved them; and there</li>
  <li>be many that they have loved, they know not</li>
  <li class="number">wherefore: so that, if they love they know not why,</li>
  <li>they hate upon no better a ground: therefore, for</li>
  <li>Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate</li>
  <li>him manifests the true knowledge he has in their</li>
  <li>disposition; and out of his noble carelessness lets</li>
  <li class="number">them plainly see't.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Officer</li>
  <li>If he did not care whether he had their love or no,</li>
  <li>he waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neither</li>
  <li>good nor harm: but he seeks their hate with greater</li>
  <li>devotion than can render it him; and leaves</li>
  <li class="number">nothing undone that may fully discover him their</li>
  <li>opposite. Now, to seem to affect the malice and</li>
  <li>displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he</li>
  <li>dislikes, to flatter them for their love.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Officer</li>
  <li>He hath deserved worthily of his country: and his</li>
  <li class="number">ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who,</li>
  <li>having been supple and courteous to the people,</li>
  <li>bonneted, without any further deed to have them at</li>
  <li>an into their estimation and report: but he hath so</li>
  <li>planted his honours in their eyes, and his actions</li>
  <li class="number">in their hearts, that for their tongues to be</li>
  <li>silent, and not confess so much, were a kind of</li>
  <li>ingrateful injury; to report otherwise, were a</li>
  <li>malice, that, giving itself the lie, would pluck</li>
  <li>reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Officer</li>
  <li class="number">No more of him; he is a worthy man: make way, they</li>
  <li>are coming.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">A sennet. Enter, with actors before them, COMINIUS
the consul, MENENIUS, CORIOLANUS, Senators,
SICINIUS and BRUTUS. The Senators take their
places; the Tribunes take their Places by
themselves. CORIOLANUS stands</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>Having determined of the Volsces and</li>
  <li>To send for Titus Lartius, it remains,</li>
  <li>As the main point of this our after-meeting,</li>
  <li class="number">To gratify his noble service that</li>
  <li>Hath thus stood for his country: therefore,</li>
  <li>please you,</li>
  <li>Most reverend and grave elders, to desire</li>
  <li>The present consul, and last general</li>
  <li class="number">In our well-found successes, to report</li>
  <li>A little of that worthy work perform'd</li>
  <li>By Caius Marcius Coriolanus, whom</li>
  <li>We met here both to thank and to remember</li>
  <li>With honours like himself.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Senator</li>
  <li class="number">Speak, good Cominius:</li>
  <li>Leave nothing out for length, and make us think</li>
  <li>Rather our state's defective for requital</li>
  <li>Than we to stretch it out.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">To the Tribunes</li>
  <li>Masters o' the people,</li>
  <li class="number">We do request your kindest ears, and after,</li>
  <li>Your loving motion toward the common body,</li>
  <li>To yield what passes here.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SICINIUS</li>
  <li>We are convented</li>

  <li>The theme of our assembly.</li>

  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>

  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>That's off, that's off;</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>

  <li class="number">Nay, keep your place.</li>

  <li>Sit, Coriolanus; never shame to hear</li>
  <li>What you have nobly done.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CORIOLANUS</li>
  <li>Your horror's pardon:</li>

  <li>Sir, I hope</li>
  <li>My words disbench'd you not.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CORIOLANUS</li>
  <li>No, sir: yet oft,</li>
  <li>When blows have made me stay, I fled from words.</li>
  <li class="number">You soothed not, therefore hurt not: but</li>
  <li>your people,</li>
  <li>I love them as they weigh.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>Pray now, sit down.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CORIOLANUS</li>
  <li>I had rather have one scratch my head i' the sun</li>
  <li class="number">When the alarum were struck than idly sit</li>
  <li>To hear my nothings monster'd.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>Masters of the people,</li>
  <li>Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter — </li>
  <li>That's thousand to one good one — when you now see</li>
  <li class="number">He had rather venture all his limbs for honour</li>
  <li>Than one on's ears to hear it? Proceed, Cominius.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">COMINIUS</li>
  <li>I shall lack voice: the deeds of Coriolanus</li>
  <li>Should not be utter'd feebly. It is held</li>
  <li>That valour is the chiefest virtue, and</li>
  <li class="number">Most dignifies the haver: if it be,</li>
  <li>The man I speak of cannot in the world</li>
  <li>Be singly counterpoised. At sixteen years,</li>
  <li>When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought</li>
  <li>Beyond the mark of others: our then dictator,</li>
  <li class="number">Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight,</li>
  <li>When with his Amazonian chin he drove</li>
  <li>The bristled lips before him: be bestrid</li>
  <li>An o'er-press'd Roman and i' the consul's view</li>
  <li>Slew three opposers: Tarquin's self he met,</li>
  <li class="number">And struck him on his knee: in that day's feats,</li>
  <li>When he might act the woman in the scene,</li>
  <li>He proved best man i' the field, and for his meed</li>
  <li>Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age</li>
  <li>Man-enter'd thus, he waxed like a sea,</li>
  <li class="number">And in the brunt of seventeen battles since</li>
  <li>He lurch'd all swords of the garland. For this last,</li>
  <li>Before and in Corioli, let me say,</li>
  <li>I cannot speak him home: he stopp'd the fliers;</li>
  <li>And by his rare example made the coward</li>
  <li class="number">Turn terror into sport: as weeds before</li>
  <li>A vessel under sail, so men obey'd</li>
  <li>And fell below his stem: his sword, death's stamp,</li>
  <li>Where it did mark, it took; from face to foot</li>
  <li>He was a thing of blood, whose every motion</li>
  <li class="number">Was timed with dying cries: alone he enter'd</li>
  <li>The mortal gate of the city, which he painted</li>
  <li>With shunless destiny; aidless came off,</li>
  <li>And with a sudden reinforcement struck</li>
  <li>Corioli like a planet: now all's his:</li>
  <li class="number">When, by and by, the din of war gan pierce</li>
  <li>His ready sense; then straight his doubled spirit</li>
  <li>Re-quicken'd what in flesh was fatigate,</li>
  <li>And to the battle came he; where he did</li>
  <li>Run reeking o'er the lives of men, as if</li>
  <li class="number">'Twere a perpetual spoil: and till we call'd</li>
  <li>Both field and city ours, he never stood</li>
  <li>To ease his breast with panting.</li>

  <li>the insinuating nod and be off to them most</li>
  <li>counterfeitly; that is, sir, I will counterfeit the</li>
  <li>bewitchment of some popular man and give it</li>

  <li class="speaker">Third Citizen</li>
  <li>Certainly</li>

  <li class="speaker">First Citizen</li>
  <li>No,'tis his kind of speech: he did not mock us.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Citizen</li>
  <li>Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says</li>
  <li>He used us scornfully: he should have show'd us</li>
  <li>His marks of merit, wounds received for's country.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SICINIUS</li>
  <li class="number">Why, so he did, I am sure.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Citizens</li>
  <li>No, no; no man saw 'em.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Third Citizen</li>
  <li>He said he had wounds, which he could show</li>
  <li>in private;</li>
  <li>And with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,</li>
  <li class="number">'I would be consul,' says he: 'aged custom,</li>
  <li>But by your voices, will not so permit me;</li>
  <li>Your voices therefore.' When we granted that,</li>
  <li>Here was 'I thank you for your voices: thank you:</li>
  <li>Your most sweet voices: now you have left</li>
  <li class="number">your voices,</li>
  <li>I have no further with you.' Was not this mockery?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SICINIUS</li>
  <li>Why either were you ignorant to see't,</li>
  <li>Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness</li>
  <li>To yield your voices?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>
  <li class="number">Could you not have told him</li>
  <li>As you were lesson'd, when he had no power,</li>
  <li>But was a petty servant to the state,</li>
  <li>He was your enemy, ever spake against</li>
  <li>Your liberties and the charters that you bear</li>
  <li class="number">I' the body of the weal; and now, arriving</li>
  <li>A place of potency and sway o' the state,</li>
  <li>If he should still malignantly remain</li>
  <li>Fast foe to the plebeii, your voices might</li>
  <li>Be curses to yourselves? You should have said</li>
  <li class="number">That as his worthy deeds did claim no less</li>
  <li>Than what he stood for, so his gracious nature</li>
  <li>Would think upon you for your voices and</li>
  <li>Translate his malice towards you into love,</li>
  <li>Standing your friendly lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SICINIUS</li>
  <li class="number">Thus to have said,</li>
  <li>As you were fore-advised, had touch'd his spirit</li>
  <li>And tried his inclination; from him pluck'd</li>
  <li>Either his gracious promise, which you might,</li>
  <li>As cause had call'd you up, have held him to</li>
  <li class="number">Or else it would have gall'd his surly nature,</li>
  <li>Which easily endures not article</li>
  <li>Tying him to aught; so putting him to rage,</li>
  <li>You should have ta'en the advantage of his choler</li>
  <li>And pass'd him unelected.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>
  <li class="number">Did you perceive</li>
  <li>He did solicit you in free contempt</li>
  <li>When he did need your loves, and do you think</li>
  <li>That his contempt shall not be bruising to you,</li>
  <li>When he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodies</li>
  <li class="number">No heart among you? or had you tongues to cry</li>
  <li>Against the rectorship of judgment?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SICINIUS</li>
  <li>Have you</li>
  <li>Ere now denied the asker? and now again</li>
  <li>Of him that did not ask, but mock, bestow</li>
  <li class="number">Your sued-for tongues?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Third Citizen</li>
  <li>He's not confirm'd; we may deny him yet.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Citizen</li>
  <li>And will deny him:</li>
  <li>I'll have five hundred voices of that sound.</li>

  <li class="speaker">First Citizen</li>
  <li>I twice five hundred and their friends to piece 'em.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>
  <li class="number">Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends,</li>
  <li>They have chose a consul that will from them take</li>
  <li>Their liberties; make them of no more voice</li>

  <li>As therefore kept to do so.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SICINIUS</li>
  <li class="number">Let them assemble,</li>
  <li>And on a safer judgment all revoke</li>

  <li>With what contempt he wore the humble weed,</li>
  <li class="number">How in his suit he scorn'd you; but your loves,</li>
  <li>Thinking upon his services, took from you</li>
  <li>The apprehension of his present portance,</li>
  <li>Which most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion</li>
  <li>After the inveterate hate he bears you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>
  <li class="number">Lay</li>
  <li>A fault on us, your tribunes; that we laboured,</li>
  <li>No impediment between, but that you must</li>
  <li>Cast your election on him.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SICINIUS</li>
  <li>Say, you chose him</li>
  <li class="number">More after our commandment than as guided</li>
  <li>By your own true affections, and that your minds,</li>
  <li>Preoccupied with what you rather must do</li>
  <li>Than what you should, made you against the grain</li>
  <li>To voice him consul: lay the fault on us.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>
  <li class="number">Ay, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you.</li>
  <li>How youngly he began to serve his country,</li>
  <li>How long continued, and what stock he springs of,</li>
  <li>The noble house o' the Marcians, from whence came</li>
  <li>That Ancus Marcius, Numa's daughter's son,</li>
  <li class="number">Who, after great Hostilius, here was king;</li>
  <li>Of the same house Publius and Quintus were,</li>
  <li>That our beat water brought by conduits hither;</li>
  <li>And  Censorinus,  nobly named so,</li>
  <li>Twice being  by the people chosen  censor,</li>
  <li class="number">Was his great ancestor.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SICINIUS</li>
  <li>One thus descended,</li>
  <li>That hath beside well in his person wrought</li>
  <li>To be set high in place, we did commend</li>
  <li>To your remembrances: but you have found,</li>
  <li class="number">Scaling his present bearing with his past,</li>
  <li>That he's your fixed enemy, and revoke</li>
  <li>Your sudden approbation.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>
  <li>Say, you ne'er had done't — </li>

  <li class="number">And presently, when you have drawn your number,</li>
  <li>Repair to the Capitol.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CORIOLANUS</li>

  <li class="speaker">CORIOLANUS</li>
  <li>'Shall'!</li>
  <li class="number">O good but most unwise patricians! why,</li>
  <li>You grave but reckless senators, have you thus</li>
  <li>Given Hydra here to choose an officer,</li>
  <li>That with his peremptory 'shall,' being but</li>
  <li>The horn and noise o' the monster's, wants not spirit</li>
  <li class="number">To say he'll turn your current in a ditch,</li>
  <li>And make your channel his? If he have power</li>
  <li>Then vail your ignorance; if none, awake</li>
  <li>Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd,</li>
  <li>Be not as common fools; if you are not,</li>
  <li class="number">Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,</li>
  <li>If they be senators: and they are no less,</li>
  <li>When, both your voices blended, the great'st taste</li>
  <li>Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate,</li>
  <li>And such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,'</li>
  <li class="number">His popular 'shall' against a graver bench</li>
  <li>Than ever frown in Greece. By Jove himself!</li>
  <li>It makes the consuls base: and my soul aches</li>
  <li>To know, when two authorities are up,</li>
  <li>Neither supreme, how soon confusion</li>

  <li>Whoever gave that counsel, to give forth</li>
  <li>The corn o' the storehouse gratis, as 'twas used</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>Well, well, no more of that.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CORIOLANUS</li>
  <li>Though there the people had more absolute power,</li>
  <li>I say, they nourish'd disobedience, fed</li>
  <li>The ruin of the state.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BRUTUS</li>
  <li class="number">Why, shall the people give</li>
  <li>One that speaks thus their voice?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CORIOLANUS</li>
  <li>I'll give my reasons,</li>
  <li>More worthier than their voices. They know the corn</li>
  <li>Was not our recompense, resting well assured</li>
  <li class="number">That ne'er did service for't: being press'd to the war,</li>
  <li>Even when the navel of the state was touch'd,</li>
  <li>They would not thread the gates. This kind of service</li>
  <li>Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i' the war</li>
  <li>Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'd</li>
  <li class="number">Most valour, spoke not for them: the accusation</li>
  <li>Which they have often made against the senate,</li>
  <li>All cause unborn, could never be the motive</li>
  <li>Of our so frank donation. Well, what then?</li>
  <li>How shall this bisson multitude digest</li>
  <li class="number">The senate's courtesy? Let deeds express</li>
  <li>What's like to be their words: 'we did request it;</li>
  <li>We are the greater poll, and in true fear</li>
  <li>They gave us our demands.' Thus we debase</li>
  <li>The nature of our seats and make the rabble</li>
  <li class="number">Call our cares fears; which will in time</li>
  <li>Break ope the locks o' the senate and bring in</li>
  <li>The crows to peck the eagles.</li>

  <li>Insult without all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom,</li>
  <li class="number">Cannot conclude but by the yea and no</li>
  <li>Of general ignorance —  it must omit</li>
  <li>Real necessities, and give way the while</li>
  <li>To unstable slightness: purpose so barr'd,</li>
  <li>it follows,</li>
  <li class="number">Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore, beseech you —  </li>
  <li>You that will be less fearful than discreet,</li>
  <li>That love the fundamental part of state</li>
  <li>More than you doubt the change on't, that prefer</li>
  <li>A noble life before a long, and wish</li>
  <li class="number">To jump a body with a dangerous physic</li>
  <li>That's sure of death without it, at once pluck out</li>
  <li>The multitudinous tongue; let them not lick</li>
  <li>The sweet which is their poison: your dishonour</li>
  <li>Mangles true judgment and bereaves the state</li>

  <li class="speaker">CORIOLANUS</li>
  <li>Why force you this?</li>

  <li class="number">But with such words that are but rooted in</li>
  <li>Your tongue, though but bastards and syllables</li>
  <li>Of no allowance to your bosom's truth.</li>
  <li>Now, this no more dishonours you at all</li>
  <li>Than to take in a town with gentle words,</li>
  <li class="number">Which else would put you to your fortune and</li>
  <li>The hazard of much blood.</li>
  <li>I would dissemble with my nature where</li>
  <li>My fortunes and my friends at stake required</li>
  <li>I should do so in honour: I am in this,</li>
  <li class="number">Your wife, your son, these senators, the nobles;</li>

  <li class="speaker">VOLUMNIA</li>
  <li>I prithee now, my son,</li>
  <li class="number">Go to them, with this bonnet in thy hand;</li>

  <li>More learned than the ears — waving thy head,</li>
  <li class="number">Which often, thus, correcting thy stout heart,</li>
  <li>Now humble as the ripest mulberry</li>
  <li>That will not hold the handling: or say to them,</li>
  <li>Thou art their soldier, and being bred in broils</li>
  <li>Hast not the soft way which, thou dost confess,</li>
  <li class="number">Were fit for thee to use as they to claim,</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>

  <li>Tent in my cheeks, and schoolboys' tears take up</li>

  <li class="speaker">Volsce</li>
  <li>You had more beard when I last saw you; but your</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Roman</li>
  <li>The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing</li>

  <li>Coriolanus, that they are in a ripe aptness to take</li>
  <li>all power from the people and to pluck from them</li>
  <li>their tribunes for ever. This lies glowing, I can</li>

  <li class="speaker">AUFIDIUS</li>
  <li>What is thy name?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CORIOLANUS</li>
  <li>A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears,</li>
  <li>And harsh in sound to thine.</li>

  <li class="speaker">AUFIDIUS</li>
  <li>Say, what's thy name?</li>
  <li class="number">Thou hast a grim appearance, and thy face</li>

  <li>Thou show'st a noble vessel: what's thy name?</li>

  <li class="speaker">CORIOLANUS</li>

  <li class="speaker">AUFIDIUS</li>
  <li class="number">I know thee not: thy name?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CORIOLANUS</li>
  <li>My name is Caius Marcius, who hath done</li>
  <li>To thee particularly and to all the Volsces</li>
  <li>Great hurt and mischief; thereto witness may</li>
  <li>My surname, Coriolanus: the painful service,</li>
  <li class="number">The extreme dangers and the drops of blood</li>
  <li>Shed for my thankless country are requited</li>
  <li>But with that surname; a good memory,</li>
  <li>And witness of the malice and displeasure</li>
  <li>Which thou shouldst bear me: only that name remains;</li>
  <li class="number">The cruelty and envy of the people,</li>
  <li>Permitted by our dastard nobles, who</li>
  <li>Have all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest;</li>
  <li>And suffer'd me by the voice of slaves to be</li>
  <li>Whoop'd out of Rome. Now this extremity</li>
  <li class="number">Hath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope — </li>
  <li>Mistake me not — to save my life, for if</li>
  <li>I had fear'd death, of all the men i' the world</li>
  <li>I would have 'voided thee, but in mere spite,</li>
  <li>To be full quit of those my banishers,</li>
  <li class="number">Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast</li>
  <li>A heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge</li>
  <li>Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims</li>
  <li>Of shame seen through thy country, speed</li>
  <li>thee straight,</li>
  <li class="number">And make my misery serve thy turn: so use it</li>
  <li>That my revengeful services may prove</li>
  <li>As benefits to thee, for I will fight</li>
  <li>Against my canker'd country with the spleen</li>
  <li>Of all the under fiends. But if so be</li>
  <li class="number">Thou darest not this and that to prove more fortunes</li>
  <li>Thou'rt tired, then, in a word, I also am</li>
  <li>Longer to live most weary, and present</li>
  <li>My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice;</li>
  <li>Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,</li>
  <li class="number">Since I have ever follow'd thee with hate,</li>
  <li>Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast,</li>
  <li>And cannot live but to thy shame, unless</li>
  <li>It be to do thee service.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">AUFIDIUS</li>
  <li>O Marcius, Marcius!</li>
  <li class="number">Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart</li>
  <li>A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter</li>
  <li>Should from yond cloud speak divine things,</li>
  <li>And say 'Tis true,' I'ld not believe them more</li>
  <li>Than thee, all noble Marcius. Let me twine</li>
  <li class="number">Mine arms about that body, where against</li>
  <li>My grained ash an hundred times hath broke</li>
  <li>And scarr'd the moon with splinters: here I clip</li>
  <li>The anvil of my sword, and do contest</li>
  <li>As hotly and as nobly with thy love</li>
  <li class="number">As ever in ambitious strength I did</li>
  <li>Contend against thy valour. Know thou first,</li>
  <li>I loved the maid I married; never man</li>
  <li>Sigh'd truer breath; but that I see thee here,</li>
  <li>Thou noble thing! more dances my rapt heart</li>
  <li class="number">Than when I first my wedded mistress saw</li>
  <li>Bestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars! I tell thee,</li>
  <li>We have a power on foot; and I had purpose</li>
  <li>Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,</li>
  <li>Or lose mine arm fort: thou hast beat me out</li>
  <li class="number">Twelve several times, and I have nightly since</li>
  <li>Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me;</li>
  <li>We have been down together in my sleep,</li>
  <li>Unbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat,</li>
  <li>And waked half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius,</li>
  <li class="number">Had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that</li>
  <li>Thou art thence banish'd, we would muster all</li>
  <li>From twelve to seventy, and pouring war</li>
  <li>Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,</li>
  <li>Like a bold flood o'er-bear. O, come, go in,</li>
  <li class="number">And take our friendly senators by the hands;</li>
  <li>Who now are here, taking their leaves of me,</li>
  <li>Who am prepared against your territories,</li>
  <li>Though not for Rome itself.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CORIOLANUS</li>
  <li>You bless me, gods!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">AUFIDIUS</li>
  <li class="number">Therefore, most absolute sir, if thou wilt have</li>
  <li>The leading of thine own revenges, take</li>
  <li>The one half of my commission; and set down — </li>
  <li>As best thou art experienced, since thou know'st</li>
  <li>Thy country's strength and weakness —  thine own ways;</li>
  <li class="number">Whether to knock against the gates of Rome,</li>
  <li>Or rudely visit them in parts remote,</li>
  <li>To fright them, ere destroy. But come in:</li>
  <li>Let me commend thee first to those that shall</li>
  <li>Say yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes!</li>
  <li class="number">And more a friend than e'er an enemy;</li>
  <li>Yet, Marcius, that was much. Your hand: most welcome!</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS. The two
Servingmen come forward</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Servingman</li>
  <li>Here's a strange alteration!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Servingman</li>
  <li>By my hand, I had thought to have strucken him with</li>
  <li>a cudgel; and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a</li>
  <li class="number">false report of him.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Servingman</li>
  <li>What an arm he has! he turned me about with his</li>
  <li>finger and his thumb, as one would set up a top.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Servingman</li>
  <li>Nay, I knew by his face that there was something in</li>
  <li>him: he had, sir, a kind of face, methought —  I</li>
  <li class="number">cannot tell how to term it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Servingman</li>
  <li>He had so; looking as it were — would I were hanged,</li>
  <li>but I thought there was more in him than I could think.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Servingman</li>
  <li>So did I, I'll be sworn: he is simply the rarest</li>
  <li>man i' the world.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Servingman</li>
  <li class="number">I think he is: but a greater soldier than he you wot on.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Servingman</li>
  <li>Who, my master?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Servingman</li>
  <li>Nay, it's no matter for that.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Servingman</li>
  <li>Worth six on him.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Servingman</li>
  <li>Nay, not so neither: but I take him to be the</li>
  <li class="number">greater soldier.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Servingman</li>
  <li>Faith, look you, one cannot tell how to say that:</li>
  <li>for the defence of a town, our general is excellent.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Servingman</li>
  <li>Ay, and for an assault too.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Re-enter third Servingman</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Third Servingman</li>
  <li>O slaves, I can tell you news —   news, you rascals!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Servingman</li>
  <li class="speaker">Second Servingman</li>
  <li class="number">What, what, what? let's partake.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Third Servingman</li>
  <li>I would not be a Roman, of all nations; I had as</li>
  <li>lieve be a condemned man.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Servingman</li>
  <li class="speaker">Second Servingman</li>
  <li>Wherefore? wherefore?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Third Servingman</li>
  <li>Why, here's he that was wont to thwack our general,</li>
  <li class="number">Caius Marcius.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Servingman</li>
  <li>Why do you say 'thwack our general '?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Third Servingman</li>
  <li>I do not say 'thwack our general;' but he was always</li>
  <li>good enough for him.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Servingman</li>
  <li>Come, we are fellows and friends: he was ever too</li>
  <li class="number">hard for him; I have heard him say so himself.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Servingman</li>
  <li>He was too hard for him directly, to say the troth</li>
  <li>on't::before Corioli he scotched him and notched</li>
  <li>him like a carbon ado.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Servingman</li>
  <li>An he had been cannibally given, he might have</li>
  <li class="number">broiled and eaten him too.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Servingman</li>
  <li>But, more of thy news?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Third Servingman</li>
  <li>Why, he is so made on here within, as if he were son</li>
  <li>and heir to Mars; set at upper end o' the table; no</li>
  <li>question asked him by any of the senators, but they</li>
  <li class="number">stand bald before him: our general himself makes a</li>
  <li>mistress of him: sanctifies himself with's hand and</li>
  <li>turns up the white o' the eye to his discourse. But</li>
  <li>the bottom of the news is that our general is cut i'</li>
  <li>the middle and but one half of what he was</li>
  <li class="number">yesterday; for the other has half, by the entreaty</li>
  <li>and grant of the whole table. He'll go, he says,</li>
  <li>and sowl the porter of Rome gates by the ears: he</li>
  <li>will mow all down before him, and leave his passage polled.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Servingman</li>
  <li>And he's as like to do't as any man I can imagine.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Third Servingman</li>
  <li class="number">Do't! he will do't; for, look you, sir, he has as</li>
  <li>many friends as enemies; which friends, sir, as it</li>
  <li>were, durst not, look you, sir, show themselves, as</li>
  <li>we term it, his friends whilst he's in directitude.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Servingman</li>
  <li>Directitude! what's that?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Third Servingman</li>
  <li class="number">But when they shall see, sir, his crest up again,</li>
  <li>and the man in blood, they will out of their</li>
  <li>burrows, like conies after rain, and revel all with</li>
  <li>him.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Servingman</li>
  <li>But when goes this forward?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Third Servingman</li>
  <li class="number">To-morrow; to-day; presently; you shall have the</li>
  <li>drum struck up this afternoon: 'tis, as it were, a</li>
  <li>parcel of their feast, and to be executed ere they</li>
  <li>wipe their lips.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Servingman</li>
  <li>Why, then we shall have a stirring world again.</li>
  <li class="number">This peace is nothing, but to rust iron, increase</li>
  <li>tailors, and breed ballad-makers.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Servingman</li>
  <li>Let me have war, say I; it exceeds peace as far as</li>
  <li>day does night; it's spritely, waking, audible, and</li>
  <li>full of vent. Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy;</li>
  <li class="number">mulled, deaf, sleepy, insensible; a getter of more</li>
  <li>bastard children than war's a destroyer of men.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Servingman</li>
  <li>'Tis so: and as war, in some sort, may be said to</li>
  <li>be a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is a</li>
  <li>great maker of cuckolds.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Servingman</li>
  <li class="number">Ay, and it makes men hate one another.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Third Servingman</li>
  <li>Reason; because they then less need one another.</li>
  <li>The wars for my money. I hope to see Romans as cheap</li>
  <li>as Volscians. They are rising, they are rising.</li>
</ol>

  <li>Caius Marcius was</li>

  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>'Tis Aufidius,</li>

  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>Cannot be!</li>
  <li>We have record that very well it can,</li>
  <li class="number">And three examples of the like have been</li>
  <li>Within my age. But reason with the fellow,</li>
  <li>Before you punish him, where he heard this,</li>
  <li>Lest you shall chance to whip your information</li>

  <li>The nobles in great earnestness are going</li>

  <li class="speaker">SICINIUS</li>
  <li>What more fearful?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Messenger</li>
  <li>It is spoke freely out of many mouths — </li>
  <li class="number">How probable I do not know — that Marcius,</li>
  <li>Join'd with Aufidius, leads a power 'gainst Rome,</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">COMINIUS</li>
  <li>If!</li>

  <li>Ay; and you'll look pale</li>
  <li>Before you find it other. All the regions</li>

  <li class="number">And perish constant fools. Who is't can blame him?</li>
  <li>Your enemies and his find something in him.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">

  <li>We are all undone, unless</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">COMINIUS</li>
  <li>Who shall ask it?</li>
  <li class="number">The tribunes cannot do't for shame; the people</li>

  <li>Does of the shepherds: for his best friends, if they</li>
  <li>Should say 'Be good to Rome,' they charged him even</li>
  <li>As those should do that had deserved his hate,</li>
  <li class="number">And therein show'd like enemies.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>'Tis true:</li>
  <li>If he were putting to my house the brand</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">COMINIUS</li>
  <li>But I fear</li>
  <li>They'll roar him in again. Tullus Aufidius,</li>

  <li class="speaker">AUFIDIUS</li>
  <li>Do they still fly to the Roman?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Lieutenant</li>
  <li>I do not know what witchcraft's in him, but</li>
  <li>Your soldiers use him as the grace 'fore meat,</li>
  <li>Their talk at table, and their thanks at end;</li>
  <li class="number">And you are darken'd in this action, sir,</li>
  <li>Even by your own.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">AUFIDIUS</li>
  <li>I cannot help it now,</li>
  <li>Unless, by using means, I lame the foot</li>
  <li>Of our design. He bears himself more proudlier,</li>
  <li class="number">Even to my person, than I thought he would</li>
  <li>When first I did embrace him: yet his nature</li>
  <li>In that's no changeling; and I must excuse</li>
  <li>What cannot be amended.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Lieutenant</li>
  <li>Yet I wish, sir —  </li>
  <li class="number">I mean for your particular —  you had not</li>
  <li>Join'd in commission with him; but either</li>
  <li>Had borne the action of yourself, or else</li>
  <li>To him had left it solely.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">AUFIDIUS</li>
  <li>I understand thee well; and be thou sure,</li>
  <li class="number">when he shall come to his account, he knows not</li>
  <li>What I can urge against him. Although it seems,</li>
  <li>And so he thinks, and is no less apparent</li>
  <li>To the vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly.</li>
  <li>And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state,</li>
  <li class="number">Fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soon</li>
  <li>As draw his sword; yet he hath left undone</li>
  <li>That which shall break his neck or hazard mine,</li>
  <li>Whene'er we come to our account.</li>
</ol>

  <li class="speaker">Lieutenant</li>
  <li>Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">AUFIDIUS</li>
  <li class="number">All places yield to him ere he sits down;</li>
  <li>And the nobility of Rome are his:</li>
  <li>The senators and patricians love him too:</li>
  <li>The tribunes are no soldiers; and their people</li>
  <li>Will be as rash in the repeal, as hasty</li>
  <li class="number">To expel him thence. I think he'll be to Rome</li>
  <li>As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it</li>
  <li>By sovereignty of nature. First he was</li>
  <li>A noble servant to them; but he could not</li>
  <li>Carry his honours even: whether 'twas pride,</li>
  <li class="number">Which out of daily fortune ever taints</li>
  <li>The happy man; whether defect of judgment,</li>
  <li>To fail in the disposing of those chances</li>
  <li>Which he was lord of; or whether nature,</li>
  <li>Not to be other than one thing, not moving</li>
  <li class="number">From the casque to the cushion, but commanding peace</li>
  <li>Even with the same austerity and garb</li>
  <li>As he controll'd the war; but one of these — </li>
  <li>As he hath spices of them all, not all,</li>
  <li>For I dare so far free him — made him fear'd,</li>
  <li class="number">So hated, and so banish'd: but he has a merit,</li>
  <li>To choke it in the utterance. So our virtues</li>
  <li>Lie in the interpretation of the time:</li>
  <li>And power, unto itself most commendable,</li>
  <li>Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair</li>
  <li class="number">To extol what it hath done.</li>
  <li>One fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail;</li>
  <li>Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.</li>
  <li>Come, let's away. When, Caius, Rome is thine,</li>

  <li>No, I'll not go: you hear what he hath said</li>

  <li class="number">A mile before his tent fall down, and knee</li>

  <li>Do you hear?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">COMINIUS</li>
  <li class="number">Yet one time he did call me by my name:</li>
  <li>I urged our old acquaintance, and the drops</li>
  <li>That we have bled together. Coriolanus</li>
  <li>He would not answer to: forbad all names;</li>
  <li>He was a kind of nothing, titleless,</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>Why, so: you have made good work!</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">COMINIUS</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>Very well:</li>
  <li class="number">Could he say less?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">COMINIUS</li>
  <li>I offer'd to awaken his regard</li>
  <li>For's private friends: his answer to me was,</li>
  <li>He could not stay to pick them in a pile</li>
  <li>Of noisome musty chaff: he said 'twas folly,</li>
  <li class="number">For one poor grain or two, to leave unburnt,</li>
  <li>And still to nose the offence.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>For one poor grain or two!</li>
  <li>I am one of those; his mother, wife, his child,</li>
  <li>And this brave fellow too, we are the grains:</li>
  <li class="number">You are the musty chaff; and you are smelt</li>
  <li>Above the moon: we must be burnt for you.</li>

  <li class="speaker">SICINIUS</li>
  <li>Nay, pray, be patient: if you refuse your aid</li>
  <li>In this so never-needed help, yet do not</li>

  <li class="number">Would be your country's pleader, your good tongue,</li>
  <li>More than the instant army we can make,</li>

  <li>He was not taken well; he had not dined:</li>
  <li class="number">The veins unfill'd, our blood is cold, and then</li>
  <li>We pout upon the morning, are unapt</li>

  <li>With wine and feeding, we have suppler souls</li>
  <li class="number">Than in our priest-like fasts: therefore I'll watch him</li>

  <li>Stand, and go back.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>You guard like men; 'tis well: but, by your leave,</li>
  <li>I am an officer of state, and come</li>
  <li class="number">To speak with Coriolanus.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Senator</li>
  <li>From whence?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>From Rome.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Senator</li>
  <li>You may not pass, you must return: our general</li>
  <li>Will no more hear from thence.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Senator</li>
  <li class="number">You'll see your Rome embraced with fire before</li>
  <li>You'll speak with Coriolanus.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>Good my friends,</li>
  <li>If you have heard your general talk of Rome,</li>
  <li>And of his friends there, it is lots to blanks,</li>
  <li class="number">My name hath touch'd your ears it is Menenius.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Senator</li>
  <li>Be it so; go back: the virtue of your name</li>
  <li>Is not here passable.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>I tell thee, fellow,</li>
  <li>The general is my lover: I have been</li>
  <li class="number">The book of his good acts, whence men have read</li>
  <li>His name unparallel'd, haply amplified;</li>
  <li>For I have ever verified my friends,</li>
  <li>Of whom he's chief, with all the size that verity</li>
  <li>Would without lapsing suffer: nay, sometimes,</li>
  <li class="number">Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground,</li>
  <li>I have tumbled past the throw; and in his praise</li>
  <li>Have almost stamp'd the leasing: therefore, fellow,</li>
  <li>I must have leave to pass.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Senator</li>
  <li>Faith, sir, if you had told as many lies in his</li>
  <li class="number">behalf as you have uttered words in your own, you</li>
  <li>should not pass here; no, though it were as virtuous</li>
  <li>to lie as to live chastely. Therefore, go back.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>Prithee, fellow, remember my name is Menenius,</li>
  <li>always factionary on the party of your general.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Senator</li>
  <li class="number">Howsoever you have been his liar, as you say you</li>
  <li>have, I am one that, telling true under him, must</li>
  <li>say, you cannot pass. Therefore, go back.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>Has he dined, canst thou tell? for I would not</li>
  <li>speak with him till after dinner.</li>

  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>I am, as thy general is.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Senator</li>
  <li>Then you should hate Rome, as he does. Can you,</li>
  <li>when you have pushed out your gates the very</li>
  <li>defender of them, and, in a violent popular</li>
  <li class="number">ignorance, given your enemy your shield, think to</li>
  <li>front his revenges with the easy groans of old</li>
  <li>women, the virginal palms of your daughters, or with</li>
  <li>the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as</li>
  <li>you seem to be? Can you think to blow out the</li>
  <li class="number">intended fire your city is ready to flame in, with</li>
  <li>such weak breath as this? No, you are deceived;</li>
  <li>therefore, back to Rome, and prepare for your</li>
  <li>execution: you are condemned, our general has sworn</li>
  <li>you out of reprieve and pardon.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li class="number">Sirrah, if thy captain knew I were here, he would</li>
  <li>use me with estimation.</li>

  <li>Come, my captain knows you not.</li>

  <li>I mean, thy general.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Senator</li>
  <li>My general cares not for you. Back, I say, go; lest</li>
  <li class="number">I let forth your half-pint of blood; back —  that's</li>
  <li>the utmost of your having: back.</li>

  <li>What's the matter?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>Now, you companion, I'll say an errand for you:</li>
  <li class="number">You shall know now that I am in estimation; you shall</li>
  <li>perceive that a Jack guardant cannot office me from</li>
  <li>my son Coriolanus: guess, but by my entertainment</li>
  <li>with him, if thou standest not i' the state of</li>
  <li>hanging, or of some death more long in</li>

  <li>presently, and swoon for what's to come upon thee.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">To CORIOLANUS</li>
  <li>The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy</li>

  <li>thy old father Menenius does! O my son, my son!</li>
  <li class="number">thou art preparing fire for us; look thee, here's</li>
  <li>water to quench it. I was hardly moved to come to</li>
  <li>thee; but being assured none but myself could move</li>
  <li>thee, I have been blown out of your gates with</li>
  <li>sighs; and conjure thee to pardon Rome, and thy</li>
  <li class="number">petitionary countrymen. The good gods assuage thy</li>
  <li>wrath, and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet</li>
  <li>here —  this, who, like a block, hath denied my</li>

  <li>Mine ears against your suits are stronger than</li>

  <li>Take this along; I writ it for thy sake</li>

  <li class="speaker">CORIOLANUS</li>

  <li>Whom with a crack'd heart I have sent to Rome,</li>

  <li>Nay, godded me, indeed. Their latest refuge</li>
  <li>Was to send him; for whose old love I have,</li>
  <li class="number">Though I show'd sourly to him, once more offer'd</li>
  <li>The first conditions, which they did refuse</li>

  <li>I have yielded to: fresh embassies and suits,</li>

  <li>What is that curt'sy worth? or those doves' eyes,</li>

  <li>Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you:</li>
  <li>He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy:</li>
  <li>Perhaps thy childishness will move him more</li>
  <li>Than can our reasons. There's no man in the world</li>
  <li class="number">More bound to 's mother; yet here he lets me prate</li>
  <li>Like one i' the stocks. Thou hast never in thy life</li>

  <li>When she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,</li>
  <li>Has cluck'd thee to the wars and safely home,</li>

  <li>Thou art not honest; and the gods will plague thee,</li>
  <li>That thou restrain'st from me the duty which</li>
  <li>To a mother's part belongs. He turns away:</li>
  <li class="number">Down, ladies; let us shame him with our knees.</li>
  <li>To his surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride</li>
  <li>Than pity to our prayers. Down: an end;</li>
  <li>This is the last: so we will home to Rome,</li>
  <li>And die among our neighbours. Nay, behold 's:</li>
  <li class="number">This boy, that cannot tell what he would have</li>
  <li>But kneels and holds up bands for fellowship,</li>
  <li>Does reason our petition with more strength</li>
  <li>Than thou hast to deny 't. Come, let us go:</li>

  <li>O mother, mother!</li>

  <li>They laugh at. O my mother, mother! O!</li>
  <li>You have won a happy victory to Rome;</li>

  <li>Aufidius, though I cannot make true wars,</li>

<h3>SCENE IV.  Rome. A public place.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter MENENIUS and SICINIUS</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>See you yond coign o' the Capitol, yond</li>
  <li>corner-stone?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SICINIUS</li>
  <li>Why, what of that?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>If it be possible for you to displace it with your</li>
  <li class="number">little finger, there is some hope the ladies of</li>
  <li>Rome, especially his mother, may prevail with him.</li>
  <li>But I say there is no hope in't: our throats are</li>
  <li>sentenced and stay upon execution.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SICINIUS</li>
  <li>Is't possible that so short a time can alter the</li>
  <li class="number">condition of a man!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>There is differency between a grub and a butterfly;</li>
  <li>yet your butterfly was a grub. This Marcius is grown</li>
  <li>from man to dragon: he has wings; he's more than a</li>
  <li>creeping thing.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SICINIUS</li>
  <li class="number">He loved his mother dearly.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>So did he me: and he no more remembers his mother</li>
  <li>now than an eight-year-old horse. The tartness</li>
  <li>of his face sours ripe grapes: when he walks, he</li>
  <li>moves like an engine, and the ground shrinks before</li>
  <li class="number">his treading: he is able to pierce a corslet with</li>
  <li>his eye; talks like a knell, and his hum is a</li>
  <li>battery. He sits in his state, as a thing made for</li>
  <li>Alexander. What he bids be done is finished with</li>
  <li>his bidding. He wants nothing of a god but eternity</li>
  <li class="number">and a heaven to throne in.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SICINIUS</li>
  <li>Yes, mercy, if you report him truly.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>I paint him in the character. Mark what mercy his</li>
  <li>mother shall bring from him: there is no more mercy</li>
  <li>in him than there is milk in a male tiger; that</li>
  <li class="number">shall our poor city find: and all this is long of</li>
  <li>you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SICINIUS</li>
  <li>The gods be good unto us!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MENENIUS</li>
  <li>No, in such a case the gods will not be good unto</li>
  <li>us. When we banished him, we respected not them;</li>
  <li class="number">and, he returning to break our necks, they respect not us.</li>

  <li class="number">How is it with our general?</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">AUFIDIUS</li>
  <li>Even so</li>

  <li>Sir, I cannot tell:</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Third Conspirator</li>
  <li class="number">The people will remain uncertain whilst</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">AUFIDIUS</li>
  <li>I know it;</li>
  <li>And my pretext to strike at him admits</li>
  <li class="number">A good construction. I raised him, and I pawn'd</li>
  <li>Mine honour for his truth: who being so heighten'd,</li>
  <li>He water'd his new plants with dews of flattery,</li>
  <li>Seducing so my friends; and, to this end,</li>
  <li>He bow'd his nature, never known before</li>
  <li class="number">But to be rough, unswayable and free.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Third Conspirator</li>
  <li>Sir, his stoutness</li>
  <li>When he did stand for consul, which he lost</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">AUFIDIUS</li>
  <li>That I would have spoke of:</li>
  <li class="number">Being banish'd for't, he came unto my hearth;</li>
  <li>Presented to my knife his throat: I took him;</li>
  <li>Made him joint-servant with me; gave him way</li>
  <li>In all his own desires; nay, let him choose</li>
  <li>Out of my files, his projects to accomplish,</li>
  <li class="number">My best and freshest men; served his designments</li>
  <li>In mine own person; holp to reap the fame</li>
  <li>Which he did end all his; and took some pride</li>
  <li>To do myself this wrong: till, at the last,</li>
  <li>I seem'd his follower, not partner, and</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Conspirator</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">AUFIDIUS</li>
  <li>There was it:</li>
  <li>For which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him.</li>
  <li>At a few drops of women's rheum, which are</li>
  <li>As cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labour</li>

  <li>Breaking his oath and resolution like</li>
  <li>A twist of rotten silk, never admitting</li>
  <li>Counsel o' the war, but at his nurse's tears</li>
