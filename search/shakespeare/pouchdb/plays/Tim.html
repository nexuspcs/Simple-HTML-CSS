<h3>SCENE I.  Athens. A hall in Timon's house.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter Poet, Painter, Jeweller, Merchant, and
others, at several doors</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Poet</li>
  <li>Good day, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Painter</li>
  <li>I am glad you're well.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Poet</li>
  <li>I have not seen you long: how goes the world?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Painter</li>
  <li>It wears, sir, as it grows.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Poet</li>
  <li class="number">Ay, that's well known:</li>
  <li>But what particular rarity? what strange,</li>
  <li>Which manifold record not matches? See,</li>
  <li>Magic of bounty! all these spirits thy power</li>
  <li>Hath conjured to attend. I know the merchant.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Painter</li>
  <li class="number">I know them both; th' other's a jeweller.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Merchant</li>
  <li>O, 'tis a worthy lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Jeweller</li>
  <li>Nay, that's most fix'd.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Merchant</li>
  <li>A most incomparable man, breathed, as it were,</li>
  <li>To an untirable and continuate goodness:</li>
  <li class="number">He passes.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Jeweller:</li>
  <li>I have a jewel here — </li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Merchant</li>
  <li>O, pray, let's see't: for the Lord Timon, sir?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Jeweller:</li>
  <li>If he will touch the estimate: but, for that — </li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Poet</li>
  <li>Reciting to himself  'When we for recompense have</li>
  <li class="number">praised the vile,</li>
  <li>It stains the glory in that happy verse</li>
  <li>Which aptly sings the good.'</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Merchant</li>
  <li>'Tis a good form.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Looking at the jewel</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Jeweller</li>
  <li>And rich: here is a water, look ye.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Painter</li>
  <li class="number">You are rapt, sir, in some work, some dedication</li>
  <li>To the great lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Poet</li>
  <li>A thing slipp'd idly from me.</li>
  <li>Our poesy is as a gum, which oozes</li>
  <li>From whence 'tis nourish'd: the fire i' the flint</li>
  <li class="number">Shows not till it be struck; our gentle flame</li>
  <li>Provokes itself and like the current flies</li>
  <li>Each bound it chafes. What have you there?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Painter</li>
  <li>A picture, sir. When comes your book forth?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Poet</li>
  <li>Upon the heels of my presentment, sir.</li>
  <li class="number">Let's see your piece.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Painter</li>
  <li>'Tis a good piece.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Poet</li>
  <li>So 'tis: this comes off well and excellent.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Painter</li>
  <li>Indifferent.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Poet</li>
  <li>Admirable: how this grace</li>
  <li class="number">Speaks his own standing! what a mental power</li>
  <li>This eye shoots forth! how big imagination</li>
  <li>Moves in this lip! to the dumbness of the gesture</li>
  <li>One might interpret.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Painter</li>
  <li>It is a pretty mocking of the life.</li>
  <li class="number">Here is a touch; is't good?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Poet</li>
  <li>I will say of it,</li>
  <li>It tutors nature: artificial strife</li>
  <li>Lives in these touches, livelier than life.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter certain Senators, and pass over</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Painter</li>
  <li>How this lord is follow'd!</li>

  <li class="speaker">Poet</li>
  <li class="number">The senators of Athens: happy man!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Painter</li>
  <li>Look, more!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Poet</li>
  <li>You see this confluence, this great flood</li>
  <li>of visitors.</li>
  <li>I have, in this rough work, shaped out a man,</li>
  <li class="number">Whom this beneath world doth embrace and hug</li>
  <li>With amplest entertainment: my free drift</li>
  <li>Halts not particularly, but moves itself</li>
  <li>In a wide sea of wax: no levell'd malice</li>
  <li>Infects one comma in the course I hold;</li>
  <li class="number">But flies an eagle flight, bold and forth on,</li>
  <li>Leaving no tract behind.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Painter</li>
  <li>How shall I understand you?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Poet</li>
  <li>I will unbolt to you.</li>
  <li>You see how all conditions, how all minds,</li>
  <li class="number">As well of glib and slippery creatures as</li>
  <li>Of grave and austere quality, tender down</li>
  <li>Their services to Lord Timon: his large fortune</li>
  <li>Upon his good and gracious nature hanging</li>
  <li>Subdues and properties to his love and tendance</li>
  <li class="number">All sorts of hearts; yea, from the glass-faced flatterer</li>
  <li>To Apemantus, that few things loves better</li>
  <li>Than to abhor himself: even he drops down</li>
  <li>The knee before him, and returns in peace</li>
  <li>Most rich in Timon's nod.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Painter</li>
  <li class="number">I saw them speak together.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Poet</li>
  <li>Sir, I have upon a high and pleasant hill</li>
  <li>Feign'd Fortune to be throned: the base o' the mount</li>
  <li>Is rank'd with all deserts, all kind of natures,</li>
  <li>That labour on the bosom of this sphere</li>
  <li class="number">To propagate their states: amongst them all,</li>
  <li>Whose eyes are on this sovereign lady fix'd,</li>
  <li>One do I personate of Lord Timon's frame,</li>
  <li>Whom Fortune with her ivory hand wafts to her;</li>
  <li>Whose present grace to present slaves and servants</li>
  <li class="number">Translates his rivals.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Painter</li>
  <li>'Tis conceived to scope.</li>
  <li>This throne, this Fortune, and this hill, methinks,</li>
  <li>With one man beckon'd from the rest below,</li>
  <li>Bowing his head against the sleepy mount</li>
  <li class="number">To climb his happiness, would be well express'd</li>
  <li>In our condition.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Poet</li>
  <li>Nay, sir, but hear me on.</li>
  <li>All those which were his fellows but of late,</li>
  <li>Some better than his value, on the moment</li>
  <li class="number">Follow his strides, his lobbies fill with tendance,</li>
  <li>Rain sacrificial whisperings in his ear,</li>
  <li>Make sacred even his stirrup, and through him</li>
  <li>Drink the free air.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Painter</li>
  <li>Ay, marry, what of these?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Poet</li>
  <li class="number">When Fortune in her shift and change of mood</li>
  <li>Spurns down her late beloved, all his dependants</li>
  <li>Which labour'd after him to the mountain's top</li>
  <li>Even on their knees and hands, let him slip down,</li>
  <li>Not one accompanying his declining foot.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Painter</li>
  <li class="number">'Tis common:</li>
  <li>A thousand moral paintings I can show</li>
  <li>That shall demonstrate these quick blows of Fortune's</li>
  <li>More pregnantly than words. Yet you do well</li>
  <li>To show Lord Timon that mean eyes have seen</li>
  <li class="number">The foot above the head.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Trumpets sound. Enter TIMON, addressing himself
courteously to every suitor; a Messenger from
VENTIDIUS talking with him; LUCILIUS and other
servants following</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TIMON</li>
  <li>Imprison'd is he, say you?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Messenger</li>
  <li>Ay, my good lord: five talents is his debt,</li>
  <li>His means most short, his creditors most strait:</li>
  <li>Your honourable letter he desires</li>
  <li class="number">To those have shut him up; which failing,</li>
  <li>Periods his comfort.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TIMON</li>
  <li>Noble Ventidius! Well;</li>
  <li>I am not of that feather to shake off</li>
  <li>My friend when he must need me. I do know him</li>
  <li class="number">A gentleman that well deserves a help:</li>
  <li>Which he shall have: I'll pay the debt,</li>
  <li>and free him.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Messenger</li>
  <li>Your lordship ever binds him.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TIMON</li>
  <li>Commend me to him: I will send his ransom;</li>
  <li class="number">And being enfranchised, bid him come to me.</li>
  <li>'Tis not enough to help the feeble up,</li>
  <li>But to support him after. Fare you well.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Messenger</li>
  <li>All happiness to your honour!</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter an old Athenian</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Old Athenian</li>
  <li>Lord Timon, hear me speak.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TIMON</li>
  <li class="number">Freely, good father.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Old Athenian</li>
  <li>Thou hast a servant named Lucilius.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TIMON</li>
  <li>I have so: what of him?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Old Athenian</li>
  <li>Most noble Timon, call the man before thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TIMON</li>
  <li>Attends he here, or no? Lucilius!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LUCILIUS</li>
  <li class="number">Here, at your lordship's service.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Old Athenian</li>
  <li>This fellow here, Lord Timon, this thy creature,</li>
  <li>By night frequents my house. I am a man</li>
  <li>That from my first have been inclined to thrift;</li>
  <li>And my estate deserves an heir more raised</li>
  <li class="number">Than one which holds a trencher.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TIMON</li>
  <li>Well; what further?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Old Athenian</li>
  <li>One only daughter have I, no kin else,</li>
  <li>On whom I may confer what I have got:</li>
  <li>The maid is fair, o' the youngest for a bride,</li>
  <li class="number">And I have bred her at my dearest cost</li>
  <li>In qualities of the best. This man of thine</li>
  <li>Attempts her love: I prithee, noble lord,</li>
  <li>Join with me to forbid him her resort;</li>
  <li>Myself have spoke in vain.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TIMON</li>
  <li class="number">The man is honest.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Old Athenian</li>
  <li>Therefore he will be, Timon:</li>
  <li>His honesty rewards him in itself;</li>
  <li>It must not bear my daughter.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TIMON</li>
  <li>Does she love him?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Old Athenian</li>
  <li class="number">She is young and apt:</li>
  <li>Our own precedent passions do instruct us</li>
  <li>What levity's in youth.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TIMON</li>
  <li>To LUCILIUS           Love you the maid?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LUCILIUS</li>
  <li>Ay, my good lord, and she accepts of it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Old Athenian</li>
  <li class="number">If in her marriage my consent be missing,</li>
  <li>I call the gods to witness, I will choose</li>
  <li>Mine heir from forth the beggars of the world,</li>
  <li>And dispossess her all.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TIMON</li>
  <li>How shall she be endow'd,</li>
  <li class="number">if she be mated with an equal husband?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Old Athenian</li>
  <li>Three talents on the present; in future, all.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TIMON</li>
  <li>This gentleman of mine hath served me long:</li>
  <li>To build his fortune I will strain a little,</li>
  <li>For 'tis a bond in men. Give him thy daughter:</li>
  <li class="number">What you bestow, in him I'll counterpoise,</li>
  <li>And make him weigh with her.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Old Athenian</li>
  <li>Most noble lord,</li>
  <li>Pawn me to this your honour, she is his.</li>

  <li class="speaker">TIMON</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Painter</li>
  <li>A piece of painting, which I do beseech</li>
  <li>Your lordship to accept.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TIMON</li>
  <li>Painting is welcome.</li>
  <li>The painting is almost the natural man;</li>
  <li class="number">or since dishonour traffics with man's nature,</li>
  <li>He is but outside: these pencill'd figures are</li>
  <li>Even such as they give out. I like your work;</li>
  <li>And you shall find I like it: wait attendance</li>
  <li>Till you hear further from me.</li>

  <li>What, my lord! dispraise?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TIMON</li>
  <li class="number">A more satiety of commendations.</li>
  <li>If I should pay you for't as 'tis extoll'd,</li>
  <li>It would unclew me quite.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Jeweller</li>
  <li>My lord, 'tis rated</li>
  <li>As those which sell would give: but you well know,</li>
  <li class="number">Things of like value differing in the owners</li>
  <li>Are prized by their masters: believe't, dear lord,</li>
  <li>You mend the jewel by the wearing it.</li>

  <li class="speaker">TIMON</li>
  <li>Well mock'd.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Merchant</li>
  <li>No, my good lord; he speaks the common tongue,</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Hautboys playing loud music. A great banquet
served in; FLAVIUS and others attending; then enter
TIMON, ALCIBIADES, Lords, Senators, and VENTIDIUS.
Then comes, dropping, after all, APEMANTUS,
discontentedly, like himself</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">VENTIDIUS</li>
  <li>Most honour'd Timon,</li>
  <li>It hath pleased the gods to remember my father's age,</li>
  <li>And call him to long peace.</li>
  <li>He is gone happy, and has left me rich:</li>
  <li class="number">Then, as in grateful virtue I am bound</li>
  <li>To your free heart, I do return those talents,</li>
  <li>Doubled with thanks and service, from whose help</li>
  <li>I derived liberty.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TIMON</li>
  <li>O, by no means,</li>
  <li class="number">Honest Ventidius; you mistake my love:</li>
  <li>I gave it freely ever; and there's none</li>
  <li>Can truly say he gives, if he receives:</li>
  <li>If our betters play at that game, we must not dare</li>
  <li>To imitate them; faults that are rich are fair.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">VENTIDIUS</li>
  <li class="number">A noble spirit!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TIMON</li>
  <li>Nay, my lords,</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">They all stand ceremoniously looking on TIMON</li>
  <li>Ceremony was but devised at first</li>
  <li>To set a gloss on faint deeds, hollow welcomes,</li>
  <li>Recanting goodness, sorry ere 'tis shown;</li>
  <li class="number">But where there is true friendship, there needs none.</li>
  <li>Pray, sit; more welcome are ye to my fortunes</li>
  <li>Than my fortunes to me.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">They sit</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Lord</li>
  <li>My lord, we always have confess'd it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">APEMANTUS</li>
  <li>Ho, ho, confess'd it! hang'd it, have you not?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TIMON</li>
  <li class="number">O, Apemantus, you are welcome.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">APEMANTUS</li>
  <li>No;</li>
  <li>You shall not make me welcome:</li>
  <li>I come to have thee thrust me out of doors.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TIMON</li>
  <li>Fie, thou'rt a churl; ye've got a humour there</li>
  <li class="number">Does not become a man: 'tis much to blame.</li>
  <li>They say, my lords, 'ira furor brevis est;' but yond</li>
  <li>man is ever angry. Go, let him have a table by</li>
  <li>himself, for he does neither affect company, nor is</li>
  <li>he fit for't, indeed.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">APEMANTUS</li>
  <li class="number">Let me stay at thine apperil, Timon: I come to</li>
  <li>observe; I give thee warning on't.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TIMON</li>
  <li>I take no heed of thee; thou'rt an Athenian,</li>
  <li>therefore welcome: I myself would have no power;</li>
  <li>prithee, let my meat make thee silent.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">APEMANTUS</li>
  <li class="number">I scorn thy meat; 'twould choke me, for I should</li>
  <li>ne'er flatter thee. O you gods, what a number of</li>
  <li>men eat Timon, and he sees 'em not! It grieves me</li>
  <li>to see so many dip their meat in one man's blood;</li>
  <li>and all the madness is, he cheers them up too.</li>
  <li class="number">I wonder men dare trust themselves with men:</li>
  <li>Methinks they should invite them without knives;</li>
  <li>Good for their meat, and safer for their lives.</li>
  <li>There's much example for't; the fellow that sits</li>
  <li>next him now, parts bread with him, pledges the</li>
  <li class="number">breath of him in a divided draught, is the readiest</li>
  <li>man to kill him: 't has been proved. If I were a</li>
  <li>huge man, I should fear to drink at meals;</li>
  <li>Lest they should spy my windpipe's dangerous notes:</li>
  <li>Great men should drink with harness on their throats.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TIMON</li>
  <li class="number">My lord, in heart; and let the health go round.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Lord</li>
  <li>Let it flow this way, my good lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">APEMANTUS</li>
  <li>Flow this way! A brave fellow! he keeps his tides</li>
  <li>well. Those healths will make thee and thy state</li>
  <li>look ill, Timon. Here's that which is too weak to</li>
  <li class="number">be a sinner, honest water, which ne'er left man i' the mire:</li>
  <li>This and my food are equals; there's no odds:</li>
  <li>Feasts are too proud to give thanks to the gods.</li>
  <li>Apemantus' grace.</li>
  <li>Immortal gods, I crave no pelf;</li>
  <li class="number">I pray for no man but myself:</li>
  <li>Grant I may never prove so fond,</li>
  <li>To trust man on his oath or bond;</li>
  <li>Or a harlot, for her weeping;</li>
  <li>Or a dog, that seems a-sleeping:</li>
  <li class="number">Or a keeper with my freedom;</li>
  <li>Or my friends, if I should need 'em.</li>
  <li>Amen. So fall to't:</li>
  <li>Rich men sin, and I eat root.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Eats and drinks</li>
  <li>Much good dich thy good heart, Apemantus!</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">APEMANTUS</li>
  <li>Would all those fatterers were thine enemies then,</li>
  <li>that then thou mightst kill 'em and bid me to 'em!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Lord</li>
  <li>Might we but have that happiness, my lord, that you</li>
  <li>would once use our hearts, whereby we might express</li>
  <li class="number">some part of our zeals, we should think ourselves</li>
  <li>for ever perfect.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TIMON</li>
  <li>O, no doubt, my good friends, but the gods</li>
  <li>themselves have provided that I shall have much help</li>
  <li>from you: how had you been my friends else? why</li>
  <li class="number">have you that charitable title from thousands, did</li>
  <li>not you chiefly belong to my heart? I have told</li>
  <li>more of you to myself than you can with modesty</li>
  <li>speak in your own behalf; and thus far I confirm</li>
  <li>you. O you gods, think I, what need we have any</li>
  <li class="number">friends, if we should ne'er have need of 'em? they</li>
  <li>were the most needless creatures living, should we</li>
  <li>ne'er have use for 'em, and would most resemble</li>
  <li>sweet instruments hung up in cases that keep their</li>
  <li>sounds to themselves. Why, I have often wished</li>
  <li class="number">myself poorer, that I might come nearer to you. We</li>
  <li>are born to do benefits: and what better or</li>
  <li>properer can we can our own than the riches of our</li>
  <li>friends? O, what a precious comfort 'tis, to have</li>
  <li>so many, like brothers, commanding one another's</li>
  <li class="number">fortunes! O joy, e'en made away ere 't can be born!</li>
  <li>Mine eyes cannot hold out water, methinks: to</li>
  <li>forget their faults, I drink to you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">APEMANTUS</li>
  <li>Thou weepest to make them drink, Timon.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Lord</li>
  <li>Joy had the like conception in our eyes</li>
  <li class="number">And at that instant like a babe sprung up.</li>
</ol>

  <li class="speaker">APEMANTUS</li>
  <li>Ho, ho! I laugh to think that babe a bastard.</li>

  <li>When, for some trifling present, you have bid me</li>
  <li class="number">Return so much, I have shook my head and wept;</li>
  <li>Yea, 'gainst the authority of manners, pray'd you</li>
  <li>To hold your hand more close: I did endure</li>
  <li>Not seldom, nor no slight cheques, when I have</li>
  <li>Prompted you in the ebb of your estate</li>
  <li class="number">And your great flow of debts. My loved lord,</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Stranger</li>
  <li>We know him for no less, though we are but strangers</li>
  <li>to him. But I can tell you one thing, my lord, and</li>
  <li class="number">which I hear from common rumours: now Lord Timon's</li>
  <li>happy hours are done and past, and his estate</li>
  <li>shrinks from him.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LUCILIUS</li>
  <li>Fie, no, do not believe it; he cannot want for money.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Stranger</li>
  <li>But believe you this, my lord, that, not long ago,</li>
  <li class="number">one of his men was with the Lord Lucullus to borrow</li>
  <li>so many talents, nay, urged extremely for't and</li>
  <li>showed what necessity belonged to't, and yet was denied.</li>

  <li class="number">What a strange case was that! now, before the gods,</li>
  <li>I am ashamed on't. Denied that honourable man!</li>
  <li>there was very little honour showed in't. For my own</li>
  <li>part, I must needs confess, I have received some</li>
  <li>small kindnesses from him, as money, plate, jewels</li>
  <li class="number">and such-like trifles, nothing comparing to his;</li>
  <li>yet, had he mistook him and sent to me, I should</li>

  <li class="number">should purchase the day before for a little part,</li>
  <li>and undo a great deal of honoured! Servilius, now,</li>
  <li>before the gods, I am not able to do —  the more</li>
  <li>beast, I say: — I was sending to use Lord Timon</li>
  <li>myself, these gentlemen can witness! but I would</li>
  <li class="number">not, for the wealth of Athens, I had done't now.</li>
  <li>Commend me bountifully to his good lordship; and I</li>

  <li>this from me, I count it one of my greatest</li>

  <li>His friend that dips in the same dish? for, in</li>
  <li>My knowing, Timon has been this lord's father,</li>
  <li>And kept his credit with his purse,</li>
  <li class="number">Supported his estate; nay, Timon's money</li>

  <li>Ay, but the days are wax'd shorter with him:</li>

  <li class="speaker">Second Lord</li>
  <li>It should not be, by the persuasion of his new feasting.</li>

  <li>I should think so: he hath sent me an earnest</li>

  <li>I must needs appear.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Lord</li>
  <li>In like manner was I in debt to my importunate</li>

  <li>Each man to his stool, with that spur as he would to</li>

  <li>places alike. Make not a city feast of it, to let</li>
  <li>the meat cool ere we can agree upon the first place:</li>
  <li class="number">sit, sit. The gods require our thanks.</li>
  <li>You great benefactors, sprinkle our society with</li>
  <li>thankfulness. For your own gifts, make yourselves</li>
  <li>praised: but reserve still to give, lest your</li>
  <li>deities be despised. Lend to each man enough, that</li>
  <li class="number">one need not lend to another; for, were your</li>
  <li>godheads to borrow of men, men would forsake the</li>
  <li>gods. Make the meat be beloved more than the man</li>
  <li>that gives it. Let no assembly of twenty be without</li>
  <li>a score of villains: if there sit twelve women at</li>
  <li class="number">the table, let a dozen of them be — as they are. The</li>
  <li>rest of your fees, O gods — the senators of Athens,</li>
  <li>together with the common lag of people — what is</li>
  <li>amiss in them, you gods, make suitable for</li>
  <li>destruction. For these my present friends, as they</li>

  <li>Moe than you rob: take wealth and lives together;</li>
  <li class="number">Do villany, do, since you protest to do't,</li>
  <li>Like workmen. I'll example you with thievery.</li>
  <li>The sun's a thief, and with his great attraction</li>

  <li>And her pale fire she snatches from the sun:</li>
  <li class="number">The sea's a thief, whose liquid surge resolves</li>
  <li>The moon into salt tears: the earth's a thief,</li>
  <li>That feeds and breeds by a composture stolen</li>
  <li>From general excrement: each thing's a thief:</li>
  <li>The laws, your curb and whip, in their rough power</li>
  <li class="number">Have uncheque'd theft. Love not yourselves: away,</li>
  <li>Rob one another. There's more gold. Cut throats:</li>
  <li>All that you meet are thieves: to Athens go,</li>
  <li>Break open shops; nothing can you steal,</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FLAVIUS</li>
  <li>An honest poor servant of yours.</li>

  <li>Then I know thee not:</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FLAVIUS</li>
  <li>The gods are witness,</li>

  <li>What, dost thou weep? Come nearer. Then I</li>
  <li class="number">love thee,</li>
  <li>Because thou art a woman, and disclaim'st</li>
  <li>Flinty mankind; whose eyes do never give</li>
  <li>But thorough lust and laughter. Pity's sleeping:</li>
  <li>Strange times, that weep with laughing, not with weeping!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FLAVIUS</li>
  <li class="number">I beg of you to know me, good my lord,</li>

  <li>Forgive my general and exceptless rashness,</li>
  <li>You perpetual-sober gods! I do proclaim</li>
  <li class="number">One honest man — mistake me not — but one;</li>
  <li>No more, I pray —  and he's a steward.</li>
  <li>How fain would I have hated all mankind!</li>
  <li>And thou redeem'st thyself: but all, save thee,</li>
  <li>I fell with curses.</li>
  <li class="number">Methinks thou art more honest now than wise;</li>
  <li>For, by oppressing and betraying me,</li>
  <li>Thou mightst have sooner got another service:</li>
  <li>For many so arrive at second masters,</li>
  <li>Upon their first lord's neck. But tell me true — </li>
  <li class="number">For I must ever doubt, though ne'er so sure — </li>
  <li>Is not thy kindness subtle, covetous,</li>
  <li>If not a usuring kindness, and, as rich men deal gifts,</li>
  <li>Expecting in return twenty for one?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FLAVIUS</li>
  <li>No, my most worthy master; in whose breast</li>
  <li class="number">Doubt and suspect, alas, are placed too late:</li>
  <li>You should have fear'd false times when you did feast:</li>
  <li>Suspect still comes where an estate is least.</li>
  <li>That which I show, heaven knows, is merely love,</li>
  <li>Duty and zeal to your unmatched mind,</li>
  <li class="number">Care of your food and living; and, believe it,</li>
  <li>My most honour'd lord,</li>
  <li>For any benefit that points to me,</li>
  <li>Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TIMON</li>
  <li>Look thee, 'tis so! Thou singly honest man,</li>
  <li>Here, take: the gods out of my misery</li>
  <li>Have sent thee treasure. Go, live rich and happy;</li>
  <li>But thus condition'd: thou shalt build from men;</li>
  <li class="number">Hate all, curse all, show charity to none,</li>
  <li>But let the famish'd flesh slide from the bone,</li>
  <li>Ere thou relieve the beggar; give to dogs</li>
  <li>What thou deny'st to men; let prisons swallow 'em,</li>
  <li>Debts wither 'em to nothing; be men like</li>
  <li class="number">blasted woods,</li>
  <li>And may diseases lick up their false bloods!</li>
  <li>And so farewell and thrive.</li>

<h3>SCENE I.  The woods. Before Timon's cave.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter Poet and Painter; TIMON watching
them from his cave</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Painter</li>
  <li>As I took note of the place, it cannot be far where</li>
  <li>he abides.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Poet</li>
  <li>What's to be thought of him? does the rumour hold</li>
  <li>for true, that he's so full of gold?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Painter</li>
  <li class="number">Certain: Alcibiades reports it; Phrynia and</li>
  <li>Timandra had gold of him: he likewise enriched poor</li>
  <li>straggling soldiers with great quantity: 'tis said</li>
  <li>he gave unto his steward a mighty sum.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Poet</li>
  <li>Then this breaking of his has been but a try for his friends.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Painter</li>
  <li class="number">Nothing else: you shall see him a palm in Athens</li>
  <li>again, and flourish with the highest. Therefore</li>
  <li>'tis not amiss we tender our loves to him, in this</li>
  <li>supposed distress of his: it will show honestly in</li>
  <li>us; and is very likely to load our purposes with</li>
  <li class="number">what they travail for, if it be a just true report</li>
  <li>that goes of his having.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Poet</li>
  <li>What have you now to present unto him?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Painter</li>
  <li>Nothing at this time but my visitation: only I will</li>
  <li>promise him an excellent piece.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Poet</li>
  <li class="number">I must serve him so too, tell him of an intent</li>
  <li>that's coming toward him.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Painter</li>
  <li>Good as the best. Promising is the very air o' the</li>
  <li>time: it opens the eyes of expectation:</li>
  <li>performance is ever the duller for his act; and,</li>
  <li class="number">but in the plainer and simpler kind of people, the</li>
  <li>deed of saying is quite out of use. To promise is</li>
  <li>most courtly and fashionable: performance is a kind</li>
  <li>of will or testament which argues a great sickness</li>
  <li>in his judgment that makes it.</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Poet</li>
  <li>I am thinking what I shall say I have provided for</li>
  <li>him: it must be a personating of himself; a satire</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TIMON</li>
  <li>Aside  Must thou needs stand for a villain in</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Poet</li>
  <li>Nay, let's seek him:</li>

  <li class="speaker">TIMON</li>
  <li class="number">Aside  I'll meet you at the turn. What a</li>
  <li>god's gold,</li>
  <li>That he is worshipp'd in a baser temple</li>
  <li>Than where swine feed!</li>
  <li>'Tis thou that rigg'st the bark and plough'st the foam,</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TIMON</li>
  <li>Have I once lived to see two honest men?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Poet</li>
  <li>Sir,</li>
  <li>Having often of your open bounty tasted,</li>
  <li>Hearing you were retired, your friends fall'n off,</li>
  <li class="number">Whose thankless natures — O abhorred spirits! — </li>
  <li>Not all the whips of heaven are large enough:</li>
  <li>What! to you,</li>
  <li>Whose star-like nobleness gave life and influence</li>
  <li>To their whole being! I am rapt and cannot cover</li>
  <li class="number">The monstrous bulk of this ingratitude</li>
  <li>With any size of words.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TIMON</li>
  <li>Let it go naked, men may see't the better:</li>
  <li>You that are honest, by being what you are,</li>
  <li>Make them best seen and known.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Painter</li>
  <li class="number">He and myself</li>
  <li>Have travail'd in the great shower of your gifts,</li>
  <li>And sweetly felt it.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TIMON</li>
  <li>Ay, you are honest men.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Painter</li>
  <li>We are hither come to offer you our service.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TIMON</li>
  <li class="number">Most honest men! Why, how shall I requite you?</li>
  <li>Can you eat roots, and drink cold water? no.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Both</li>
  <li>What we can do, we'll do, to do you service.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TIMON</li>
  <li>Ye're honest men: ye've heard that I have gold;</li>
  <li>I am sure you have: speak truth; ye're honest men.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Painter</li>
  <li class="number">So it is said, my noble lord; but therefore</li>
  <li>Came not my friend nor I.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TIMON</li>
  <li>Good honest men! Thou draw'st a counterfeit</li>
  <li>Best in all Athens: thou'rt, indeed, the best;</li>
  <li>Thou counterfeit'st most lively.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Painter</li>
  <li class="number">So, so, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TIMON</li>
  <li>E'en so, sir, as I say. And, for thy fiction,</li>
  <li>Why, thy verse swells with stuff so fine and smooth</li>
  <li>That thou art even natural in thine art.</li>
  <li>But, for all this, my honest-natured friends,</li>
  <li class="number">I must needs say you have a little fault:</li>
  <li>Marry, 'tis not monstrous in you, neither wish I</li>
  <li>You take much pains to mend.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Both</li>
  <li>Beseech your honour</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TIMON</li>
  <li>Will you, indeed?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Both</li>
  <li>Doubt it not, worthy lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TIMON</li>
  <li>There's never a one of you but trusts a knave,</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FLAVIUS</li>
  <li>It is in vain that you would speak with Timon;</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Senator</li>
  <li>Bring us to his cave:</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Senator</li>
  <li>At all times alike</li>

  <li>A lack of Timon's aid, hath sense withal</li>
  <li>Of its own fail, restraining aid to Timon;</li>
  <li>And send forth us, to make their sorrow'd render,</li>
  <li class="number">Together with a recompense more fruitful</li>
  <li>Than their offence can weigh down by the dram;</li>
  <li>Ay, even such heaps and sums of love and wealth</li>
  <li>As shall to thee blot out what wrongs were theirs</li>

  <li class="number">Therefore, Timon —  </li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TIMON</li>
  <li>Well, sir, I will; therefore, I will, sir; thus:</li>
  <li>If Alcibiades kill my countrymen,</li>
  <li>Let Alcibiades know this of Timon,</li>
  <li>That Timon cares not. But if be sack fair Athens,</li>
  <li class="number">And take our goodly aged men by the beards,</li>
  <li>Giving our holy virgins to the stain</li>
  <li>Of contumelious, beastly, mad-brain'd war,</li>
  <li>Then let him know, and tell him Timon speaks it,</li>
  <li>In pity of our aged and our youth,</li>
  <li class="number">I cannot choose but tell him, that I care not,</li>
  <li>And let him take't at worst; for their knives care not,</li>
  <li>While you have throats to answer: for myself,</li>
  <li>There's not a whittle in the unruly camp</li>
  <li>But I do prize it at my love before</li>
  <li class="number">The reverend'st throat in Athens. So I leave you</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TIMON</li>
  <li>Why, I was writing of my epitaph;</li>
  <li class="number">it will be seen to-morrow: my long sickness</li>

  <li>And nothing brings me all things. Go, live still;</li>

  <li class="stage-direction">Enter Senators on the walls</li>
  <li>Till now you have gone on and fill'd the time</li>
  <li>With all licentious measure, making your wills</li>
  <li class="number">The scope of justice; till now myself and such</li>
  <li>As slept within the shadow of your power</li>
  <li>Have wander'd with our traversed arms and breathed</li>
  <li>Our sufferance vainly: now the time is flush,</li>
  <li>When crouching marrow in the bearer strong</li>
  <li class="number">Cries of itself 'No more:' now breathless wrong</li>
  <li>Shall sit and pant in your great chairs of ease,</li>
  <li>And pursy insolence shall break his wind</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Senator</li>
  <li>Noble and young,</li>
  <li class="number">When thy first griefs were but a mere conceit,</li>
