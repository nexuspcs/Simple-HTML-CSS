<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SUFFOLK</li>
  <li>As by your high imperial majesty</li>
  <li>I had in charge at my depart for France,</li>
  <li>As procurator to your excellence,</li>
  <li>To marry Princess Margaret for your grace,</li>
  <li class="number">So, in the famous ancient city, Tours,</li>
  <li>In presence of the Kings of France and Sicil,</li>
  <li>The Dukes of Orleans, Calaber, Bretagne and Alencon,</li>
  <li>Seven earls, twelve barons and twenty reverend bishops,</li>
  <li>I have perform'd my task and was espoused:</li>
  <li class="number">And humbly now upon my bended knee,</li>
  <li>In sight of England and her lordly peers,</li>
  <li>Deliver up my title in the queen</li>
  <li>To your most gracious hands, that are the substance</li>
  <li>Of that great shadow I did represent;</li>
  <li class="number">The happiest gift that ever marquess gave,</li>
  <li>The fairest queen that ever king received.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING HENRY VI</li>
  <li>Suffolk, arise. Welcome, Queen Margaret:</li>
  <li>I can express no kinder sign of love</li>
  <li>Than this kind kiss. O Lord, that lends me life,</li>
  <li class="number">Lend me a heart replete with thankfulness!</li>
  <li>For thou hast given me in this beauteous face</li>

  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>

  <li>We here discharge your grace from being regent</li>

  <li>We thank you all for the great favour done,</li>
  <li>In entertainment to my princely queen.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li class="number">Brave peers of England, pillars of the state,</li>
  <li>To you Duke Humphrey must unload his grief,</li>
  <li>Your grief, the common grief of all the land.</li>
  <li>What! did my brother Henry spend his youth,</li>
  <li>His valour, coin and people, in the wars?</li>
  <li class="number">Did he so often lodge in open field,</li>
  <li>In winter's cold and summer's parching heat,</li>
  <li>To conquer France, his true inheritance?</li>
  <li>And did my brother Bedford toil his wits,</li>
  <li>To keep by policy what Henry got?</li>
  <li class="number">Have you yourselves, Somerset, Buckingham,</li>
  <li>Brave York, Salisbury, and victorious Warwick,</li>
  <li>Received deep scars in France and Normandy?</li>
  <li>Or hath mine uncle Beaufort and myself,</li>
  <li>With all the learned council of the realm,</li>
  <li class="number">Studied so long, sat in the council-house</li>
  <li>Early and late, debating to and fro</li>
  <li>How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe,</li>
  <li>And had his highness in his infancy</li>
  <li>Crowned in Paris in despite of foes?</li>
  <li class="number">And shall these labours and these honours die?</li>
  <li>Shall Henry's conquest, Bedford's vigilance,</li>
  <li>Your deeds of war and all our counsel die?</li>
  <li>O peers of England, shameful is this league!</li>
  <li>Fatal this marriage, cancelling your fame,</li>
  <li class="number">Blotting your names from books of memory,</li>
  <li>Razing the characters of your renown,</li>
  <li>Defacing monuments of conquer'd France,</li>
  <li>Undoing all, as all had never been!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CARDINAL</li>
  <li>Nephew, what means this passionate discourse,</li>
  <li class="number">This peroration with such circumstance?</li>
  <li>For France, 'tis ours; and we will keep it still.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>Ay, uncle, we will keep it, if we can;</li>
  <li>But now it is impossible we should:</li>
  <li>Suffolk, the new-made duke that rules the roast,</li>
  <li class="number">Hath given the duchy of Anjou and Maine</li>
  <li>Unto the poor King Reignier, whose large style</li>
  <li>Agrees not with the leanness of his purse.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SALISBURY</li>
  <li>Now, by the death of Him that died for all,</li>
  <li>These counties were the keys of Normandy.</li>
  <li class="number">But wherefore weeps Warwick, my valiant son?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WARWICK</li>
  <li>For grief that they are past recovery:</li>
  <li>For, were there hope to conquer them again,</li>
  <li>My sword should shed hot blood, mine eyes no tears.</li>
  <li>Anjou and Maine! myself did win them both;</li>
  <li class="number">Those provinces these arms of mine did conquer:</li>
  <li>And are the cities, that I got with wounds,</li>
  <li>Delivered up again with peaceful words?</li>
  <li>Mort Dieu!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">YORK</li>
  <li>For Suffolk's duke, may he be suffocate,</li>
  <li class="number">That dims the honour of this warlike isle!</li>
  <li>France should have torn and rent my very heart,</li>
  <li>Before I would have yielded to this league.</li>
  <li>I never read but England's kings have had</li>
  <li>Large sums of gold and dowries with their wives:</li>
  <li class="number">And our King Henry gives away his own,</li>
  <li>To match with her that brings no vantages.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>A proper jest, and never heard before,</li>
  <li>That Suffolk should demand a whole fifteenth</li>
  <li>For costs and charges in transporting her!</li>
  <li class="number">She should have stayed in France and starved</li>
  <li>in France, Before — </li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CARDINAL</li>
  <li>My Lord of Gloucester, now ye grow too hot:</li>
  <li>It was the pleasure of my lord the King.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>My Lord of Winchester, I know your mind;</li>
  <li class="number">'Tis not my speeches that you do mislike,</li>
  <li>But 'tis my presence that doth trouble ye.</li>
  <li>Rancour will out: proud prelate, in thy face</li>
  <li>I see thy fury: if I longer stay,</li>
  <li>We shall begin our ancient bickerings.</li>
  <li class="number">Lordings, farewell; and say, when I am gone,</li>
  <li>I prophesied France will be lost ere long.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CARDINAL</li>
  <li>So, there goes our protector in a rage.</li>
  <li>'Tis known to you he is mine enemy,</li>
  <li>Nay, more, an enemy unto you all,</li>
  <li class="number">And no great friend, I fear me, to the king.</li>
  <li>Consider, lords, he is the next of blood,</li>
  <li>And heir apparent to the English crown:</li>
  <li>Had Henry got an empire by his marriage,</li>
  <li>And all the wealthy kingdoms of the west,</li>
  <li class="number">There's reason he should be displeased at it.</li>
  <li>Look to it, lords! let not his smoothing words</li>
  <li>Bewitch your hearts; be wise and circumspect.</li>
  <li>What though the common people favour him,</li>
  <li>Calling him 'Humphrey, the good Duke of</li>
  <li class="number">Gloucester,'</li>
  <li>Clapping their hands, and crying with loud voice,</li>
  <li>'Jesu maintain your royal excellence!'</li>
  <li>With 'God preserve the good Duke Humphrey!'</li>
  <li>I fear me, lords, for all this flattering gloss,</li>
  <li class="number">He will be found a dangerous protector.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</li>
  <li>Why should he, then, protect our sovereign,</li>
  <li>He being of age to govern of himself?</li>
  <li>Cousin of Somerset, join you with me,</li>
  <li>And all together, with the Duke of Suffolk,</li>
  <li class="number">We'll quickly hoise Duke Humphrey from his seat.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CARDINAL</li>
  <li>This weighty business will not brook delay:</li>
  <li>I'll to the Duke of Suffolk presently.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SOMERSET</li>
  <li>Cousin of Buckingham, though Humphrey's pride</li>
  <li>And greatness of his place be grief to us,</li>
  <li class="number">Yet let us watch the haughty cardinal:</li>
  <li>His insolence is more intolerable</li>
  <li>Than all the princes in the land beside:</li>
  <li>If Gloucester be displaced, he'll be protector.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</li>
  <li>Or thou or I, Somerset, will be protector,</li>
  <li class="number">Despite Duke Humphrey or the cardinal.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt BUCKINGHAM and SOMERSET</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SALISBURY</li>
  <li>Pride went before, ambition follows him.</li>
  <li>While these do labour for their own preferment,</li>
  <li>Behoves it us to labour for the realm.</li>
  <li>I never saw but Humphrey Duke of Gloucester</li>
  <li class="number">Did bear him like a noble gentleman.</li>
  <li>Oft have I seen the haughty cardinal,</li>
  <li>More like a soldier than a man o' the church,</li>
  <li>As stout and proud as he were lord of all,</li>
  <li>Swear like a ruffian and demean himself</li>
  <li class="number">Unlike the ruler of a commonweal.</li>
  <li>Warwick, my son, the comfort of my age,</li>
  <li>Thy deeds, thy plainness and thy housekeeping,</li>
  <li>Hath won the greatest favour of the commons,</li>
  <li>Excepting none but good Duke Humphrey:</li>
  <li class="number">And, brother York, thy acts in Ireland,</li>
  <li>In bringing them to civil discipline,</li>
  <li>Thy late exploits done in the heart of France,</li>
  <li>When thou wert regent for our sovereign,</li>
  <li>Have made thee fear'd and honour'd of the people:</li>
  <li class="number">Join we together, for the public good,</li>
  <li>In what we can, to bridle and suppress</li>
  <li>The pride of Suffolk and the cardinal,</li>
  <li>With Somerset's and Buckingham's ambition;</li>
  <li>And, as we may, cherish Duke Humphrey's deeds,</li>
  <li class="number">While they do tend the profit of the land.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WARWICK</li>
  <li>So God help Warwick, as he loves the land,</li>
  <li>And common profit of his country!</li>

  <li class="speaker">YORK</li>
  <li>Aside  And so says York, for he hath greatest cause.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SALISBURY</li>
  <li>Then let's make haste away, and look unto the main.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WARWICK</li>
  <li class="number">Unto the main! O father, Maine is lost;</li>
  <li>That Maine which by main force Warwick did win,</li>
  <li>And would have kept so long as breath did last!</li>
  <li>Main chance, father, you meant; but I meant Maine,</li>
  <li>Which I will win from France, or else be slain,</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt WARWICK and SALISBURY</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">YORK</li>
  <li class="number">Anjou and Maine are given to the French;</li>
  <li>Paris is lost; the state of Normandy</li>
  <li>Stands on a tickle point, now they are gone:</li>
  <li>Suffolk concluded on the articles,</li>
  <li>The peers agreed, and Henry was well pleased</li>
  <li class="number">To change two dukedoms for a duke's fair daughter.</li>
  <li>I cannot blame them all: what is't to them?</li>
  <li>'Tis thine they give away, and not their own.</li>
  <li>Pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage</li>
  <li>And purchase friends and give to courtezans,</li>
  <li class="number">Still revelling like lords till all be gone;</li>
  <li>While as the silly owner of the goods</li>
  <li>Weeps over them and wrings his hapless hands</li>
  <li>And shakes his head and trembling stands aloof,</li>
  <li>While all is shared and all is borne away,</li>
  <li class="number">Ready to starve and dare not touch his own:</li>
  <li>So York must sit and fret and bite his tongue,</li>
  <li>While his own lands are bargain'd for and sold.</li>
  <li>Methinks the realms of England, France and Ireland</li>
  <li>Bear that proportion to my flesh and blood</li>
  <li class="number">As did the fatal brand Althaea burn'd</li>
  <li>Unto the prince's heart of Calydon.</li>
  <li>Anjou and Maine both given unto the French!</li>
  <li>Cold news for me, for I had hope of France,</li>
  <li>Even as I have of fertile England's soil.</li>
  <li class="number">A day will come when York shall claim his own;</li>
  <li>And therefore I will take the Nevils' parts</li>
  <li>And make a show of love to proud Duke Humphrey,</li>
  <li>And, when I spy advantage, claim the crown,</li>
  <li>For that's the golden mark I seek to hit:</li>
  <li class="number">Nor shall proud Lancaster usurp my right,</li>
  <li>Nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist,</li>
  <li>Nor wear the diadem upon his head,</li>
  <li>Whose church-like humours fits not for a crown.</li>
  <li>Then, York, be still awhile, till time do serve:</li>
  <li class="number">Watch thou and wake when others be asleep,</li>
  <li>To pry into the secrets of the state;</li>
  <li>Till Henry, surfeiting in joys of love,</li>
  <li>With his new bride and England's dear-bought queen,</li>
  <li>And Humphrey with the peers be fall'n at jars:</li>
  <li class="number">Then will I raise aloft the milk-white rose,</li>
  <li>With whose sweet smell the air shall be perfumed;</li>
  <li>And in my standard bear the arms of York</li>
  <li>To grapple with the house of Lancaster;</li>
  <li>And, force perforce, I'll make him yield the crown,</li>

<h3>SCENE II.  London. YORK'S garden.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter YORK, SALISBURY, and WARWICK</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">YORK</li>
  <li>Now, my good Lords of Salisbury and Warwick,</li>
  <li>Our simple supper ended, give me leave</li>
  <li>In this close walk to satisfy myself,</li>
  <li>In craving your opinion of my title,</li>
  <li class="number">Which is infallible, to England's crown.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SALISBURY</li>
  <li>My lord, I long to hear it at full.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WARWICK</li>
  <li>Sweet York, begin: and if thy claim be good,</li>
  <li>The Nevils are thy subjects to command.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">YORK</li>
  <li>Then thus:</li>
  <li class="number">Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons:</li>
  <li>The first, Edward the Black Prince, Prince of Wales;</li>
  <li>The second, William of Hatfield, and the third,</li>
  <li>Lionel Duke of Clarence: next to whom</li>
  <li>Was John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster;</li>
  <li class="number">The fifth was Edmund Langley, Duke of York;</li>
  <li>The sixth was Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester;</li>
  <li>William of Windsor was the seventh and last.</li>
  <li>Edward the Black Prince died before his father</li>
  <li>And left behind him Richard, his only son,</li>
  <li class="number">Who after Edward the Third's death reign'd as king;</li>
  <li>Till Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Lancaster,</li>
  <li>The eldest son and heir of John of Gaunt,</li>
  <li>Crown'd by the name of Henry the Fourth,</li>
  <li>Seized on the realm, deposed the rightful king,</li>
  <li class="number">Sent his poor queen to France, from whence she came,</li>
  <li>And him to Pomfret; where, as all you know,</li>
  <li>Harmless Richard was murder'd traitorously.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WARWICK</li>
  <li>Father, the duke hath told the truth:</li>
  <li>Thus got the house of Lancaster the crown.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">YORK</li>
  <li class="number">Which now they hold by force and not by right;</li>
  <li>For Richard, the first son's heir, being dead,</li>
  <li>The issue of the next son should have reign'd.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SALISBURY</li>
  <li>But William of Hatfield died without an heir.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">YORK</li>
  <li>The third son, Duke of Clarence, from whose line</li>
  <li class="number">I claimed the crown, had issue, Philippe, a daughter,</li>
  <li>Who married Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March:</li>
  <li>Edmund had issue, Roger Earl of March;</li>
  <li>Roger had issue, Edmund, Anne and Eleanor.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SALISBURY</li>
  <li>This Edmund, in the reign of Bolingbroke,</li>
  <li class="number">As I have read, laid claim unto the crown;</li>
  <li>And, but for Owen Glendower, had been king,</li>
  <li>Who kept him in captivity till he died.</li>
  <li>But to the rest.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">YORK</li>
  <li>His eldest sister, Anne,</li>
  <li class="number">My mother, being heir unto the crown</li>
  <li>Married Richard Earl of Cambridge; who was son</li>
  <li>To Edmund Langley, Edward the Third's fifth son.</li>
  <li>By her I claim the kingdom: she was heir</li>
  <li>To Roger Earl of March, who was the son</li>
  <li class="number">Of Edmund Mortimer, who married Philippe,</li>
  <li>Sole daughter unto Lionel Duke of Clarence:</li>
  <li>So, if the issue of the elder son</li>
  <li>Succeed before the younger, I am king.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WARWICK</li>
  <li>What plain proceeding is more plain than this?</li>
  <li class="number">Henry doth claim the crown from John of Gaunt,</li>
  <li>The fourth son; York claims it from the third.</li>
  <li>Till Lionel's issue fails, his should not reign:</li>
  <li>It fails not yet, but flourishes in thee</li>
  <li>And in thy sons, fair slips of such a stock.</li>
  <li class="number">Then, father Salisbury, kneel we together;</li>
  <li>And in this private plot be we the first</li>
  <li>That shall salute our rightful sovereign</li>
  <li>With honour of his birthright to the crown.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BOTH</li>
  <li>Long live our sovereign Richard, England's king!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">YORK</li>
  <li class="number">We thank you, lords. But I am not your king</li>
  <li>Till I be crown'd and that my sword be stain'd</li>
  <li>With heart-blood of the house of Lancaster;</li>
  <li>And that's not suddenly to be perform'd,</li>
  <li>But with advice and silent secrecy.</li>
  <li class="number">Do you as I do in these dangerous days:</li>
  <li>Wink at the Duke of Suffolk's insolence,</li>
  <li>At Beaufort's pride, at Somerset's ambition,</li>
  <li>At Buckingham and all the crew of them,</li>
  <li>Till they have snared the shepherd of the flock,</li>
  <li class="number">That virtuous prince, the good Duke Humphrey:</li>
  <li>'Tis that they seek, and they in seeking that</li>
  <li>Shall find their deaths, if York can prophesy.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SALISBURY</li>
  <li>My lord, break we off; we know your mind at full.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WARWICK</li>
  <li>My heart assures me that the Earl of Warwick</li>
  <li class="number">Shall one day make the Duke of York a king.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">YORK</li>
  <li>And, Nevil, this I do assure myself:</li>

<h3>SCENE I.  The Abbey at Bury St. Edmund's.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Sound a sennet. Enter KING HENRY VI, QUEEN
MARGARET, CARDINAL, SUFFOLK, YORK, BUCKINGHAM,
SALISBURY and WARWICK to the Parliament</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING HENRY VI</li>
  <li>I muse my Lord of Gloucester is not come:</li>
  <li>'Tis not his wont to be the hindmost man,</li>
  <li>Whate'er occasion keeps him from us now.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">QUEEN MARGARET</li>
  <li>Can you not see? or will ye not observe</li>
  <li class="number">The strangeness of his alter'd countenance?</li>
  <li>With what a majesty he bears himself,</li>
  <li>How insolent of late he is become,</li>
  <li>How proud, how peremptory, and unlike himself?</li>
  <li>We know the time since he was mild and affable,</li>
  <li class="number">And if we did but glance a far-off look,</li>
  <li>Immediately he was upon his knee,</li>
  <li>That all the court admired him for submission:</li>
  <li>But meet him now, and, be it in the morn,</li>
  <li>When every one will give the time of day,</li>
  <li class="number">He knits his brow and shows an angry eye,</li>
  <li>And passeth by with stiff unbowed knee,</li>
  <li>Disdaining duty that to us belongs.</li>
  <li>Small curs are not regarded when they grin;</li>
  <li>But great men tremble when the lion roars;</li>
  <li class="number">And Humphrey is no little man in England.</li>
  <li>First note that he is near you in descent,</li>
  <li>And should you fall, he as the next will mount.</li>
  <li>Me seemeth then it is no policy,</li>
  <li>Respecting what a rancorous mind he bears</li>
  <li class="number">And his advantage following your decease,</li>
  <li>That he should come about your royal person</li>
  <li>Or be admitted to your highness' council.</li>
  <li>By flattery hath he won the commons' hearts,</li>
  <li>And when he please to make commotion,</li>
  <li class="number">'Tis to be fear'd they all will follow him.</li>
  <li>Now 'tis the spring, and weeds are shallow-rooted;</li>
  <li>Suffer them now, and they'll o'ergrow the garden</li>
  <li>And choke the herbs for want of husbandry.</li>
  <li>The reverent care I bear unto my lord</li>
  <li class="number">Made me collect these dangers in the duke.</li>
  <li>If it be fond, call it a woman's fear;</li>
  <li>Which fear if better reasons can supplant,</li>
  <li>I will subscribe and say I wrong'd the duke.</li>
  <li>My Lord of Suffolk, Buckingham, and York,</li>
  <li class="number">Reprove my allegation, if you can;</li>
  <li>Or else conclude my words effectual.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SUFFOLK</li>
  <li>Well hath your highness seen into this duke;</li>
  <li>And, had I first been put to speak my mind,</li>
  <li>I think I should have told your grace's tale.</li>
  <li class="number">The duchess, by his subornation,</li>
  <li>Upon my life, began her devilish practises:</li>
  <li>Or, if he were not privy to those faults,</li>
  <li>Yet, by reputing of his high descent,</li>
  <li>As next the king he was successive heir,</li>
  <li class="number">And such high vaunts of his nobility,</li>
  <li>Did instigate the bedlam brain-sick duchess</li>
  <li>By wicked means to frame our sovereign's fall.</li>
  <li>Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep;</li>
  <li>And in his simple show he harbours treason.</li>
  <li class="number">The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb.</li>
  <li>No, no, my sovereign; Gloucester is a man</li>
  <li>Unsounded yet and full of deep deceit.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CARDINAL</li>
  <li>Did he not, contrary to form of law,</li>
  <li>Devise strange deaths for small offences done?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">YORK</li>
  <li class="number">And did he not, in his protectorship,</li>
  <li>Levy great sums of money through the realm</li>
  <li>For soldiers' pay in France, and never sent it?</li>
  <li>By means whereof the towns each day revolted.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</li>
  <li>Tut, these are petty faults to faults unknown.</li>
  <li class="number">Which time will bring to light in smooth</li>
  <li>Duke Humphrey.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING HENRY VI</li>
  <li>My lords, at once: the care you have of us,</li>
  <li>To mow down thorns that would annoy our foot,</li>
  <li>Is worthy praise: but, shall I speak my conscience,</li>
  <li class="number">Our kinsman Gloucester is as innocent</li>
  <li>From meaning treason to our royal person</li>
  <li>As is the sucking lamb or harmless dove:</li>
  <li>The duke is virtuous, mild and too well given</li>
  <li>To dream on evil or to work my downfall.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">QUEEN MARGARET</li>
  <li class="number">Ah, what's more dangerous than this fond affiance!</li>
  <li>Seems he a dove? his feathers are but borrowed,</li>
  <li>For he's disposed as the hateful raven:</li>
  <li>Is he a lamb? his skin is surely lent him,</li>
  <li>For he's inclined as is the ravenous wolf.</li>
  <li class="number">Who cannot steal a shape that means deceit?</li>
  <li>Take heed, my lord; the welfare of us all</li>
  <li>Hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man.</li>

  <li>As firmly as I hope for fertile England.</li>

  <li>Nay, Gloucester, know that thou art come too soon,</li>
  <li>Unless thou wert more loyal than thou art:</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>Well, Suffolk, thou shalt not see me blush</li>

  <li>A heart unspotted is not easily daunted.</li>
  <li>The purest spring is not so free from mud</li>

  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>Is it but thought so? what are they that think it?</li>
  <li>I never robb'd the soldiers of their pay,</li>

  <li>So help me God, as I have watch'd the night,</li>
  <li>Ay, night by night, in studying good for England,</li>
  <li>That doit that e'er I wrested from the king,</li>
  <li>Or any groat I hoarded to my use,</li>

  <li>I say no more than truth, so help me God!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">YORK</li>
  <li>In your protectorship you did devise</li>
  <li>Strange tortures for offenders never heard of,</li>
  <li>That England was defamed by tyranny.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li class="number">Why, 'tis well known that, whiles I was</li>
  <li>protector,</li>
  <li>Pity was all the fault that was in me;</li>
  <li>For I should melt at an offender's tears,</li>
  <li>And lowly words were ransom for their fault.</li>
  <li class="number">Unless it were a bloody murderer,</li>
  <li>Or foul felonious thief that fleeced poor passengers,</li>
  <li>I never gave them condign punishment:</li>
  <li>Murder indeed, that bloody sin, I tortured</li>
  <li>Above the felon or what trespass else.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SUFFOLK</li>
  <li class="number">My lord, these faults are easy, quickly answered:</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING HENRY VI</li>
  <li>My lord of Gloucester, 'tis my special hope</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>Ah, gracious lord, these days are dangerous:</li>
  <li class="number">Virtue is choked with foul ambition</li>
  <li>And charity chased hence by rancour's hand;</li>
  <li>Foul subornation is predominant</li>
  <li>And equity exiled your highness' land.</li>
  <li>I know their complot is to have my life,</li>
  <li class="number">And if my death might make this island happy,</li>
  <li>And prove the period of their tyranny,</li>
  <li>I would expend it with all willingness:</li>
  <li>But mine is made the prologue to their play;</li>
  <li>For thousands more, that yet suspect no peril,</li>
  <li class="number">Will not conclude their plotted tragedy.</li>
  <li>Beaufort's red sparkling eyes blab his heart's malice,</li>
  <li>And Suffolk's cloudy brow his stormy hate;</li>
  <li>Sharp Buckingham unburthens with his tongue</li>
  <li>The envious load that lies upon his heart;</li>
  <li class="number">And dogged York, that reaches at the moon,</li>
  <li>Whose overweening arm I have pluck'd back,</li>
  <li>By false accuse doth level at my life:</li>
  <li>And you, my sovereign lady, with the rest,</li>
  <li>Causeless have laid disgraces on my head,</li>
  <li class="number">And with your best endeavour have stirr'd up</li>
  <li>My liefest liege to be mine enemy:</li>
  <li>Ay, all you have laid your heads together — </li>
  <li>Myself had notice of your conventicles — </li>
  <li>And all to make away my guiltless life.</li>
  <li class="number">I shall not want false witness to condemn me,</li>
  <li>Nor store of treasons to augment my guilt;</li>
  <li>The ancient proverb will be well effected:</li>
  <li>'A staff is quickly found to beat a dog.'</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CARDINAL</li>
  <li>My liege, his railing is intolerable:</li>

  <li>From treason's secret knife and traitors' rage</li>
  <li>Be thus upbraided, chid and rated at,</li>
  <li>And the offender granted scope of speech,</li>

  <li>Resign to death; it is not worth the enjoying:</li>

  <li>Well, nobles, well, 'tis politicly done,</li>
  <li class="number">To send me packing with an host of men:</li>

  <li>You put sharp weapons in a madman's hands.</li>
  <li>Whiles I in Ireland nourish a mighty band,</li>
  <li>I will stir up in England some black storm</li>
  <li>Shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell;</li>
  <li class="number">And this fell tempest shall not cease to rage</li>
  <li>Until the golden circuit on my head,</li>
  <li>Like to the glorious sun's transparent beams,</li>
  <li>Do calm the fury of this mad-bred flaw.</li>
  <li>And, for a minister of my intent,</li>
  <li class="number">I have seduced a headstrong Kentishman,</li>
  <li>John Cade of Ashford,</li>
  <li>To make commotion, as full well he can,</li>
  <li>Under the title of John Mortimer.</li>
  <li>In Ireland have I seen this stubborn Cade</li>
  <li class="number">Oppose himself against a troop of kerns,</li>
  <li>And fought so long, till that his thighs with darts</li>
  <li>Were almost like a sharp-quill'd porpentine;</li>
  <li>And, in the end being rescued, I have seen</li>
  <li>Him caper upright like a wild Morisco,</li>
  <li class="number">Shaking the bloody darts as he his bells.</li>
  <li>Full often, like a shag-hair'd crafty kern,</li>
  <li>Hath he conversed with the enemy,</li>
  <li>And undiscover'd come to me again</li>
  <li>And given me notice of their villanies.</li>
  <li class="number">This devil here shall be my substitute;</li>
  <li>For that John Mortimer, which now is dead,</li>
  <li>In face, in gait, in speech, he doth resemble:</li>
  <li>By this I shall perceive the commons' mind,</li>
  <li>How they affect the house and claim of York.</li>
  <li class="number">Say he be taken, rack'd and tortured,</li>
  <li>I know no pain they can inflict upon him</li>
  <li>Will make him say I moved him to those arms.</li>
  <li>Say that he thrive, as 'tis great like he will,</li>
  <li>Why, then from Ireland come I with my strength</li>
  <li class="number">And reap the harvest which that rascal sow'd;</li>
  <li>For Humphrey being dead, as he shall be,</li>
  <li>And Henry put apart, the next for me.</li>

  <li>I stood upon the hatches in the storm,</li>
  <li class="number">And when the dusky sky began to rob</li>

  <li>As being thought to contradict your liking,</li>
  <li class="number">Makes them thus forward in his banishment.</li>
  <li>They say, in care of your most royal person,</li>

  <li>In pain of your dislike or pain of death,</li>

  <li>Ay, every joint should seem to curse and ban:</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SUFFOLK</li>

  <li>Now, by the ground that I am banish'd from,</li>

  <li>'Tis not the land I care for, wert thou thence;</li>
  <li>A wilderness is populous enough,</li>

  <li>If I depart from thee, I cannot live;</li>

  <li>Here could I breathe my soul into the air,</li>
  <li class="number">As mild and gentle as the cradle-babe</li>
  <li>Dying with mother's dug between its lips:</li>
  <li>Where, from thy sight, I should be raging mad,</li>
  <li>And cry out for thee to close up mine eyes,</li>
  <li>To have thee with thy lips to stop my mouth;</li>
  <li class="number">So shouldst thou either turn my flying soul,</li>
  <li>Or I should breathe it so into thy body,</li>
  <li>And then it lived in sweet Elysium.</li>
  <li>To die by thee were but to die in jest;</li>
  <li>From thee to die were torture more than death:</li>

  <li class="number">Who, with their drowsy, slow and flagging wings,</li>
  <li>Clip dead men's graves and from their misty jaws</li>
  <li>Breathe foul contagious darkness in the air.</li>
  <li>Therefore bring forth the soldiers of our prize;</li>
  <li>For, whilst our pinnace anchors in the Downs,</li>
  <li class="number">Here shall they make their ransom on the sand,</li>
  <li>Or with their blood stain this discolour'd shore.</li>
  <li>Master, this prisoner freely give I thee;</li>
  <li>And thou that art his mate, make boot of this;</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Captain</li>
  <li>What, think you much to pay two thousand crowns,</li>
  <li>And bear the name and port of gentlemen?</li>
  <li class="number">Cut both the villains' throats; for die you shall:</li>
  <li>The lives of those which we have lost in fight</li>
  <li>Be counterpoised with such a petty sum!</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SUFFOLK</li>
  <li>Thy name affrights me, in whose sound is death.</li>

  <li class="speaker">WHITMORE</li>
  <li>Gaultier or Walter, which it is, I care not:</li>

  <li>Therefore, when merchant-like I sell revenge,</li>

  <li>The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers.</li>

<ol class="speech">

  <li>Nay, that I mean to do. Is not this a lamentable</li>
  <li class="number">thing, that of the skin of an innocent lamb should</li>
  <li>be made parchment? that parchment, being scribbled</li>
  <li>o'er, should undo a man? Some say the bee stings:</li>
  <li>but I say, 'tis the bee's wax; for I did but seal</li>
  <li>once to a thing, and I was never mine own man</li>

  <li>That's false.</li>

  <li>Ay, there's the question; but I say, 'tis true:</li>

  <li>My heart is turn'd to stone: and while 'tis mine,</li>

  <li>Into as many gobbets will I cut it</li>
  <li class="number">As wild Medea young Absyrtus did:</li>
  <li>In cruelty will I seek out my fame.</li>
