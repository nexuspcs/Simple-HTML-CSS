<h3>SCENE I.  London. The Parliament-house.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Alarum. Enter YORK, EDWARD, RICHARD, NORFOLK, MONTAGUE, WARWICK, and Soldiers</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WARWICK</li>
  <li>I wonder how the king escaped our hands.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">YORK</li>
  <li>While we pursued the horsemen of the north,</li>
  <li>He slily stole away and left his men:</li>
  <li>Whereat the great Lord of Northumberland,</li>
  <li class="number">Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat,</li>
  <li>Cheer'd up the drooping army; and himself,</li>
  <li>Lord Clifford and Lord Stafford, all abreast,</li>
  <li>Charged our main battle's front, and breaking in</li>
  <li>Were by the swords of common soldiers slain.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EDWARD</li>
  <li class="number">Lord Stafford's father, Duke of Buckingham,</li>
  <li>Is either slain or wounded dangerously;</li>
  <li>I cleft his beaver with a downright blow:</li>
  <li>That this is true, father, behold his blood.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MONTAGUE</li>
  <li>And, brother, here's the Earl of Wiltshire's blood,</li>
  <li class="number">Whom I encounter'd as the battles join'd.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">RICHARD</li>
  <li>Speak thou for me and tell them what I did.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Throwing down SOMERSET's head</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">YORK</li>
  <li>Richard hath best deserved of all my sons.</li>
  <li>But is your grace dead, my Lord of Somerset?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NORFOLK</li>
  <li>Such hope have all the line of John of Gaunt!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">RICHARD</li>
  <li class="number">Thus do I hope to shake King Henry's head.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WARWICK</li>
  <li>And so do I. Victorious Prince of York,</li>
  <li>Before I see thee seated in that throne</li>
  <li>Which now the house of Lancaster usurps,</li>
  <li>I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close.</li>
  <li class="number">This is the palace of the fearful king,</li>
  <li>And this the regal seat: possess it, York;</li>
  <li>For this is thine and not King Henry's heirs'</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">YORK</li>
  <li>Assist me, then, sweet Warwick, and I will;</li>
  <li>For hither we have broken in by force.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NORFOLK</li>
  <li class="number">We'll all assist you; he that flies shall die.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">YORK</li>
  <li>Thanks, gentle Norfolk: stay by me, my lords;</li>
  <li>And, soldiers, stay and lodge by me this night.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">They go up</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WARWICK</li>
  <li>And when the king comes, offer no violence,</li>
  <li>Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">YORK</li>
  <li class="number">The queen this day here holds her parliament,</li>
  <li>But little thinks we shall be of her council:</li>
  <li>By words or blows here let us win our right.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">RICHARD</li>
  <li>Arm'd as we are, let's stay within this house.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WARWICK</li>
  <li>The bloody parliament shall this be call'd,</li>
  <li class="number">Unless Plantagenet, Duke of York, be king,</li>
  <li>And bashful Henry deposed, whose cowardice</li>
  <li>Hath made us by-words to our enemies.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">YORK</li>
  <li>Then leave me not, my lords; be resolute;</li>
  <li>I mean to take possession of my right.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WARWICK</li>
  <li class="number">Neither the king, nor he that loves him best,</li>
  <li>The proudest he that holds up Lancaster,</li>
  <li>Dares stir a wing, if Warwick shake his bells.</li>
  <li>I'll plant Plantagenet, root him up who dares:</li>
  <li>Resolve thee, Richard; claim the English crown.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VI, CLIFFORD,
NORTHUMBERLAND, WESTMORELAND, EXETER, and the rest</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING HENRY VI</li>
  <li class="number">My lords, look where the sturdy rebel sits,</li>
  <li>Even in the chair of state: belike he means,</li>
  <li>Back'd by the power of Warwick, that false peer,</li>
  <li>To aspire unto the crown and reign as king.</li>
  <li>Earl of Northumberland, he slew thy father.</li>
  <li class="number">And thine, Lord Clifford; and you both have vow'd revenge</li>
  <li>On him, his sons, his favourites and his friends.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NORTHUMBERLAND</li>
  <li>If I be not, heavens be revenged on me!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CLIFFORD</li>
  <li>The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WESTMORELAND</li>
  <li>What, shall we suffer this? let's pluck him down:</li>
  <li class="number">My heart for anger burns; I cannot brook it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING HENRY VI</li>
  <li>Be patient, gentle Earl of Westmoreland.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CLIFFORD</li>
  <li>Patience is for poltroons, such as he:</li>
  <li>He durst not sit there, had your father lived.</li>
  <li>My gracious lord, here in the parliament</li>
  <li class="number">Let us assail the family of York.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NORTHUMBERLAND</li>
  <li>Well hast thou spoken, cousin: be it so.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING HENRY VI</li>
  <li>Ah, know you not the city favours them,</li>
  <li>And they have troops of soldiers at their beck?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EXETER</li>
  <li>But when the duke is slain, they'll quickly fly.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING HENRY VI</li>
  <li class="number">Far be the thought of this from Henry's heart,</li>
  <li>To make a shambles of the parliament-house!</li>
  <li>Cousin of Exeter, frowns, words and threats</li>
  <li>Shall be the war that Henry means to use.</li>
  <li>Thou factious Duke of York, descend my throne,</li>
  <li class="number">and kneel for grace and mercy at my feet;</li>
  <li>I am thy sovereign.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">YORK</li>
  <li>I am thine.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EXETER</li>
  <li>For shame, come down: he made thee Duke of York.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">YORK</li>
  <li>'Twas my inheritance, as the earldom was.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EXETER</li>
  <li class="number">Thy father was a traitor to the crown.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WARWICK</li>
  <li>Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown</li>
  <li>In following this usurping Henry.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CLIFFORD</li>
  <li>Whom should he follow but his natural king?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WARWICK</li>
  <li>True, Clifford; and that's Richard Duke of York.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING HENRY VI</li>
  <li class="number">And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">YORK</li>
  <li>It must and shall be so: content thyself.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WARWICK</li>
  <li>Be Duke of Lancaster; let him be king.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WESTMORELAND</li>
  <li>He is both king and Duke of Lancaster;</li>
  <li>And that the Lord of Westmoreland shall maintain.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WARWICK</li>
  <li class="number">And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget</li>
  <li>That we are those which chased you from the field</li>
  <li>And slew your fathers, and with colours spread</li>
  <li>March'd through the city to the palace gates.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NORTHUMBERLAND</li>
  <li>Yes, Warwick, I remember it to my grief;</li>
  <li class="number">And, by his soul, thou and thy house shall rue it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WESTMORELAND</li>
  <li>Plantagenet, of thee and these thy sons,</li>
  <li>Thy kinsman and thy friends, I'll have more lives</li>
  <li>Than drops of blood were in my father's veins.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CLIFFORD</li>
  <li>Urge it no more; lest that, instead of words,</li>
  <li class="number">I send thee, Warwick, such a messenger</li>
  <li>As shall revenge his death before I stir.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WARWICK</li>
  <li>Poor Clifford! how I scorn his worthless threats!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">YORK</li>
  <li>Will you we show our title to the crown?</li>
  <li>If not, our swords shall plead it in the field.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING HENRY VI</li>
  <li class="number">What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?</li>
  <li>Thy father was, as thou art, Duke of York;</li>
  <li>Thy grandfather, Roger Mortimer, Earl of March:</li>
  <li>I am the son of Henry the Fifth,</li>
  <li>Who made the Dauphin and the French to stoop</li>
  <li class="number">And seized upon their towns and provinces.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WARWICK</li>
  <li>Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it all.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING HENRY VI</li>
  <li>The lord protector lost it, and not I:</li>
  <li>When I was crown'd I was but nine months old.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">RICHARD</li>
  <li>You are old enough now, and yet, methinks, you lose.</li>
  <li class="number">Father, tear the crown from the usurper's head.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EDWARD</li>
  <li>Sweet father, do so; set it on your head.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MONTAGUE</li>
  <li>Good brother, as thou lovest and honourest arms,</li>
  <li>Let's fight it out and not stand cavilling thus.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">RICHARD</li>
  <li>Sound drums and trumpets, and the king will fly.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">YORK</li>
  <li class="number">Sons, peace!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING HENRY VI</li>
  <li>Peace, thou! and give King Henry leave to speak.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WARWICK</li>
  <li>Plantagenet shall speak first: hear him, lords;</li>
  <li>And be you silent and attentive too,</li>
  <li>For he that interrupts him shall not live.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING HENRY VI</li>
  <li class="number">Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne,</li>
  <li>Wherein my grandsire and my father sat?</li>
  <li>No: first shall war unpeople this my realm;</li>
  <li>Ay, and their colours, often borne in France,</li>
  <li>And now in England to our heart's great sorrow,</li>
  <li class="number">Shall be my winding-sheet. Why faint you, lords?</li>
  <li>My title's good, and better far than his.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WARWICK</li>
  <li>Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be king.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING HENRY VI</li>
  <li>Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">YORK</li>
  <li>'Twas by rebellion against his king.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING HENRY VI</li>
  <li class="number">Aside  I know not what to say; my title's weak. â€” </li>
  <li>Tell me, may not a king adopt an heir?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">YORK</li>
  <li>What then?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING HENRY VI</li>
  <li>An if he may, then am I lawful king;</li>
  <li>For Richard, in the view of many lords,</li>
  <li class="number">Resign'd the crown to Henry the Fourth,</li>
  <li>Whose heir my father was, and I am his.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">YORK</li>
  <li>He rose against him, being his sovereign,</li>
  <li>And made him to resign his crown perforce.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WARWICK</li>
  <li>Suppose, my lords, he did it unconstrain'd,</li>
  <li class="number">Think you 'twere prejudicial to his crown?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EXETER</li>
  <li>No; for he could not so resign his crown</li>
  <li>But that the next heir should succeed and reign.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING HENRY VI</li>
  <li>Art thou against us, Duke of Exeter?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EXETER</li>
  <li>His is the right, and therefore pardon me.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">YORK</li>
  <li class="number">Why whisper you, my lords, and answer not?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EXETER</li>
  <li>My conscience tells me he is lawful king.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING HENRY VI</li>
  <li>Aside  All will revolt from me, and turn to him.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NORTHUMBERLAND</li>
  <li>Plantagenet, for all the claim thou lay'st,</li>
  <li>Think not that Henry shall be so deposed.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WARWICK</li>
  <li class="number">Deposed he shall be, in despite of all.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NORTHUMBERLAND</li>
  <li>Thou art deceived: 'tis not thy southern power,</li>
  <li>Of Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk, nor of Kent,</li>
  <li>Which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud,</li>
  <li>Can set the duke up in despite of me.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CLIFFORD</li>
  <li class="number">King Henry, be thy title right or wrong,</li>
  <li>Lord Clifford vows to fight in thy defence:</li>
  <li>May that ground gape and swallow me alive,</li>
  <li>Where I shall kneel to him that slew my father!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING HENRY VI</li>
  <li>O Clifford, how thy words revive my heart!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">YORK</li>
  <li class="number">Henry of Lancaster, resign thy crown.</li>
  <li>What mutter you, or what conspire you, lords?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WARWICK</li>
  <li>Do right unto this princely Duke of York,</li>
  <li>Or I will fill the house with armed men,</li>
  <li>And over the chair of state, where now he sits,</li>
  <li class="number">Write up his title with usurping blood.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">He stamps with his foot and the soldiers show
themselves</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING HENRY VI</li>
  <li>My Lord of Warwick, hear me but one word:</li>
  <li>Let me for this my life-time reign as king.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">YORK</li>
  <li>Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs,</li>
  <li>And thou shalt reign in quiet while thou livest.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING HENRY VI</li>
  <li class="number">I am content: Richard Plantagenet,</li>
  <li>Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.</li>

  <li>What wrong is this unto the prince your son!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WARWICK</li>
  <li>What good is this to England and himself!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">

<ol class="speech">

  <li>I cannot stay to hear these articles.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CLIFFORD</li>
  <li>Come, cousin, let us tell the queen these news.</li>

  <li>Farewell, faint-hearted and degenerate king,</li>

  <li>O, 'tis a fault too too unpardonable!</li>
  <li>Off with the crown, and with the crown his head;</li>

  <li class="speaker">YORK</li>
  <li>She-wolf of France, but worse than wolves of France,</li>
  <li>Whose tongue more poisons than the adder's tooth!</li>
  <li>How ill-beseeming is it in thy sex</li>
  <li>To triumph, like an Amazonian trull,</li>
  <li class="number">Upon their woes whom fortune captivates!</li>
  <li>But that thy face is, vizard-like, unchanging,</li>
  <li>Made impudent with use of evil deeds,</li>
  <li>I would assay, proud queen, to make thee blush.</li>
  <li>To tell thee whence thou camest, of whom derived,</li>
  <li class="number">Were shame enough to shame thee, wert thou not shameless.</li>
  <li>Thy father bears the type of King of Naples,</li>
  <li>Of both the Sicils and Jerusalem,</li>
  <li>Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman.</li>
  <li>Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult?</li>
  <li class="number">It needs not, nor it boots thee not, proud queen,</li>
  <li>Unless the adage must be verified,</li>
  <li>That beggars mounted run their horse to death.</li>
  <li>'Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud;</li>
  <li>But, God he knows, thy share thereof is small:</li>
  <li class="number">'Tis virtue that doth make them most admired;</li>
  <li>The contrary doth make thee wonder'd at:</li>
  <li>'Tis government that makes them seem divine;</li>
  <li>The want thereof makes thee abominable:</li>
  <li>Thou art as opposite to every good</li>
  <li class="number">As the Antipodes are unto us,</li>
  <li>Or as the south to the septentrion.</li>
  <li>O tiger's heart wrapt in a woman's hide!</li>
  <li>How couldst thou drain the life-blood of the child,</li>
  <li>To bid the father wipe his eyes withal,</li>
  <li class="number">And yet be seen to bear a woman's face?</li>
  <li>Women are soft, mild, pitiful and flexible;</li>
  <li>Thou stern, obdurate, flinty, rough, remorseless.</li>
  <li>Bids't thou me rage? why, now thou hast thy wish:</li>
  <li>Wouldst have me weep? why, now thou hast thy will:</li>
  <li class="number">For raging wind blows up incessant showers,</li>
  <li>And when the rage allays, the rain begins.</li>
  <li>These tears are my sweet Rutland's obsequies:</li>
  <li>And every drop cries vengeance for his death,</li>
  <li>'Gainst thee, fell Clifford, and thee, false</li>

  <li>O, ten times more, than tigers of Hyrcania.</li>
  <li>See, ruthless queen, a hapless father's tears:</li>
  <li>This cloth thou dip'dst in blood of my sweet boy,</li>
  <li>And I with tears do wash the blood away.</li>
  <li class="number">Keep thou the napkin, and go boast of this:</li>
  <li>And if thou tell'st the heavy story right,</li>
  <li>Upon my soul, the hearers will shed tears;</li>
  <li>Yea even my foes will shed fast-falling tears,</li>
  <li>And say 'Alas, it was a piteous deed!'</li>
  <li class="number">There, take the crown, and, with the crown, my curse;</li>
  <li>And in thy need such comfort come to thee</li>
  <li>As now I reap at thy too cruel hand!</li>

<h3>SCENE I.  A plain near Mortimer's Cross in Herefordshire.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">A march. Enter EDWARD, RICHARD, and their power</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EDWARD</li>
  <li>I wonder how our princely father 'scaped,</li>
  <li>Or whether he be 'scaped away or no</li>
  <li>From Clifford's and Northumberland's pursuit:</li>
  <li>Had he been ta'en, we should have heard the news;</li>
  <li class="number">Had he been slain, we should have heard the news;</li>
  <li>Or had he 'scaped, methinks we should have heard</li>
  <li>The happy tidings of his good escape.</li>
  <li>How fares my brother? why is he so sad?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">RICHARD</li>
  <li>I cannot joy, until I be resolved</li>
  <li class="number">Where our right valiant father is become.</li>
  <li>I saw him in the battle range about;</li>
  <li>And watch'd him how he singled Clifford forth.</li>
  <li>Methought he bore him in the thickest troop</li>
  <li>As doth a lion in a herd of neat;</li>
  <li class="number">Or as a bear, encompass'd round with dogs,</li>
  <li>Who having pinch'd a few and made them cry,</li>
  <li>The rest stand all aloof, and bark at him.</li>
  <li>So fared our father with his enemies;</li>
  <li>So fled his enemies my warlike father:</li>
  <li class="number">Methinks, 'tis prize enough to be his son.</li>
  <li>See how the morning opes her golden gates,</li>
  <li>And takes her farewell of the glorious sun!</li>
  <li>How well resembles it the prime of youth,</li>
  <li>Trimm'd like a younker prancing to his love!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EDWARD</li>
  <li class="number">Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">RICHARD</li>
  <li>Three glorious suns, each one a perfect sun;</li>
  <li>Not separated with the racking clouds,</li>
  <li>But sever'd in a pale clear-shining sky.</li>
  <li>See, see! they join, embrace, and seem to kiss,</li>
  <li class="number">As if they vow'd some league inviolable:</li>
  <li>Now are they but one lamp, one light, one sun.</li>
  <li>In this the heaven figures some event.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EDWARD</li>
  <li>'Tis wondrous strange, the like yet never heard of.</li>
  <li>I think it cites us, brother, to the field,</li>
  <li class="number">That we, the sons of brave Plantagenet,</li>
  <li>Each one already blazing by our meeds,</li>
  <li>Should notwithstanding join our lights together</li>
  <li>And over-shine the earth as this the world.</li>
  <li>Whate'er it bodes, henceforward will I bear</li>
  <li class="number">Upon my target three fair-shining suns.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">RICHARD</li>
  <li>Nay, bear three daughters: by your leave I speak it,</li>
  <li>You love the breeder better than the male.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Enter a Messenger</li>
  <li>But what art thou, whose heavy looks foretell</li>
  <li>Some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Messenger</li>
  <li class="number">Ah, one that was a woful looker-on</li>
  <li>When as the noble Duke of York was slain,</li>
  <li>Your princely father and my loving lord!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EDWARD</li>
  <li>O, speak no more, for I have heard too much.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">RICHARD</li>
  <li>Say how he died, for I will hear it all.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Messenger</li>
  <li class="number">Environed he was with many foes,</li>
  <li>And stood against them, as the hope of Troy</li>
  <li>Against the Greeks that would have enter'd Troy.</li>
  <li>But Hercules himself must yield to odds;</li>
  <li>And many strokes, though with a little axe,</li>
  <li class="number">Hew down and fell the hardest-timber'd oak.</li>
  <li>By many hands your father was subdued;</li>
  <li>But only slaughter'd by the ireful arm</li>
  <li>Of unrelenting Clifford and the queen,</li>
  <li>Who crown'd the gracious duke in high despite,</li>
  <li class="number">Laugh'd in his face; and when with grief he wept,</li>
  <li>The ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks</li>
  <li>A napkin steeped in the harmless blood</li>
  <li>Of sweet young Rutland, by rough Clifford slain:</li>
  <li>And after many scorns, many foul taunts,</li>
  <li class="number">They took his head, and on the gates of York</li>
  <li>They set the same; and there it doth remain,</li>
  <li>The saddest spectacle that e'er I view'd.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EDWARD</li>
  <li>Sweet Duke of York, our prop to lean upon,</li>
  <li>Now thou art gone, we have no staff, no stay.</li>
  <li class="number">O Clifford, boisterous Clifford! thou hast slain</li>
  <li>The flower of Europe for his chivalry;</li>
  <li>And treacherously hast thou vanquish'd him,</li>
  <li>For hand to hand he would have vanquish'd thee.</li>
  <li>Now my soul's palace is become a prison:</li>
  <li class="number">Ah, would she break from hence, that this my body</li>
  <li>Might in the ground be closed up in rest!</li>
  <li>For never henceforth shall I joy again,</li>
  <li>Never, O never shall I see more joy!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">RICHARD</li>
  <li>I cannot weep; for all my body's moisture</li>
  <li class="number">Scarce serves to quench my furnace-burning heart:</li>
  <li>Nor can my tongue unload my heart's great burthen;</li>
  <li>For selfsame wind that I should speak withal</li>
  <li>Is kindling coals that fires all my breast,</li>
  <li>And burns me up with flames that tears would quench.</li>
  <li class="number">To weep is to make less the depth of grief:</li>
  <li>Tears then for babes; blows and revenge for me</li>
  <li>Richard, I bear thy name; I'll venge thy death,</li>
  <li>Or die renowned by attempting it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EDWARD</li>
  <li>His name that valiant duke hath left with thee;</li>
  <li class="number">His dukedom and his chair with me is left.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">RICHARD</li>
  <li>Nay, if thou be that princely eagle's bird,</li>
  <li>Show thy descent by gazing 'gainst the sun:</li>
  <li>For chair and dukedom, throne and kingdom say;</li>
  <li>Either that is thine, or else thou wert not his.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">March. Enter WARWICK, MONTAGUE, and their army</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WARWICK</li>
  <li class="number">How now, fair lords! What fare? what news abroad?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">RICHARD</li>
  <li>Great Lord of Warwick, if we should recount</li>
  <li>Our baleful news, and at each word's deliverance</li>
  <li>Stab poniards in our flesh till all were told,</li>
  <li>The words would add more anguish than the wounds.</li>
  <li class="number">O valiant lord, the Duke of York is slain!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EDWARD</li>
  <li>O Warwick, Warwick! that Plantagenet,</li>
  <li>Which held three dearly as his soul's redemption,</li>
  <li>Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WARWICK</li>
  <li>Ten days ago I drown'd these news in tears;</li>
  <li class="number">And now, to add more measure to your woes,</li>
  <li>I come to tell you things sith then befall'n.</li>
  <li>After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought,</li>
  <li>Where your brave father breathed his latest gasp,</li>
  <li>Tidings, as swiftly as the posts could run,</li>
  <li class="number">Were brought me of your loss and his depart.</li>
  <li>I, then in London keeper of the king,</li>
  <li>Muster'd my soldiers, gather'd flocks of friends,</li>
  <li>And very well appointed, as I thought,</li>
  <li>March'd toward Saint Alban's to intercept the queen,</li>
  <li class="number">Bearing the king in my behalf along;</li>
  <li>For by my scouts I was advertised</li>
  <li>That she was coming with a full intent</li>
  <li>To dash our late decree in parliament</li>
  <li>Touching King Henry's oath and your succession.</li>
  <li class="number">Short tale to make, we at Saint Alban's met</li>
  <li>Our battles join'd, and both sides fiercely fought:</li>
  <li>But whether 'twas the coldness of the king,</li>
  <li>Who look'd full gently on his warlike queen,</li>
  <li>That robb'd my soldiers of their heated spleen;</li>
  <li class="number">Or whether 'twas report of her success;</li>
  <li>Or more than common fear of Clifford's rigour,</li>
  <li>Who thunders to his captives blood and death,</li>
  <li>I cannot judge: but to conclude with truth,</li>
  <li>Their weapons like to lightning came and went;</li>
  <li class="number">Our soldiers', like the night-owl's lazy flight,</li>
  <li>Or like an idle thresher with a flail,</li>
  <li>Fell gently down, as if they struck their friends.</li>
  <li>I cheer'd them up with justice of our cause,</li>
  <li>With promise of high pay and great rewards:</li>
  <li class="number">But all in vain; they had no heart to fight,</li>
  <li>And we in them no hope to win the day;</li>
  <li>So that we fled; the king unto the queen;</li>
  <li>Lord George your brother, Norfolk and myself,</li>
  <li>In haste, post-haste, are come to join with you:</li>
  <li class="number">For in the marches here we heard you were,</li>
  <li>Making another head to fight again.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EDWARD</li>
  <li>Where is the Duke of Norfolk, gentle Warwick?</li>
  <li>And when came George from Burgundy to England?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WARWICK</li>
  <li>Some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers;</li>
  <li class="number">And for your brother, he was lately sent</li>
  <li>From your kind aunt, Duchess of Burgundy,</li>
  <li>With aid of soldiers to this needful war.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">RICHARD</li>
  <li>'Twas odds, belike, when valiant Warwick fled:</li>
  <li>Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit,</li>
  <li class="number">But ne'er till now his scandal of retire.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WARWICK</li>
  <li>Nor now my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear;</li>
  <li>For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine</li>
  <li>Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry's head,</li>
  <li>And wring the awful sceptre from his fist,</li>
  <li class="number">Were he as famous and as bold in war</li>
  <li>As he is famed for mildness, peace, and prayer.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">RICHARD</li>
  <li>I know it well, Lord Warwick; blame me not:</li>
  <li>'Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak.</li>
  <li>But in this troublous time what's to be done?</li>
  <li class="number">Shall we go throw away our coats of steel,</li>
  <li>And wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns,</li>
  <li>Numbering our Ave-Maries with our beads?</li>
  <li>Or shall we on the helmets of our foes</li>
  <li>Tell our devotion with revengeful arms?</li>
  <li class="number">If for the last, say ay, and to it, lords.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WARWICK</li>
  <li>Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out;</li>
  <li>And therefore comes my brother Montague.</li>
  <li>Attend me, lords. The proud insulting queen,</li>
  <li>With Clifford and the haught Northumberland,</li>
  <li class="number">And of their feather many more proud birds,</li>
  <li>Have wrought the easy-melting king like wax.</li>
  <li>He swore consent to your succession,</li>
  <li>His oath enrolled in the parliament;</li>
  <li>And now to London all the crew are gone,</li>
  <li class="number">To frustrate both his oath and what beside</li>
  <li>May make against the house of Lancaster.</li>
  <li>Their power, I think, is thirty thousand strong:</li>
  <li>Now, if the help of Norfolk and myself,</li>
  <li>With all the friends that thou, brave Earl of March,</li>
  <li class="number">Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure,</li>
  <li>Will but amount to five and twenty thousand,</li>
  <li>Why, Via! to London will we march amain,</li>
  <li>And once again bestride our foaming steeds,</li>
  <li>And once again cry 'Charge upon our foes!'</li>
  <li class="number">But never once again turn back and fly.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">RICHARD</li>
  <li>Ay, now methinks I hear great Warwick speak:</li>
  <li>Ne'er may he live to see a sunshine day,</li>
  <li>That cries 'Retire,' if Warwick bid him stay.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EDWARD</li>
  <li>Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean;</li>
  <li class="number">And when thou fail'st â€” as God forbid the hour! â€” </li>
  <li>Must Edward fall, which peril heaven forfend!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WARWICK</li>
  <li>No longer Earl of March, but Duke of York:</li>
  <li>The next degree is England's royal throne;</li>
  <li>For King of England shalt thou be proclaim'd</li>
  <li class="number">In every borough as we pass along;</li>
  <li>And he that throws not up his cap for joy</li>
  <li>Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head.</li>
  <li>King Edward, valiant Richard, Montague,</li>
  <li>Stay we no longer, dreaming of renown,</li>
  <li class="number">But sound the trumpets, and about our task.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">RICHARD</li>
  <li>Then, Clifford, were thy heart as hard as steel,</li>
  <li>As thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds,</li>
  <li>I come to pierce it, or to give thee mine.</li>
</ol>

  <li>Welcome, my lord, to this brave town of York.</li>
  <li>Yonder's the head of that arch-enemy</li>

  <li>Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick?</li>
  <li>Not his that spoils her young before her face.</li>
  <li class="number">Who 'scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting?</li>
  <li>Not he that sets his foot upon her back.</li>
  <li>The smallest worm will turn being trodden on,</li>

  <li>Ambitious York doth level at thy crown,</li>
  <li class="number">Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows:</li>
  <li>He, but a duke, would have his son a king,</li>
  <li>And raise his issue, like a loving sire;</li>
  <li>Thou, being a king, blest with a goodly son,</li>
  <li>Didst yield consent to disinherit him,</li>
  <li class="number">Which argued thee a most unloving father.</li>
  <li>Unreasonable creatures feed their young;</li>
  <li>And though man's face be fearful to their eyes,</li>
  <li>Yet, in protection of their tender ones,</li>
  <li>Who hath not seen them, even with those wings</li>
  <li class="number">Which sometime they have used with fearful flight,</li>
  <li>Make war with him that climb'd unto their nest,</li>
  <li>Offer their own lives in their young's defence?</li>
  <li>For shame, my liege, make them your precedent!</li>
  <li>Were it not pity that this goodly boy</li>

  <li>And long hereafter say unto his child,</li>
  <li>'What my great-grandfather and his grandsire got</li>

<h3>SCENE VI.  Another part of the field.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">A loud alarum. Enter CLIFFORD, wounded</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CLIFFORD</li>
  <li>Here burns my candle out; ay, here it dies,</li>
  <li>Which, whiles it lasted, gave King Henry light.</li>
  <li>O Lancaster, I fear thy overthrow</li>
  <li>More than my body's parting with my soul!</li>
  <li class="number">My love and fear glued many friends to thee;</li>
  <li>And, now I fall, thy tough commixture melts.</li>
  <li>Impairing Henry, strengthening misproud York,</li>
  <li>The common people swarm like summer flies;</li>
  <li>And whither fly the gnats but to the sun?</li>
  <li class="number">And who shines now but Henry's enemies?</li>
  <li>O Phoebus, hadst thou never given consent</li>
  <li>That Phaethon should cheque thy fiery steeds,</li>
  <li>Thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth!</li>
  <li>And, Henry, hadst thou sway'd as kings should do,</li>
  <li class="number">Or as thy father and his father did,</li>
  <li>Giving no ground unto the house of York,</li>
  <li>They never then had sprung like summer flies;</li>
  <li>I and ten thousand in this luckless realm</li>
  <li>Had left no mourning widows for our death;</li>
  <li class="number">And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace.</li>
  <li>For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air?</li>
  <li>And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity?</li>
  <li>Bootless are plaints, and cureless are my wounds;</li>
  <li>No way to fly, nor strength to hold out flight:</li>
  <li class="number">The foe is merciless, and will not pity;</li>
  <li>For at their hands I have deserved no pity.</li>
  <li>The air hath got into my deadly wounds,</li>
  <li>And much effuse of blood doth make me faint.</li>
  <li>Come, York and Richard, Warwick and the rest;</li>
  <li class="number">I stabb'd your fathers' bosoms, split my breast.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">He faints</div>

<div class="stage-direction">Alarum and retreat. Enter EDWARD, GEORGE, RICHARD,
MONTAGUE, WARWICK, and Soldiers</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EDWARD</li>
  <li>Now breathe we, lords: good fortune bids us pause,</li>
  <li>And smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks.</li>
  <li>Some troops pursue the bloody-minded queen,</li>
  <li>That led calm Henry, though he were a king,</li>
  <li class="number">As doth a sail, fill'd with a fretting gust,</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WARWICK</li>
  <li>No, 'tis impossible he should escape,</li>
  <li>For, though before his face I speak the words</li>
  <li class="number">Your brother Richard mark'd him for the grave:</li>

  <li class="speaker">EDWARD</li>

  <li class="speaker">RICHARD</li>
  <li>A deadly groan, like life and death's departing.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EDWARD</li>
  <li>See who it is: and, now the battle's ended,</li>
  <li class="number">If friend or foe, let him be gently used.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">RICHARD</li>
  <li>Revoke that doom of mercy, for 'tis Clifford;</li>
  <li>Who not contented that he lopp'd the branch</li>
  <li>In hewing Rutland when his leaves put forth,</li>
  <li>But set his murdering knife unto the root</li>
  <li class="number">From whence that tender spray did sweetly spring,</li>
  <li>I mean our princely father, Duke of York.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WARWICK</li>
  <li>From off the gates of York fetch down the head,</li>
  <li>Your father's head, which Clifford placed there;</li>
  <li>Instead whereof let this supply the room:</li>
  <li class="number">Measure for measure must be answered.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EDWARD</li>
  <li>Bring forth that fatal screech-owl to our house,</li>
  <li>That nothing sung but death to us and ours:</li>
  <li>Now death shall stop his dismal threatening sound,</li>
  <li>And his ill-boding tongue no more shall speak.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WARWICK</li>
  <li class="number">I think his understanding is bereft.</li>
  <li>Speak, Clifford, dost thou know who speaks to thee?</li>
  <li>Dark cloudy death o'ershades his beams of life,</li>
  <li>And he nor sees nor hears us what we say.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">RICHARD</li>
  <li>O, would he did! and so perhaps he doth:</li>
  <li class="number">'Tis but his policy to counterfeit,</li>
  <li>Because he would avoid such bitter taunts</li>
  <li>Which in the time of death he gave our father.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">

  <li>If so thou think'st, vex him with eager words.</li>

  <li>Clifford, ask mercy and obtain no grace.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EDWARD</li>
  <li class="number">Clifford, repent in bootless penitence.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WARWICK</li>
  <li>Clifford, devise excuses for thy faults.</li>

  <li>While we devise fell tortures for thy faults.</li>

  <li>They mock thee, Clifford: swear as thou wast wont.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">RICHARD</li>
  <li>What, not an oath? nay, then the world goes hard</li>
  <li>When Clifford cannot spare his friends an oath.</li>
  <li>I know by that he's dead; and, by my soul,</li>
  <li class="number">If this right hand would buy two hour's life,</li>
  <li>That I in all despite might rail at him,</li>
  <li>This hand should chop it off, and with the</li>
  <li>issuing blood</li>
  <li>Stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst</li>
  <li class="number">York and young Rutland could not satisfy.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WARWICK</li>
  <li>Ay, but he's dead: off with the traitor's head,</li>
  <li>And rear it in the place your father's stands.</li>
  <li>And now to London with triumphant march,</li>
  <li>There to be crowned England's royal king:</li>
  <li class="number">From whence shall Warwick cut the sea to France,</li>
  <li>And ask the Lady Bona for thy queen:</li>
  <li>So shalt thou sinew both these lands together;</li>
  <li>And, having France thy friend, thou shalt not dread</li>
  <li>The scatter'd foe that hopes to rise again;</li>
  <li class="number">For though they cannot greatly sting to hurt,</li>
  <li>Yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears.</li>
  <li>First will I see the coronation;</li>
  <li>And then to Brittany I'll cross the sea,</li>
  <li>To effect this marriage, so it please my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EDWARD</li>
  <li class="number">Even as thou wilt, sweet Warwick, let it be;</li>
  <li>For in thy shoulder do I build my seat,</li>
  <li>And never will I undertake the thing</li>
  <li>Wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting.</li>
  <li>Richard, I will create thee Duke of Gloucester,</li>

  <li class="speaker">Second Keeper</li>
  <li class="number">I'll stay above the hill, so both may shoot.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Keeper</li>
  <li>That cannot be; the noise of thy cross-bow</li>
  <li>Will scare the herd, and so my shoot is lost.</li>
  <li>Here stand we both, and aim we at the best:</li>
  <li>And, for the time shall not seem tedious,</li>
  <li class="number">I'll tell thee what befell me on a day</li>
  <li>In this self-place where now we mean to stand.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Keeper</li>
  <li>Here comes a man; let's stay till he be past.</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter KING HENRY VI, disguised, with a prayerbook</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING HENRY VI</li>
  <li>From Scotland am I stol'n, even of pure love,</li>
  <li>To greet mine own land with my wishful sight.</li>
  <li class="number">No, Harry, Harry, 'tis no land of thine;</li>
  <li>Thy place is fill'd, thy sceptre wrung from thee,</li>

  <li>Ay, here's a deer whose skin's a keeper's fee:</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING HENRY VI</li>
  <li>My queen and son are gone to France for aid;</li>
  <li>And, as I hear, the great commanding Warwick</li>
  <li class="number">Is thither gone, to crave the French king's sister</li>
  <li>To wife for Edward: if this news be true,</li>
  <li>Poor queen and son, your labour is but lost;</li>
  <li>For Warwick is a subtle orator,</li>
  <li>And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words.</li>
  <li class="number">By this account then Margaret may win him;</li>
  <li>For she's a woman to be pitied much:</li>
  <li>Her sighs will make a battery in his breast;</li>
  <li>Her tears will pierce into a marble heart;</li>
  <li>The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn;</li>
  <li class="number">And Nero will be tainted with remorse,</li>
  <li>To hear and see her plaints, her brinish tears.</li>
  <li>Ay, but she's come to beg, Warwick to give;</li>
  <li>She, on his left side, craving aid for Henry,</li>
  <li>He, on his right, asking a wife for Edward.</li>
  <li class="number">She weeps, and says her Henry is deposed;</li>
  <li>He smiles, and says his Edward is install'd;</li>
  <li>That she, poor wretch, for grief can speak no more;</li>
  <li>Whiles Warwick tells his title, smooths the wrong,</li>
  <li>Inferreth arguments of mighty strength,</li>
  <li class="number">And in conclusion wins the king from her,</li>
  <li>With promise of his sister, and what else,</li>
  <li>To strengthen and support King Edward's place.</li>
  <li>O Margaret, thus 'twill be; and thou, poor soul,</li>
  <li>Art then forsaken, as thou went'st forlorn!</li>

  <li class="number">Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING HENRY VI</li>
  <li>More than I seem, and less than I was born to:</li>
  <li>A man at least, for less I should not be;</li>
  <li>And men may talk of kings, and why not I?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Keeper</li>
  <li>Ay, but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king.</li>

  <li class="number">Why, so I am, in mind; and that's enough.</li>

  <li>But, if thou be a king, where is thy crown?</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING HENRY VI</li>
  <li>My crown is in my heart, not on my head;</li>
  <li>Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones,</li>
  <li>Nor to be seen: my crown is called content:</li>
  <li class="number">A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Keeper</li>
  <li>Well, if you be a king crown'd with content,</li>
  <li>Your crown content and you must be contented</li>
  <li>To go along with us; for as we think,</li>
  <li>You are the king King Edward hath deposed;</li>
  <li class="number">And we his subjects sworn in all allegiance</li>
  <li>Will apprehend you as his enemy.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING HENRY VI</li>
  <li>But did you never swear, and break an oath?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Keeper</li>
  <li>No, never such an oath; nor will not now.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">

  <li>Why, am I dead? do I not breathe a man?</li>
  <li>Ah, simple men, you know not what you swear!</li>
  <li>Look, as I blow this feather from my face,</li>
  <li class="number">And as the air blows it to me again,</li>
  <li>Obeying with my wind when I do blow,</li>
  <li>And yielding to another when it blows,</li>
  <li>Commanded always by the greater gust;</li>
  <li>Such is the lightness of you common men.</li>
  <li class="number">But do not break your oaths; for of that sin</li>
  <li>My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty.</li>
  <li>Go where you will, the king shall be commanded;</li>
  <li>And be you kings, command, and I'll obey.</li>

  <li>Then get your husband's lands, to do them good.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LADY GREY</li>
  <li>Therefore I came unto your majesty.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING EDWARD IV</li>
  <li class="number">I'll tell you how these lands are to be got.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LADY GREY</li>
  <li>So shall you bind me to your highness' service.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING EDWARD IV</li>
  <li>What service wilt thou do me, if I give them?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LADY GREY</li>
  <li>What you command, that rests in me to do.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING EDWARD IV</li>
  <li>But you will take exceptions to my boon.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LADY GREY</li>
  <li class="number">No, gracious lord, except I cannot do it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING EDWARD IV</li>
  <li>Ay, but thou canst do what I mean to ask.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LADY GREY</li>
  <li>Why, then I will do what your grace commands.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>Aside to CLARENCE  He plies her hard; and much rain</li>
  <li>wears the marble.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CLARENCE</li>
  <li class="number">Aside to GLOUCESTER  As red as fire! nay, then</li>
  <li>her wax must melt.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LADY GREY</li>
  <li>Why stops my lord, shall I not hear my task?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING EDWARD IV</li>
  <li>An easy task; 'tis but to love a king.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LADY GREY</li>
  <li>That's soon perform'd, because I am a subject.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING EDWARD IV</li>
  <li class="number">Why, then, thy husband's lands I freely give thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LADY GREY</li>
  <li>I take my leave with many thousand thanks.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>Aside to CLARENCE  The match is made; she seals it</li>
  <li>with a curtsy.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING EDWARD IV</li>
  <li>But stay thee, 'tis the fruits of love I mean.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LADY GREY</li>
  <li class="number">The fruits of love I mean, my loving liege.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING EDWARD IV</li>
  <li>Ay, but, I fear me, in another sense.</li>
  <li>What love, think'st thou, I sue so much to get?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LADY GREY</li>
  <li>My love till death, my humble thanks, my prayers;</li>
  <li>That love which virtue begs and virtue grants.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING EDWARD IV</li>
  <li class="number">No, by my troth, I did not mean such love.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LADY GREY</li>
  <li>Why, then you mean not as I thought you did.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING EDWARD IV</li>
  <li>But now you partly may perceive my mind.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LADY GREY</li>
  <li>My mind will never grant what I perceive</li>
  <li>Your highness aims at, if I aim aright.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING EDWARD IV</li>
  <li class="number">To tell thee plain, I aim to lie with thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LADY GREY</li>
  <li>To tell you plain, I had rather lie in prison.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING EDWARD IV</li>
  <li>Why, then thou shalt not have thy husband's lands.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LADY GREY</li>
  <li>Why, then mine honesty shall be my dower;</li>
  <li>For by that loss I will not purchase them.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING EDWARD IV</li>
  <li class="number">Therein thou wrong'st thy children mightily.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LADY GREY</li>
  <li>Herein your highness wrongs both them and me.</li>
  <li>But, mighty lord, this merry inclination</li>
  <li>Accords not with the sadness of my suit:</li>
  <li>Please you dismiss me either with 'ay' or 'no.'</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING EDWARD IV</li>
  <li class="number">Ay, if thou wilt say 'ay' to my request;</li>
  <li>No if thou dost say 'no' to my demand.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LADY GREY</li>
  <li>Then, no, my lord. My suit is at an end.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LADY GREY</li>
  <li>And that is more than I will yield unto:</li>

  <li>Have other some: why, 'tis a happy thing</li>

  <li>Would he were wasted, marrow, bones and all,</li>

  <li>To cross me from the golden time I look for!</li>
  <li>And yet, between my soul's desire and me â€” </li>
  <li class="number">The lustful Edward's title buried â€” </li>
  <li>Is Clarence, Henry, and his son young Edward,</li>
  <li>And all the unlook'd for issue of their bodies,</li>
  <li>To take their rooms, ere I can place myself:</li>
  <li>A cold premeditation for my purpose!</li>
  <li class="number">Why, then, I do but dream on sovereignty;</li>
  <li>Like one that stands upon a promontory,</li>
  <li>And spies a far-off shore where he would tread,</li>
  <li>Wishing his foot were equal with his eye,</li>
  <li>And chides the sea that sunders him from thence,</li>
  <li class="number">Saying, he'll lade it dry to have his way:</li>
  <li>So do I wish the crown, being so far off;</li>
  <li>And so I chide the means that keeps me from it;</li>
  <li>And so I say, I'll cut the causes off,</li>
  <li>Flattering me with impossibilities.</li>
  <li class="number">My eye's too quick, my heart o'erweens too much,</li>
  <li>Unless my hand and strength could equal them.</li>
  <li>Well, say there is no kingdom then for Richard;</li>
  <li>What other pleasure can the world afford?</li>
  <li>I'll make my heaven in a lady's lap,</li>
  <li class="number">And deck my body in gay ornaments,</li>
  <li>And witch sweet ladies with my words and looks.</li>
  <li>O miserable thought! and more unlikely</li>
  <li>Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns!</li>
  <li>Why, love forswore me in my mother's womb:</li>
  <li class="number">And, for I should not deal in her soft laws,</li>
  <li>She did corrupt frail nature with some bribe,</li>
  <li>To shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub;</li>
  <li>To make an envious mountain on my back,</li>
  <li>Where sits deformity to mock my body;</li>
  <li class="number">To shape my legs of an unequal size;</li>
  <li>To disproportion me in every part,</li>
  <li>Like to a chaos, or an unlick'd bear-whelp</li>
  <li>That carries no impression like the dam.</li>
  <li>And am I then a man to be beloved?</li>
  <li class="number">O monstrous fault, to harbour such a thought!</li>
  <li>Then, since this earth affords no joy to me,</li>
  <li>But to command, to cheque, to o'erbear such</li>
  <li>As are of better person than myself,</li>
  <li>I'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown,</li>
  <li class="number">And, whiles I live, to account this world but hell,</li>
  <li>Until my mis-shaped trunk that bears this head</li>
  <li>Be round impaled with a glorious crown.</li>
  <li>And yet I know not how to get the crown,</li>
  <li>For many lives stand between me and home:</li>
  <li class="number">And I â€”  like one lost in a thorny wood,</li>
  <li>That rends the thorns and is rent with the thorns,</li>
  <li>Seeking a way and straying from the way;</li>
  <li>Not knowing how to find the open air,</li>
  <li>But toiling desperately to find it out â€”  </li>
  <li class="number">Torment myself to catch the English crown:</li>
  <li>And from that torment I will free myself,</li>
  <li>Or hew my way out with a bloody axe.</li>
  <li>Why, I can smile, and murder whiles I smile,</li>
  <li>And cry 'Content' to that which grieves my heart,</li>
  <li class="number">And wet my cheeks with artificial tears,</li>
  <li>And frame my face to all occasions.</li>
  <li>I'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall;</li>
  <li>I'll slay more gazers than the basilisk;</li>
  <li>I'll play the orator as well as Nestor,</li>
  <li class="number">Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,</li>
  <li>And, like a Sinon, take another Troy.</li>
  <li>I can add colours to the chameleon,</li>
  <li>Change shapes with Proteus for advantages,</li>
  <li>And set the murderous Machiavel to school.</li>
  <li class="number">Can I do this, and cannot get a crown?</li>
  <li>Tut, were it farther off, I'll pluck it down.</li>

<h3>SCENE III.  France. KING LEWIS XI's palace.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Flourish. Enter KING LEWIS XI, his sister BONA,
his Admiral, called BOURBON, PRINCE EDWARD, QUEEN
MARGARET, and OXFORD. KING LEWIS XI sits, and
riseth up again</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING LEWIS XI</li>
  <li>Fair Queen of England, worthy Margaret,</li>
  <li>Sit down with us: it ill befits thy state</li>
  <li>And birth, that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">QUEEN MARGARET</li>
  <li>No, mighty King of France: now Margaret</li>
  <li class="number">Must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve</li>
  <li>Where kings command. I was, I must confess,</li>
  <li>Great Albion's queen in former golden days:</li>
  <li>But now mischance hath trod my title down,</li>
  <li>And with dishonour laid me on the ground;</li>
  <li class="number">Where I must take like seat unto my fortune,</li>
  <li>And to my humble seat conform myself.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING LEWIS XI</li>
  <li>Why, say, fair queen, whence springs this deep despair?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">QUEEN MARGARET</li>
  <li>From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears</li>
  <li>And stops my tongue, while heart is drown'd in cares.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING LEWIS XI</li>
  <li class="number">Whate'er it be, be thou still like thyself,</li>
  <li>And sit thee by our side:</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Seats her by him</li>
  <li>Yield not thy neck</li>
  <li>To fortune's yoke, but let thy dauntless mind</li>
  <li>Still ride in triumph over all mischance.</li>
  <li class="number">Be plain, Queen Margaret, and tell thy grief;</li>
  <li>It shall be eased, if France can yield relief.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">QUEEN MARGARET</li>
  <li>Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts</li>
  <li>And give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak.</li>
  <li>Now, therefore, be it known to noble Lewis,</li>
  <li class="number">That Henry, sole possessor of my love,</li>
  <li>Is of a king become a banish'd man,</li>
  <li>And forced to live in Scotland a forlorn;</li>
  <li>While proud ambitious Edward Duke of York</li>
  <li>Usurps the regal title and the seat</li>
  <li class="number">Of England's true-anointed lawful king.</li>
  <li>This is the cause that I, poor Margaret,</li>
  <li>With this my son, Prince Edward, Henry's heir,</li>
  <li>Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid;</li>
  <li>And if thou fail us, all our hope is done:</li>
  <li class="number">Scotland hath will to help, but cannot help;</li>
  <li>Our people and our peers are both misled,</li>
  <li>Our treasures seized, our soldiers put to flight,</li>
  <li>And, as thou seest, ourselves in heavy plight.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING LEWIS XI</li>
  <li>Renowned queen, with patience calm the storm,</li>
  <li class="number">While we bethink a means to break it off.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">QUEEN MARGARET</li>
  <li>The more we stay, the stronger grows our foe.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING LEWIS XI</li>
  <li>The more I stay, the more I'll succor thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">

  <li class="number">What's he approacheth boldly to our presence?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">QUEEN MARGARET</li>
  <li>Our Earl of Warwick, Edward's greatest friend.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING LEWIS XI</li>
  <li>Welcome, brave Warwick! What brings thee to France?</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">He descends. She ariseth</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">QUEEN MARGARET</li>
  <li>Ay, now begins a second storm to rise;</li>
  <li>For this is he that moves both wind and tide.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WARWICK</li>
  <li class="number">From worthy Edward, King of Albion,</li>
  <li>My lord and sovereign, and thy vowed friend,</li>
  <li>I come, in kindness and unfeigned love,</li>
  <li>First, to do greetings to thy royal person;</li>
  <li>And then to crave a league of amity;</li>
  <li class="number">And lastly, to confirm that amity</li>
  <li>With a nuptial knot, if thou vouchsafe to grant</li>
  <li>That virtuous Lady Bona, thy fair sister,</li>
  <li>To England's king in lawful marriage.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">QUEEN MARGARET</li>
  <li>Aside  If that go forward, Henry's hope is done.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WARWICK</li>
  <li class="number">To BONA  And, gracious madam, in our king's behalf,</li>
  <li>I am commanded, with your leave and favour,</li>
  <li>Humbly to kiss your hand, and with my tongue</li>
  <li>To tell the passion of my sovereign's heart;</li>
  <li>Where fame, late entering at his heedful ears,</li>
  <li class="number">Hath placed thy beauty's image and thy virtue.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">QUEEN MARGARET</li>
  <li>King Lewis and Lady Bona, hear me speak,</li>
  <li>Before you answer Warwick. His demand</li>
  <li>Springs not from Edward's well-meant honest love,</li>
  <li>But from deceit bred by necessity;</li>
  <li class="number">For how can tyrants safely govern home,</li>
  <li>Unless abroad they purchase great alliance?</li>
  <li>To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice,</li>
  <li>That Henry liveth still: but were he dead,</li>
  <li>Yet here Prince Edward stands, King Henry's son.</li>
  <li class="number">Look, therefore, Lewis, that by this league and marriage</li>
  <li>Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour;</li>
  <li>For though usurpers sway the rule awhile,</li>
  <li>Yet heavens are just, and time suppresseth wrongs.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WARWICK</li>
  <li>Injurious Margaret!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE EDWARD</li>
  <li class="number">And why not queen?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WARWICK</li>
  <li>Because thy father Henry did usurp;</li>
  <li>And thou no more are prince than she is queen.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OXFORD</li>
  <li>Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt,</li>
  <li>Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain;</li>
  <li class="number">And, after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth,</li>
  <li>Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest;</li>
  <li>And, after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth,</li>
  <li>Who by his prowess conquered all France:</li>
  <li>From these our Henry lineally descends.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WARWICK</li>
  <li class="number">Oxford, how haps it, in this smooth discourse,</li>
  <li>You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost</li>
  <li>All that which Henry Fifth had gotten?</li>
  <li>Methinks these peers of France should smile at that.</li>
  <li>But for the rest, you tell a pedigree</li>
  <li class="number">Of threescore and two years; a silly time</li>
  <li>To make prescription for a kingdom's worth.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OXFORD</li>
  <li>Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege,</li>
  <li>Whom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years,</li>
  <li>And not bewray thy treason with a blush?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WARWICK</li>
  <li class="number">Can Oxford, that did ever fence the right,</li>
  <li>Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree?</li>
  <li>For shame! leave Henry, and call Edward king.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OXFORD</li>
  <li>Call him my king by whose injurious doom</li>
  <li>My elder brother, the Lord Aubrey Vere,</li>
  <li class="number">Was done to death? and more than so, my father,</li>
  <li>Even in the downfall of his mellow'd years,</li>
  <li>When nature brought him to the door of death?</li>
  <li>No, Warwick, no; while life upholds this arm,</li>
  <li>This arm upholds the house of Lancaster.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WARWICK</li>
  <li class="number">And I the house of York.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING LEWIS XI</li>
  <li>Queen Margaret, Prince Edward, and Oxford,</li>
  <li>Vouchsafe, at our request, to stand aside,</li>
  <li>While I use further conference with Warwick.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">They stand aloof</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">QUEEN MARGARET</li>
  <li>Heavens grant that Warwick's words bewitch him not!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING LEWIS XI</li>
  <li class="number">Now Warwick, tell me, even upon thy conscience,</li>
  <li>Is Edward your true king? for I were loath</li>
  <li>To link with him that were not lawful chosen.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WARWICK</li>
  <li>Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING LEWIS XI</li>
  <li>But is he gracious in the people's eye?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WARWICK</li>
  <li class="number">The more that Henry was unfortunate.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING LEWIS XI</li>
  <li>Then further, all dissembling set aside,</li>
  <li>Tell me for truth the measure of his love</li>
  <li>Unto our sister Bona.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WARWICK</li>
  <li>Such it seems</li>
  <li class="number">As may beseem a monarch like himself.</li>
  <li>Myself have often heard him say and swear</li>
  <li>That this his love was an eternal plant,</li>
  <li>Whereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground,</li>
  <li>The leaves and fruit maintain'd with beauty's sun,</li>
  <li class="number">Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,</li>
  <li>Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING LEWIS XI</li>
  <li>Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BONA</li>
  <li>Your grant, or your denial, shall be mine:</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">To WARWICK</li>
  <li>Yet I confess that often ere this day,</li>
  <li class="number">When I have heard your king's desert recounted,</li>
  <li>Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING LEWIS XI</li>
  <li>Then, Warwick, thus: our sister shall be Edward's;</li>
  <li>And now forthwith shall articles be drawn</li>
  <li>Touching the jointure that your king must make,</li>
  <li class="number">Which with her dowry shall be counterpoised.</li>
  <li>Draw near, Queen Margaret, and be a witness</li>
  <li>That Bona shall be wife to the English king.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE EDWARD</li>
  <li>To Edward, but not to the English king.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">QUEEN MARGARET</li>
  <li>Deceitful Warwick! it was thy device</li>
  <li class="number">By this alliance to make void my suit:</li>
  <li>Before thy coming Lewis was Henry's friend.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING LEWIS XI</li>
  <li>And still is friend to him and Margaret:</li>
  <li>But if your title to the crown be weak,</li>
  <li>As may appear by Edward's good success,</li>
  <li class="number">Then 'tis but reason that I be released</li>
  <li>From giving aid which late I promised.</li>
  <li>Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand</li>
  <li>That your estate requires and mine can yield.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WARWICK</li>
  <li>Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease,</li>
  <li class="number">Where having nothing, nothing can he lose.</li>
  <li>And as for you yourself, our quondam queen,</li>
  <li>You have a father able to maintain you;</li>
  <li>And better 'twere you troubled him than France.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">QUEEN MARGARET</li>
  <li>Peace, impudent and shameless Warwick, peace,</li>
  <li class="number">Proud setter up and puller down of kings!</li>
  <li>I will not hence, till, with my talk and tears,</li>
  <li>Both full of truth, I make King Lewis behold</li>
  <li>Thy sly conveyance and thy lord's false love;</li>
  <li>For both of you are birds of selfsame feather.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING LEWIS XI</li>
  <li>What! has your king married the Lady Grey!</li>
  <li>And now, to soothe your forgery and his,</li>
  <li>Sends me a paper to persuade me patience?</li>
  <li class="number">Is this the alliance that he seeks with France?</li>
  <li>Dare he presume to scorn us in this manner?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">QUEEN MARGARET</li>
  <li>I told your majesty as much before:</li>
  <li>This proveth Edward's love and Warwick's honesty.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WARWICK</li>
  <li>King Lewis, I here protest, in sight of heaven,</li>
  <li class="number">And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss,</li>
  <li>That I am clear from this misdeed of Edward's,</li>
  <li>No more my king, for he dishonours me,</li>
  <li>But most himself, if he could see his shame.</li>
  <li>Did I forget that by the house of York</li>
  <li class="number">My father came untimely to his death?</li>
  <li>Did I let pass the abuse done to my niece?</li>
  <li>Did I impale him with the regal crown?</li>
  <li>Did I put Henry from his native right?</li>
  <li>And am I guerdon'd at the last with shame?</li>
  <li class="number">Shame on himself! for my desert is honour:</li>
  <li>And to repair my honour lost for him,</li>
  <li>I here renounce him and return to Henry.</li>
  <li>My noble queen, let former grudges pass,</li>
  <li>And henceforth I am thy true servitor:</li>
  <li class="number">I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona,</li>
  <li>And replant Henry in his former state.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">QUEEN MARGARET</li>
  <li>Warwick, these words have turn'd my hate to love;</li>
  <li>And I forgive and quite forget old faults,</li>
  <li>And joy that thou becomest King Henry's friend.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WARWICK</li>
  <li class="number">So much his friend, ay, his unfeigned friend,</li>
  <li>That, if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us</li>
  <li>With some few bands of chosen soldiers,</li>
  <li>I'll undertake to land them on our coast</li>
  <li>And force the tyrant from his seat by war.</li>
  <li class="number">'Tis not his new-made bride shall succor him:</li>
  <li>And as for Clarence, as my letters tell me,</li>
  <li>He's very likely now to fall from him,</li>
  <li>For matching more for wanton lust than honour,</li>
  <li>Or than for strength and safety of our country.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BONA</li>
  <li class="number">Dear brother, how shall Bona be revenged</li>
  <li>But by thy help to this distressed queen?</li>

  <li>Renowned prince, how shall poor Henry live,</li>
  <li>Unless thou rescue him from foul despair?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">

  <li>My quarrel and this English queen's are one.</li>

  <li class="speaker">KING LEWIS XI</li>

  <li>Thou seest what's past, go fear thy king withal.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BONA</li>

  <li>Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING EDWARD IV</li>
  <li>Now, brother of Clarence, how like you our choice,</li>
  <li class="number">That you stand pensive, as half malcontent?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CLARENCE</li>
  <li>As well as Lewis of France, or the Earl of Warwick,</li>
  <li>Which are so weak of courage and in judgment</li>
  <li>That they'll take no offence at our abuse.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING EDWARD IV</li>
  <li>Suppose they take offence without a cause,</li>
  <li class="number">They are but Lewis and Warwick: I am Edward,</li>
  <li>Your king and Warwick's, and must have my will.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>And shall have your will, because our king:</li>
  <li>Yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING EDWARD IV</li>
  <li>Yea, brother Richard, are you offended too?</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li class="number">Not I:</li>
  <li>No, God forbid that I should wish them sever'd</li>
  <li>Whom God hath join'd together; ay, and 'twere pity</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING EDWARD IV</li>
  <li>Setting your scorns and your mislike aside,</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CLARENCE</li>
  <li>Then this is mine opinion: that King Lewis</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>And Warwick, doing what you gave in charge,</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING EDWARD IV</li>
  <li>What if both Lewis and Warwick be appeased</li>
  <li class="number">By such invention as I can devise?</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MONTAGUE</li>
  <li>Yet, to have join'd with France in such alliance</li>

  <li>But the safer when 'tis back'd with France.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HASTINGS</li>
  <li>'Tis better using France than trusting France:</li>
  <li>Let us be back'd with God and with the seas</li>

  <li class="speaker">KING EDWARD IV</li>
  <li>Ay, what of that? it was my will and grant;</li>
  <li class="number">And for this once my will shall stand for law.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>And yet methinks your grace hath not done well,</li>
  <li>To give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales</li>

  <li class="number">But in your bride you bury brotherhood.</li>

  <li>In choosing for yourself, you show'd your judgment,</li>

  <li>My lords, before it pleased his majesty</li>

  <li class="number">Ah, who is nigh? come to me, friend or foe,</li>

  <li>My blood, my want of strength, my sick heart shows.</li>
  <li>That I must yield my body to the earth</li>
  <li class="number">And, by my fall, the conquest to my foe.</li>
  <li>Thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge,</li>

  <li>Whose top-branch overpeer'd Jove's spreading tree</li>
  <li class="number">And kept low shrubs from winter's powerful wind.</li>
  <li>These eyes, that now are dimm'd with death's black veil,</li>
  <li>Have been as piercing as the mid-day sun,</li>
  <li>To search the secret treasons of the world:</li>
  <li>The wrinkles in my brows, now filled with blood,</li>
  <li class="number">Were liken'd oft to kingly sepulchres;</li>
  <li>For who lived king, but I could dig his grave?</li>
  <li>And who durst mine when Warwick bent his brow?</li>
  <li>Lo, now my glory smear'd in dust and blood!</li>
  <li>My parks, my walks, my manors that I had.</li>
  <li class="number">Even now forsake me, and of all my lands</li>
  <li>Is nothing left me but my body's length.</li>
  <li>Why, what is pomp, rule, reign, but earth and dust?</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">QUEEN MARGARET</li>
  <li>Great lords, wise men ne'er sit and wail their loss,</li>
  <li>But cheerly seek how to redress their harms.</li>
  <li>What though the mast be now blown overboard,</li>
  <li>The cable broke, the holding-anchor lost,</li>
  <li class="number">And half our sailors swallow'd in the flood?</li>
  <li>Yet lives our pilot still. Is't meet that he</li>
  <li>Should leave the helm and like a fearful lad</li>
  <li>With tearful eyes add water to the sea</li>
  <li>And give more strength to that which hath too much,</li>
  <li class="number">Whiles, in his moan, the ship splits on the rock,</li>
  <li>Which industry and courage might have saved?</li>
  <li>Ah, what a shame! ah, what a fault were this!</li>
  <li>Say Warwick was our anchor; what of that?</li>
  <li>And Montague our topmost; what of him?</li>
  <li class="number">Our slaughter'd friends the tackles; what of these?</li>
  <li>Why, is not Oxford here another anchor?</li>
  <li>And Somerset another goodly mast?</li>
  <li>The friends of France our shrouds and tacklings?</li>
  <li>And, though unskilful, why not Ned and I</li>
  <li class="number">For once allow'd the skilful pilot's charge?</li>
  <li>We will not from the helm to sit and weep,</li>
  <li>But keep our course, though the rough wind say no,</li>
  <li>From shelves and rocks that threaten us with wreck.</li>
  <li>As good to chide the waves as speak them fair.</li>
  <li class="number">And what is Edward but ruthless sea?</li>
  <li>What Clarence but a quicksand of deceit?</li>
  <li>And Richard but a ragged fatal rock?</li>
  <li>All these the enemies to our poor bark.</li>
  <li>Say you can swim; alas, 'tis but a while!</li>
  <li class="number">Tread on the sand; why, there you quickly sink:</li>
  <li>Bestride the rock; the tide will wash you off,</li>
  <li>Or else you famish; that's a threefold death.</li>
  <li>This speak I, lords, to let you understand,</li>
  <li>If case some one of you would fly from us,</li>
  <li class="number">That there's no hoped-for mercy with the brothers</li>
  <li>More than with ruthless waves, with sands and rocks.</li>
  <li>Why, courage then! what cannot be avoided</li>
  <li>'Twere childish weakness to lament or fear.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE EDWARD</li>
  <li>Methinks a woman of this valiant spirit</li>

  <li>And make him, naked, foil a man at arms.</li>
  <li>I speak not this as doubting any here</li>
  <li>For did I but suspect a fearful man</li>
  <li class="number">He should have leave to go away betimes,</li>
  <li>Lest in our need he might infect another</li>

  <li>A persecutor, I am sure, thou art:</li>

  <li>Thy son I kill'd for his presumption.</li>

  <li class="speaker">KING HENRY VI</li>
  <li class="number">Hadst thou been kill'd when first thou didst presume,</li>
  <li>Thou hadst not lived to kill a son of mine.</li>
  <li>And thus I prophesy, that many a thousand,</li>
  <li>Which now mistrust no parcel of my fear,</li>
  <li>And many an old man's sigh and many a widow's,</li>
  <li class="number">And many an orphan's water-standing eye â€” </li>
  <li>Men for their sons, wives for their husbands,</li>
  <li>And orphans for their parents timeless death â€” </li>

  <li>The owl shriek'd at thy birth â€”  an evil sign;</li>
  <li class="number">The night-crow cried, aboding luckless time;</li>
  <li>Dogs howl'd, and hideous tempest shook down trees;</li>
  <li>The raven rook'd her on the chimney's top,</li>
  <li>And chattering pies in dismal discords sung.</li>
  <li>Thy mother felt more than a mother's pain,</li>
  <li class="number">And, yet brought forth less than a mother's hope,</li>
  <li>To wit, an indigested and deformed lump,</li>
  <li>Not like the fruit of such a goodly tree.</li>
  <li>Teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born,</li>
  <li>To signify thou camest to bite the world:</li>

  <li>What, will the aspiring blood of Lancaster</li>

  <li>See how my sword weeps for the poor king's death!</li>
  <li>O, may such purple tears be alway shed</li>
  <li class="number">From those that wish the downfall of our house!</li>
  <li>If any spark of life be yet remaining,</li>
  <li>Down, down to hell; and say I sent thee thither:</li>

  <li>I, that have neither pity, love, nor fear.</li>
  <li>Indeed, 'tis true that Henry told me of;</li>
  <li class="number">For I have often heard my mother say</li>
  <li>I came into the world with my legs forward:</li>
  <li>Had I not reason, think ye, to make haste,</li>
  <li>And seek their ruin that usurp'd our right?</li>
  <li>The midwife wonder'd and the women cried</li>
  <li class="number">'O, Jesus bless us, he is born with teeth!'</li>
  <li>And so I was; which plainly signified</li>
  <li>That I should snarl and bite and play the dog.</li>
  <li>Then, since the heavens have shaped my body so,</li>
  <li>Let hell make crook'd my mind to answer it.</li>
  <li class="number">I have no brother, I am like no brother;</li>
  <li>And this word 'love,' which graybeards call divine,</li>

  <li>And not in me: I am myself alone.</li>
  <li>Clarence, beware; thou keep'st me from the light:</li>
  <li class="number">But I will sort a pitchy day for thee;</li>
  <li>For I will buz abroad such prophecies</li>
  <li>That Edward shall be fearful of his life,</li>
  <li>And then, to purge his fear, I'll be thy death.</li>
  <li>King Henry and the prince his son are gone:</li>
  <li class="number">Clarence, thy turn is next, and then the rest,</li>
  <li>Counting myself but bad till I be best.</li>
  <li>I'll throw thy body in another room</li>

<h3>SCENE VII.  London. The palace.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV, QUEEN ELIZABETH,
CLARENCE, GLOUCESTER, HASTINGS, a Nurse with the
young Prince, and Attendants</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING EDWARD IV</li>
  <li>Once more we sit in England's royal throne,</li>
  <li>Re-purchased with the blood of enemies.</li>
  <li>What valiant foemen, like to autumn's corn,</li>
  <li>Have we mow'd down, in tops of all their pride!</li>
  <li class="number">Three Dukes of Somerset, threefold renown'd</li>
  <li>For hardy and undoubted champions;</li>
  <li>Two Cliffords, as the father and the son,</li>
  <li>And two Northumberlands; two braver men</li>
  <li>Ne'er spurr'd their coursers at the trumpet's sound;</li>
  <li class="number">With them, the two brave bears, Warwick and Montague,</li>
  <li>That in their chains fetter'd the kingly lion</li>
  <li>And made the forest tremble when they roar'd.</li>
  <li>Thus have we swept suspicion from our seat</li>
  <li>And made our footstool of security.</li>
  <li class="number">Come hither, Bess, and let me kiss my boy.</li>
  <li>Young Ned, for thee, thine uncles and myself</li>
  <li>Have in our armours watch'd the winter's night,</li>
  <li>Went all afoot in summer's scalding heat,</li>
  <li>That thou mightst repossess the crown in peace;</li>
  <li class="number">And of our labours thou shalt reap the gain.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>Aside  I'll blast his harvest, if your head were laid;</li>
  <li>For yet I am not look'd on in the world.</li>
  <li>This shoulder was ordain'd so thick to heave;</li>
  <li>And heave it shall some weight, or break my back:</li>
  <li class="number">Work thou the way â€”  and thou shalt execute.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING EDWARD IV</li>
  <li>Clarence and Gloucester, love my lovely queen;</li>
  <li>And kiss your princely nephew, brothers both.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CLARENCE</li>
  <li>The duty that I owe unto your majesty</li>
  <li>I seal upon the lips of this sweet babe.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">QUEEN ELIZABETH</li>
  <li class="number">Thanks, noble Clarence; worthy brother, thanks.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>And, that I love the tree from whence thou sprang'st,</li>
  <li>Witness the loving kiss I give the fruit.</li>
  <li>Aside  To say the truth, so Judas kiss'd his master,</li>
  <li>And cried 'all hail!' when as he meant all harm.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING EDWARD IV</li>
  <li class="number">Now am I seated as my soul delights,</li>
  <li>Having my country's peace and brothers' loves.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CLARENCE</li>
  <li>What will your grace have done with Margaret?</li>
  <li>Reignier, her father, to the king of France</li>
  <li>Hath pawn'd the Sicils and Jerusalem,</li>
  <li class="number">And hither have they sent it for her ransom.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING EDWARD IV</li>
  <li>Away with her, and waft her hence to France.</li>
  <li>And now what rests but that we spend the time</li>
  <li>With stately triumphs, mirthful comic shows,</li>
  <li>Such as befits the pleasure of the court?</li>
  <li class="number">Sound drums and trumpets! farewell sour annoy!</li>
  <li>For here, I hope, begins our lasting joy.</li>
