<h3>SCENE I.  London. KING RICHARD II's palace.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter KING RICHARD II, JOHN OF GAUNT, with other
Nobles and Attendants</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING RICHARD II</li>
  <li>Old John of Gaunt, time-honour'd Lancaster,</li>
  <li>Hast thou, according to thy oath and band,</li>
  <li>Brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son,</li>
  <li>Here to make good the boisterous late appeal,</li>
  <li class="number">Which then our leisure would not let us hear,</li>
  <li>Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">JOHN OF GAUNT</li>
  <li>I have, my liege.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING RICHARD II</li>
  <li>Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him,</li>
  <li>If he appeal the duke on ancient malice;</li>
  <li class="number">Or worthily, as a good subject should,</li>
  <li>On some known ground of treachery in him?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">JOHN OF GAUNT</li>
  <li>As near as I could sift him on that argument,</li>
  <li>On some apparent danger seen in him</li>
  <li>Aim'd at your highness, no inveterate malice.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING RICHARD II</li>
  <li class="number">Then call them to our presence; face to face,</li>
  <li>And frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hear</li>
  <li>The accuser and the accused freely speak:</li>
  <li>High-stomach'd are they both, and full of ire,</li>
  <li>In rage deaf as the sea, hasty as fire.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE and THOMAS MOWBRAY</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HENRY BOLINGBROKE</li>
  <li class="number">Many years of happy days befal</li>
  <li>My gracious sovereign, my most loving liege!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">THOMAS MOWBRAY</li>
  <li>Each day still better other's happiness;</li>
  <li>Until the heavens, envying earth's good hap,</li>
  <li>Add an immortal title to your crown!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING RICHARD II</li>
  <li class="number">We thank you both: yet one but flatters us,</li>
  <li>As well appeareth by the cause you come;</li>
  <li>Namely to appeal each other of high treason.</li>
  <li>Cousin of Hereford, what dost thou object</li>
  <li>Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HENRY BOLINGBROKE</li>
  <li class="number">First, heaven be the record to my speech!</li>
  <li>In the devotion of a subject's love,</li>
  <li>Tendering the precious safety of my prince,</li>
  <li>And free from other misbegotten hate,</li>
  <li>Come I appellant to this princely presence.</li>
  <li class="number">Now, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee,</li>
  <li>And mark my greeting well; for what I speak</li>
  <li>My body shall make good upon this earth,</li>
  <li>Or my divine soul answer it in heaven.</li>
  <li>Thou art a traitor and a miscreant,</li>
  <li class="number">Too good to be so and too bad to live,</li>
  <li>Since the more fair and crystal is the sky,</li>
  <li>The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly.</li>
  <li>Once more, the more to aggravate the note,</li>
  <li>With a foul traitor's name stuff I thy throat;</li>
  <li class="number">And wish, so please my sovereign, ere I move,</li>
  <li>What my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">THOMAS MOWBRAY</li>
  <li>Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal:</li>
  <li>'Tis not the trial of a woman's war,</li>
  <li>The bitter clamour of two eager tongues,</li>
  <li class="number">Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain;</li>
  <li>The blood is hot that must be cool'd for this:</li>
  <li>Yet can I not of such tame patience boast</li>
  <li>As to be hush'd and nought at all to say:</li>
  <li>First, the fair reverence of your highness curbs me</li>
  <li class="number">From giving reins and spurs to my free speech;</li>
  <li>Which else would post until it had return'd</li>
  <li>These terms of treason doubled down his throat.</li>
  <li>Setting aside his high blood's royalty,</li>
  <li>And let him be no kinsman to my liege,</li>
  <li class="number">I do defy him, and I spit at him;</li>
  <li>Call him a slanderous coward and a villain:</li>
  <li>Which to maintain I would allow him odds,</li>
  <li>And meet him, were I tied to run afoot</li>
  <li>Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps,</li>
  <li class="number">Or any other ground inhabitable,</li>
  <li>Where ever Englishman durst set his foot.</li>
  <li>Mean time let this defend my loyalty,</li>
  <li>By all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HENRY BOLINGBROKE</li>
  <li>Pale trembling coward, there I throw my gage,</li>
  <li class="number">Disclaiming here the kindred of the king,</li>
  <li>And lay aside my high blood's royalty,</li>
  <li>Which fear, not reverence, makes thee to except.</li>
  <li>If guilty dread have left thee so much strength</li>
  <li>As to take up mine honour's pawn, then stoop:</li>
  <li class="number">By that and all the rites of knighthood else,</li>
  <li>Will I make good against thee, arm to arm,</li>
  <li>What I have spoke, or thou canst worse devise.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">THOMAS MOWBRAY</li>
  <li>I take it up; and by that sword I swear</li>
  <li>Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder,</li>
  <li class="number">I'll answer thee in any fair degree,</li>
  <li>Or chivalrous design of knightly trial:</li>
  <li>And when I mount, alive may I not light,</li>
  <li>If I be traitor or unjustly fight!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING RICHARD II</li>
  <li>What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray's charge?</li>
  <li class="number">It must be great that can inherit us</li>
  <li>So much as of a thought of ill in him.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HENRY BOLINGBROKE</li>
  <li>Look, what I speak, my life shall prove it true;</li>
  <li>That Mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles</li>
  <li>In name of lendings for your highness' soldiers,</li>
  <li class="number">The which he hath detain'd for lewd employments,</li>
  <li>Like a false traitor and injurious villain.</li>
  <li>Besides I say and will in battle prove,</li>
  <li>Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge</li>
  <li>That ever was survey'd by English eye,</li>
  <li class="number">That all the treasons for these eighteen years</li>
  <li>Complotted and contrived in this land</li>
  <li>Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring.</li>
  <li>Further I say and further will maintain</li>
  <li>Upon his bad life to make all this good,</li>
  <li class="number">That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester's death,</li>
  <li>Suggest his soon-believing adversaries,</li>
  <li>And consequently, like a traitor coward,</li>
  <li>Sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood:</li>
  <li>Which blood, like sacrificing Abel's, cries,</li>
  <li class="number">Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth,</li>
  <li>To me for justice and rough chastisement;</li>
  <li>And, by the glorious worth of my descent,</li>
  <li>This arm shall do it, or this life be spent.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING RICHARD II</li>
  <li>How high a pitch his resolution soars!</li>
  <li class="number">Thomas of Norfolk, what say'st thou to this?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">THOMAS MOWBRAY</li>
  <li>O, let my sovereign turn away his face</li>
  <li>And bid his ears a little while be deaf,</li>
  <li>Till I have told this slander of his blood,</li>
  <li>How God and good men hate so foul a liar.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING RICHARD II</li>
  <li class="number">Mowbray, impartial are our eyes and ears:</li>
  <li>Were he my brother, nay, my kingdom's heir,</li>
  <li>As he is but my father's brother's son,</li>
  <li>Now, by my sceptre's awe, I make a vow,</li>
  <li>Such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood</li>
  <li class="number">Should nothing privilege him, nor partialize</li>
  <li>The unstooping firmness of my upright soul:</li>
  <li>He is our subject, Mowbray; so art thou:</li>
  <li>Free speech and fearless I to thee allow.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">THOMAS MOWBRAY</li>
  <li>Then, Bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart,</li>
  <li class="number">Through the false passage of thy throat, thou liest.</li>
  <li>Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais</li>
  <li>Disbursed I duly to his highness' soldiers;</li>
  <li>The other part reserved I by consent,</li>
  <li>For that my sovereign liege was in my debt</li>
  <li class="number">Upon remainder of a dear account,</li>
  <li>Since last I went to France to fetch his queen:</li>
  <li>Now swallow down that lie. For Gloucester's death,</li>
  <li>I slew him not; but to my own disgrace</li>
  <li>Neglected my sworn duty in that case.</li>
  <li class="number">For you, my noble Lord of Lancaster,</li>
  <li>The honourable father to my foe</li>
  <li>Once did I lay an ambush for your life,</li>
  <li>A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul</li>
  <li>But ere I last received the sacrament</li>
  <li class="number">I did confess it, and exactly begg'd</li>
  <li>Your grace's pardon, and I hope I had it.</li>
  <li>This is my fault: as for the rest appeall'd,</li>
  <li>It issues from the rancour of a villain,</li>
  <li>A recreant and most degenerate traitor</li>
  <li class="number">Which in myself I boldly will defend;</li>
  <li>And interchangeably hurl down my gage</li>
  <li>Upon this overweening traitor's foot,</li>
  <li>To prove myself a loyal gentleman</li>
  <li>Even in the best blood chamber'd in his bosom.</li>
  <li class="number">In haste whereof, most heartily I pray</li>
  <li>Your highness to assign our trial day.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING RICHARD II</li>
  <li>Wrath-kindled gentlemen, be ruled by me;</li>
  <li>Let's purge this choler without letting blood:</li>
  <li>This we prescribe, though no physician;</li>
  <li class="number">Deep malice makes too deep incision;</li>
  <li>Forget, forgive; conclude and be agreed;</li>
  <li>Our doctors say this is no month to bleed.</li>
  <li>Good uncle, let this end where it begun;</li>
  <li>We'll calm the Duke of Norfolk, you your son.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">JOHN OF GAUNT</li>
  <li class="number">To be a make-peace shall become my age:</li>
  <li>Throw down, my son, the Duke of Norfolk's gage.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING RICHARD II</li>
  <li>And, Norfolk, throw down his.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">JOHN OF GAUNT</li>
  <li>When, Harry, when?</li>
  <li>Obedience bids I should not bid again.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING RICHARD II</li>
  <li class="number">Norfolk, throw down, we bid; there is no boot.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">THOMAS MOWBRAY</li>
  <li>Myself I throw, dread sovereign, at thy foot.</li>
  <li>My life thou shalt command, but not my shame:</li>
  <li>The one my duty owes; but my fair name,</li>
  <li>Despite of death that lives upon my grave,</li>
  <li class="number">To dark dishonour's use thou shalt not have.</li>
  <li>I am disgraced, impeach'd and baffled here,</li>
  <li>Pierced to the soul with slander's venom'd spear,</li>
  <li>The which no balm can cure but his heart-blood</li>
  <li>Which breathed this poison.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING RICHARD II</li>
  <li class="number">Rage must be withstood:</li>
  <li>Give me his gage: lions make leopards tame.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">THOMAS MOWBRAY</li>
  <li>Yea, but not change his spots: take but my shame.</li>
  <li>And I resign my gage. My dear dear lord,</li>
  <li>The purest treasure mortal times afford</li>
  <li class="number">Is spotless reputation: that away,</li>
  <li>Men are but gilded loam or painted clay.</li>
  <li>A jewel in a ten-times-barr'd-up chest</li>
  <li>Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast.</li>
  <li>Mine honour is my life; both grow in one:</li>
  <li class="number">Take honour from me, and my life is done:</li>
  <li>Then, dear my liege, mine honour let me try;</li>
  <li>In that I live and for that will I die.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING RICHARD II</li>
  <li>Cousin, throw up your gage; do you begin.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HENRY BOLINGBROKE</li>
  <li>O, God defend my soul from such deep sin!</li>
  <li class="number">Shall I seem crest-fall'n in my father's sight?</li>
  <li>Or with pale beggar-fear impeach my height</li>
  <li>Before this out-dared dastard? Ere my tongue</li>
  <li>Shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong,</li>
  <li>Or sound so base a parle, my teeth shall tear</li>
  <li class="number">The slavish motive of recanting fear,</li>
  <li>And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,</li>
  <li>Where shame doth harbour, even in Mowbray's face.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit JOHN OF GAUNT</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING RICHARD II</li>
  <li>We were not born to sue, but to command;</li>
  <li>Which since we cannot do to make you friends,</li>
  <li class="number">Be ready, as your lives shall answer it,</li>
  <li>At Coventry, upon Saint Lambert's day:</li>
  <li>There shall your swords and lances arbitrate</li>
  <li>The swelling difference of your settled hate:</li>
  <li>Since we can not atone you, we shall see</li>

<h3>SCENE II.  The DUKE OF LANCASTER'S palace.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter JOHN OF GAUNT with DUCHESS</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">JOHN OF GAUNT</li>
  <li>Alas, the part I had in Woodstock's blood</li>
  <li>Doth more solicit me than your exclaims,</li>
  <li>To stir against the butchers of his life!</li>
  <li>But since correction lieth in those hands</li>
  <li class="number">Which made the fault that we cannot correct,</li>
  <li>Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven;</li>
  <li>Who, when they see the hours ripe on earth,</li>
  <li>Will rain hot vengeance on offenders' heads.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DUCHESS</li>
  <li>Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur?</li>
  <li class="number">Hath love in thy old blood no living fire?</li>
  <li>Edward's seven sons, whereof thyself art one,</li>
  <li>Were as seven vials of his sacred blood,</li>
  <li>Or seven fair branches springing from one root:</li>
  <li>Some of those seven are dried by nature's course,</li>
  <li class="number">Some of those branches by the Destinies cut;</li>
  <li>But Thomas, my dear lord, my life, my Gloucester,</li>
  <li>One vial full of Edward's sacred blood,</li>
  <li>One flourishing branch of his most royal root,</li>
  <li>Is crack'd, and all the precious liquor spilt,</li>
  <li class="number">Is hack'd down, and his summer leaves all faded,</li>
  <li>By envy's hand and murder's bloody axe.</li>
  <li>Ah, Gaunt, his blood was thine! that bed, that womb,</li>
  <li>That metal, that self-mould, that fashion'd thee</li>
  <li>Made him a man; and though thou livest and breathest,</li>
  <li class="number">Yet art thou slain in him: thou dost consent</li>
  <li>In some large measure to thy father's death,</li>
  <li>In that thou seest thy wretched brother die,</li>
  <li>Who was the model of thy father's life.</li>
  <li>Call it not patience, Gaunt; it is despair:</li>
  <li class="number">In suffering thus thy brother to be slaughter'd,</li>
  <li>Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life,</li>
  <li>Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee:</li>
  <li>That which in mean men we intitle patience</li>
  <li>Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.</li>
  <li class="number">What shall I say? to safeguard thine own life,</li>
  <li>The best way is to venge my Gloucester's death.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">JOHN OF GAUNT</li>
  <li>God's is the quarrel; for God's substitute,</li>
  <li>His deputy anointed in His sight,</li>
  <li>Hath caused his death: the which if wrongfully,</li>

  <li>An angry arm against His minister.</li>

  <li>To God, the widow's champion and defence.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DUCHESS</li>
  <li>Why, then, I will. Farewell, old Gaunt.</li>
  <li class="number">Thou goest to Coventry, there to behold</li>
  <li>Our cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight:</li>
  <li>O, sit my husband's wrongs on Hereford's spear,</li>
  <li>That it may enter butcher Mowbray's breast!</li>
  <li>Or, if misfortune miss the first career,</li>
  <li class="number">Be Mowbray's sins so heavy in his bosom,</li>
  <li>They may break his foaming courser's back,</li>
  <li>And throw the rider headlong in the lists,</li>
  <li>A caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford!</li>
  <li>Farewell, old Gaunt: thy sometimes brother's wife</li>
  <li class="number">With her companion grief must end her life.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">JOHN OF GAUNT</li>
  <li>Sister, farewell; I must to Coventry:</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DUCHESS</li>
  <li>Yet one word more: grief boundeth where it falls,</li>
  <li>Not with the empty hollowness, but weight:</li>
  <li class="number">I take my leave before I have begun,</li>
  <li>For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done.</li>
  <li>Commend me to thy brother, Edmund York.</li>
  <li>Lo, this is all: â€” nay, yet depart not so;</li>
  <li>Though this be all, do not so quickly go;</li>
  <li class="number">I shall remember more. Bid him â€” ah, what? â€” </li>
  <li>With all good speed at Plashy visit me.</li>
  <li>Alack, and what shall good old York there see</li>
  <li>But empty lodgings and unfurnish'd walls,</li>
  <li>Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?</li>
  <li class="number">And what hear there for welcome but my groans?</li>
  <li>Therefore commend me; let him not come there,</li>
  <li>To seek out sorrow that dwells every where.</li>
  <li>Desolate, desolate, will I hence and die:</li>
  <li>The last leave of thee takes my weeping eye.</li>

  <li>The language I have learn'd these forty years,</li>

<h3>SCENE I.  Ely House.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter JOHN OF GAUNT sick, with the DUKE OF YORK,
etc.</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">JOHN OF GAUNT</li>
  <li>Will the king come, that I may breathe my last</li>
  <li>In wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DUKE OF YORK</li>
  <li>Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;</li>
  <li>For all in vain comes counsel to his ear.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">JOHN OF GAUNT</li>
  <li class="number">O, but they say the tongues of dying men</li>
  <li>Enforce attention like deep harmony:</li>
  <li>Where words are scarce, they are seldom spent in vain,</li>
  <li>For they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain.</li>
  <li>He that no more must say is listen'd more</li>
  <li class="number">Than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose;</li>
  <li>More are men's ends mark'd than their lives before:</li>
  <li>The setting sun, and music at the close,</li>
  <li>As the last taste of sweets, is sweetest last,</li>
  <li>Writ in remembrance more than things long past:</li>
  <li class="number">Though Richard my life's counsel would not hear,</li>
  <li>My death's sad tale may yet undeaf his ear.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DUKE OF YORK</li>
  <li>No; it is stopp'd with other flattering sounds,</li>
  <li>As praises, of whose taste the wise are fond,</li>
  <li>Lascivious metres, to whose venom sound</li>
  <li class="number">The open ear of youth doth always listen;</li>
  <li>Report of fashions in proud Italy,</li>
  <li>Whose manners still our tardy apish nation</li>
  <li>Limps after in base imitation.</li>
  <li>Where doth the world thrust forth a vanity â€” </li>
  <li class="number">So it be new, there's no respect how vile â€” </li>
  <li>That is not quickly buzzed into his ears?</li>
  <li>Then all too late comes counsel to be heard,</li>
  <li>Where will doth mutiny with wit's regard.</li>
  <li>Direct not him whose way himself will choose:</li>
  <li class="number">'Tis breath thou lack'st, and that breath wilt thou lose.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">JOHN OF GAUNT</li>
  <li>Methinks I am a prophet new inspired</li>
  <li>And thus expiring do foretell of him:</li>
  <li>His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last,</li>
  <li>For violent fires soon burn out themselves;</li>
  <li class="number">Small showers last long, but sudden storms are short;</li>
  <li>He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes;</li>
  <li>With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder:</li>
  <li>Light vanity, insatiate cormorant,</li>
  <li>Consuming means, soon preys upon itself.</li>
  <li class="number">This royal throne of kings, this scepter'd isle,</li>
  <li>This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,</li>
  <li>This other Eden, demi-paradise,</li>
  <li>This fortress built by Nature for herself</li>
  <li>Against infection and the hand of war,</li>
  <li class="number">This happy breed of men, this little world,</li>
  <li>This precious stone set in the silver sea,</li>
  <li>Which serves it in the office of a wall,</li>
  <li>Or as a moat defensive to a house,</li>
  <li>Against the envy of less happier lands,</li>
  <li class="number">This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England,</li>
  <li>This nurse, this teeming womb of royal kings,</li>
  <li>Fear'd by their breed and famous by their birth,</li>
  <li>Renowned for their deeds as far from home,</li>
  <li>For Christian service and true chivalry,</li>
  <li class="number">As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry,</li>
  <li>Of the world's ransom, blessed Mary's Son,</li>
  <li>This land of such dear souls, this dear dear land,</li>
  <li>Dear for her reputation through the world,</li>
  <li>Is now leased out, I die pronouncing it,</li>
  <li class="number">Like to a tenement or pelting farm:</li>
  <li>England, bound in with the triumphant sea</li>
  <li>Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege</li>
  <li>Of watery Neptune, is now bound in with shame,</li>
  <li>With inky blots and rotten parchment bonds:</li>
  <li class="number">That England, that was wont to conquer others,</li>
  <li>Hath made a shameful conquest of itself.</li>
  <li>Ah, would the scandal vanish with my life,</li>
  <li>How happy then were my ensuing death!</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">JOHN OF GAUNT</li>
  <li>O how that name befits my composition!</li>
  <li>Old Gaunt indeed, and gaunt in being old:</li>
  <li class="number">Within me grief hath kept a tedious fast;</li>
  <li>And who abstains from meat that is not gaunt?</li>
  <li>For sleeping England long time have I watch'd;</li>
  <li>Watching breeds leanness, leanness is all gaunt:</li>
  <li>The pleasure that some fathers feed upon,</li>
  <li class="number">Is my strict fast; I mean, my children's looks;</li>
  <li>And therein fasting, hast thou made me gaunt:</li>
  <li>Gaunt am I for the grave, gaunt as a grave,</li>
  <li>Whose hollow womb inherits nought but bones.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING RICHARD II</li>
  <li>Can sick men play so nicely with their names?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">JOHN OF GAUNT</li>
  <li class="number">No, misery makes sport to mock itself:</li>
  <li>Since thou dost seek to kill my name in me,</li>
  <li>I mock my name, great king, to flatter thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING RICHARD II</li>

  <li>Now He that made me knows I see thee ill;</li>
  <li>Ill in myself to see, and in thee seeing ill.</li>
  <li class="number">Thy death-bed is no lesser than thy land</li>
  <li>Wherein thou liest in reputation sick;</li>

  <li>Whose compass is no bigger than thy head;</li>
  <li>And yet, incaged in so small a verge,</li>
  <li>The waste is no whit lesser than thy land.</li>
  <li>O, had thy grandsire with a prophet's eye</li>
  <li class="number">Seen how his son's son should destroy his sons,</li>
  <li>From forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame,</li>
  <li>Deposing thee before thou wert possess'd,</li>
  <li>Which art possess'd now to depose thyself.</li>
  <li>Why, cousin, wert thou regent of the world,</li>
  <li class="number">It were a shame to let this land by lease;</li>
  <li>But for thy world enjoying but this land,</li>
  <li>Is it not more than shame to shame it so?</li>
  <li>Landlord of England art thou now, not king:</li>
  <li>Thy state of law is bondslave to the law; And thou â€” </li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING RICHARD II</li>
  <li class="number">A lunatic lean-witted fool,</li>
  <li>Presuming on an ague's privilege,</li>
  <li>Darest with thy frozen admonition</li>

  <li>With fury from his native residence.</li>
  <li class="number">Now, by my seat's right royal majesty,</li>
  <li>Wert thou not brother to great Edward's son,</li>

  <li class="speaker">JOHN OF GAUNT</li>
  <li>O, spare me not, my brother Edward's son,</li>

  <li>That blood already, like the pelican,</li>

  <li>Whom fair befal in heaven 'mongst happy souls!</li>
  <li class="number">May be a precedent and witness good</li>
  <li>That thou respect'st not spilling Edward's blood:</li>
  <li>Join with the present sickness that I have;</li>
  <li>And thy unkindness be like crooked age,</li>
  <li>To crop at once a too long wither'd flower.</li>
  <li class="number">Live in thy shame, but die not shame with thee!</li>

  <li>Nay, nothing; all is said</li>

  <li class="speaker">DUKE OF YORK</li>
  <li>Be York the next that must be bankrupt so!</li>

  <li>The ripest fruit first falls, and so doth he;</li>
  <li class="number">His time is spent, our pilgrimage must be.</li>
  <li>So much for that. Now for our Irish wars:</li>
  <li>We must supplant those rough rug-headed kerns,</li>

  <li>But only they have privilege to live.</li>
  <li class="number">And for these great affairs do ask some charge,</li>

  <li class="speaker">DUKE OF YORK</li>
  <li>How long shall I be patient? ah, how long</li>

  <li>Not Gloucester's death, nor Hereford's banishment</li>
  <li>Not Gaunt's rebukes, nor England's private wrongs,</li>

  <li>I am the last of noble Edward's sons,</li>

  <li>In war was never lion raged more fierce,</li>
  <li class="number">In peace was never gentle lamb more mild,</li>
  <li>Than was that young and princely gentleman.</li>
  <li>His face thou hast, for even so look'd he,</li>
  <li>Accomplish'd with the number of thy hours;</li>
  <li>But when he frown'd, it was against the French</li>

  <li>Which his triumphant father's hand had won;</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter QUEEN, BUSHY, and BAGOT</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BUSHY</li>
  <li>Madam, your majesty is too much sad:</li>
  <li>You promised, when you parted with the king,</li>
  <li>To lay aside life-harming heaviness</li>
  <li>And entertain a cheerful disposition.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">QUEEN</li>
  <li class="number">To please the king I did; to please myself</li>
  <li>I cannot do it; yet I know no cause</li>
  <li>Why I should welcome such a guest as grief,</li>
  <li>Save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest</li>
  <li>As my sweet Richard: yet again, methinks,</li>
  <li class="number">Some unborn sorrow, ripe in fortune's womb,</li>
  <li>Is coming towards me, and my inward soul</li>
  <li>With nothing trembles: at some thing it grieves,</li>
  <li>More than with parting from my lord the king.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BUSHY</li>
  <li>Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows,</li>
  <li class="number">Which shows like grief itself, but is not so;</li>
  <li>For sorrow's eye, glazed with blinding tears,</li>
  <li>Divides one thing entire to many objects;</li>
  <li>Like perspectives, which rightly gazed upon</li>
  <li>Show nothing but confusion, eyed awry</li>
  <li class="number">Distinguish form: so your sweet majesty,</li>
  <li>Looking awry upon your lord's departure,</li>
  <li>Find shapes of grief, more than himself, to wail;</li>
  <li>Which, look'd on as it is, is nought but shadows</li>
  <li>Of what it is not. Then, thrice-gracious queen,</li>
  <li class="number">More than your lord's departure weep not: more's not seen;</li>
  <li>Or if it be, 'tis with false sorrow's eye,</li>
  <li>Which for things true weeps things imaginary.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">QUEEN</li>
  <li>It may be so; but yet my inward soul</li>
  <li>Persuades me it is otherwise: howe'er it be,</li>
  <li class="number">I cannot but be sad; so heavy sad</li>
  <li>As, though on thinking on no thought I think,</li>
  <li>Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BUSHY</li>
  <li>'Tis nothing but conceit, my gracious lady.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">QUEEN</li>
  <li>'Tis nothing less: conceit is still derived</li>
  <li class="number">From some forefather grief; mine is not so,</li>
  <li>For nothing had begot my something grief;</li>
  <li>Or something hath the nothing that I grieve:</li>
  <li>'Tis in reversion that I do possess;</li>
  <li>But what it is, that is not yet known; what</li>
  <li class="number">I cannot name; 'tis nameless woe, I wot.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter GREEN</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GREEN</li>
  <li>God save your majesty! and well met, gentlemen:</li>
  <li>I hope the king is not yet shipp'd for Ireland.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">QUEEN</li>
  <li>Why hopest thou so? 'tis better hope he is;</li>
  <li>For his designs crave haste, his haste good hope:</li>
  <li class="number">Then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipp'd?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GREEN</li>
  <li>That he, our hope, might have retired his power,</li>
  <li>And driven into despair an enemy's hope,</li>
  <li>Who strongly hath set footing in this land:</li>
  <li>The banish'd Bolingbroke repeals himself,</li>
  <li class="number">And with uplifted arms is safe arrived</li>
  <li>At Ravenspurgh.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">QUEEN</li>
  <li>Now God in heaven forbid!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GREEN</li>
  <li>Ah, madam, 'tis too true: and that is worse,</li>
  <li>The Lord Northumberland, his son young Henry Percy,</li>
  <li class="number">The Lords of Ross, Beaumond, and Willoughby,</li>
  <li>With all their powerful friends, are fled to him.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BUSHY</li>
  <li>Why have you not proclaim'd Northumberland</li>
  <li>And all the rest revolted faction traitors?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GREEN</li>
  <li>We have: whereupon the Earl of Worcester</li>
  <li class="number">Hath broke his staff, resign'd his stewardship,</li>
  <li>And all the household servants fled with him</li>
  <li>To Bolingbroke.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">QUEEN</li>
  <li>So, Green, thou art the midwife to my woe,</li>
  <li>And Bolingbroke my sorrow's dismal heir:</li>
  <li class="number">Now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy,</li>
  <li>And I, a gasping new-deliver'd mother,</li>
  <li>Have woe to woe, sorrow to sorrow join'd.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BUSHY</li>
  <li>Despair not, madam.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">QUEEN</li>
  <li>Who shall hinder me?</li>
  <li class="number">I will despair, and be at enmity</li>
  <li>With cozening hope: he is a flatterer,</li>
  <li>A parasite, a keeper back of death,</li>
  <li>Who gently would dissolve the bands of life,</li>
  <li>Which false hope lingers in extremity.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter DUKE OF YORK</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GREEN</li>
  <li class="number">Here comes the Duke of York.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">QUEEN</li>
  <li>With signs of war about his aged neck:</li>
  <li>O, full of careful business are his looks!</li>
  <li>Uncle, for God's sake, speak comfortable words.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DUKE OF YORK</li>
  <li>Should I do so, I should belie my thoughts:</li>
  <li class="number">Comfort's in heaven; and we are on the earth,</li>
  <li>Where nothing lives but crosses, cares and grief.</li>
  <li>Your husband, he is gone to save far off,</li>
  <li>Whilst others come to make him lose at home:</li>
  <li>Here am I left to underprop his land,</li>
  <li class="number">Who, weak with age, cannot support myself:</li>
  <li>Now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made;</li>
  <li>Now shall he try his friends that flatter'd him.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter a Servant</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Servant</li>
  <li>My lord, your son was gone before I came.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DUKE OF YORK</li>
  <li>He was? Why, so! go all which way it will!</li>
  <li class="number">The nobles they are fled, the commons they are cold,</li>
  <li>And will, I fear, revolt on Hereford's side.</li>
  <li>Sirrah, get thee to Plashy, to my sister Gloucester;</li>
  <li>Bid her send me presently a thousand pound:</li>
  <li>Hold, take my ring.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Servant</li>
  <li class="number">My lord, I had forgot to tell your lordship,</li>
  <li>To-day, as I came by, I called there;</li>
  <li>But I shall grieve you to report the rest.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DUKE OF YORK</li>
  <li>What is't, knave?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Servant</li>
  <li>An hour before I came, the duchess died.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DUKE OF YORK</li>
  <li class="number">God for his mercy! what a tide of woes</li>
  <li>Comes rushing on this woeful land at once!</li>
  <li>I know not what to do: I would to God,</li>
  <li>So my untruth had not provoked him to it,</li>
  <li>The king had cut off my head with my brother's.</li>
  <li class="number">What, are there no posts dispatch'd for Ireland?</li>
  <li>How shall we do for money for these wars?</li>
  <li>Come, sister â€”  cousin, I would say â€” pray, pardon me.</li>
  <li>Go, fellow, get thee home, provide some carts</li>
  <li>And bring away the armour that is there.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Exit Servant</li>
  <li class="number">Gentlemen, will you go muster men?</li>
  <li>If I know how or which way to order these affairs</li>
  <li>Thus thrust disorderly into my hands,</li>
  <li>Never believe me. Both are my kinsmen:</li>
  <li>The one is my sovereign, whom both my oath</li>
  <li class="number">And duty bids defend; the other again</li>
  <li>Is my kinsman, whom the king hath wrong'd,</li>
  <li>Whom conscience and my kindred bids to right.</li>
  <li>Well, somewhat we must do. Come, cousin, I'll</li>
  <li>Dispose of you.</li>
  <li class="number">Gentlemen, go, muster up your men,</li>
  <li>And meet me presently at Berkeley.</li>
  <li>I should to Plashy too;</li>
  <li>But time will not permit: all is uneven,</li>
  <li>And every thing is left at six and seven.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt DUKE OF YORK and QUEEN</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BUSHY</li>
  <li class="number">The wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland,</li>
  <li>But none returns. For us to levy power</li>
  <li>Proportionable to the enemy</li>
  <li>Is all unpossible.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GREEN</li>
  <li>Besides, our nearness to the king in love</li>
  <li class="number">Is near the hate of those love not the king.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BAGOT</li>
  <li>And that's the wavering commons: for their love</li>
  <li>Lies in their purses, and whoso empties them</li>
  <li>By so much fills their hearts with deadly hate.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BUSHY</li>
  <li>Wherein the king stands generally condemn'd.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BAGOT</li>
  <li class="number">If judgement lie in them, then so do we,</li>
  <li>Because we ever have been near the king.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GREEN</li>
  <li>Well, I will for refuge straight to Bristol castle:</li>
  <li>The Earl of Wiltshire is already there.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BUSHY</li>
  <li>Thither will I with you; for little office</li>
  <li class="number">The hateful commons will perform for us,</li>
  <li>Except like curs to tear us all to pieces.</li>
  <li>Will you go along with us?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BAGOT</li>
  <li>No; I will to Ireland to his majesty.</li>
  <li>Farewell: if heart's presages be not vain,</li>
  <li class="number">We three here art that ne'er shall meet again.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BUSHY</li>
  <li>That's as York thrives to beat back Bolingbroke.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GREEN</li>
  <li>Alas, poor duke! the task he undertakes</li>
  <li>Is numbering sands and drinking oceans dry:</li>
  <li>Where one on his side fights, thousands will fly.</li>
  <li class="number">Farewell at once, for once, for all, and ever.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BUSHY</li>
  <li>Well, we may meet again.</li>

<h3>SCENE III.  Wilds in Gloucestershire.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE and NORTHUMBERLAND, with Forces</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HENRY BOLINGBROKE</li>
  <li>How far is it, my lord, to Berkeley now?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NORTHUMBERLAND</li>
  <li>Believe me, noble lord,</li>
  <li>I am a stranger here in Gloucestershire:</li>
  <li>These high wild hills and rough uneven ways</li>
  <li class="number">Draws out our miles, and makes them wearisome,</li>
  <li>And yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar,</li>
  <li>Making the hard way sweet and delectable.</li>
  <li>But I bethink me what a weary way</li>
  <li>From Ravenspurgh to Cotswold will be found</li>
  <li class="number">In Ross and Willoughby, wanting your company,</li>
  <li>Which, I protest, hath very much beguiled</li>
  <li>The tediousness and process of my travel:</li>
  <li>But theirs is sweetened with the hope to have</li>
  <li>The present benefit which I possess;</li>
  <li class="number">And hope to joy is little less in joy</li>
  <li>Than hope enjoy'd: by this the weary lords</li>
  <li>Shall make their way seem short, as mine hath done</li>
  <li>By sight of what I have, your noble company.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HENRY BOLINGBROKE</li>
  <li>Of much less value is my company</li>
  <li class="number">Than your good words. But who comes here?</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter HENRY PERCY</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NORTHUMBERLAND</li>
  <li>It is my son, young Harry Percy,</li>
  <li>Sent from my brother Worcester, whencesoever.</li>
  <li>Harry, how fares your uncle?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HENRY PERCY</li>
  <li>I had thought, my lord, to have learn'd his health of you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NORTHUMBERLAND</li>
  <li class="number">Why, is he not with the queen?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HENRY PERCY</li>
  <li>No, my good Lord; he hath forsook the court,</li>
  <li>Broken his staff of office and dispersed</li>
  <li>The household of the king.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NORTHUMBERLAND</li>
  <li>What was his reason?</li>
  <li class="number">He was not so resolved when last we spake together.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HENRY PERCY</li>
  <li>Because your lordship was proclaimed traitor.</li>
  <li>But he, my lord, is gone to Ravenspurgh,</li>
  <li>To offer service to the Duke of Hereford,</li>
  <li>And sent me over by Berkeley, to discover</li>
  <li class="number">What power the Duke of York had levied there;</li>
  <li>Then with directions to repair to Ravenspurgh.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NORTHUMBERLAND</li>
  <li>Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford, boy?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HENRY PERCY</li>
  <li>No, my good lord, for that is not forgot</li>
  <li>Which ne'er I did remember: to my knowledge,</li>
  <li class="number">I never in my life did look on him.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NORTHUMBERLAND</li>
  <li>Then learn to know him now; this is the duke.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HENRY PERCY</li>
  <li>My gracious lord, I tender you my service,</li>
  <li>Such as it is, being tender, raw and young:</li>
  <li>Which elder days shall ripen and confirm</li>
  <li class="number">To more approved service and desert.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HENRY BOLINGBROKE</li>
  <li>I thank thee, gentle Percy; and be sure</li>
  <li>I count myself in nothing else so happy</li>
  <li>As in a soul remembering my good friends;</li>
  <li>And, as my fortune ripens with thy love,</li>
  <li class="number">It shall be still thy true love's recompense:</li>
  <li>My heart this covenant makes, my hand thus seals it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NORTHUMBERLAND</li>
  <li>How far is it to Berkeley? and what stir</li>
  <li>Keeps good old York there with his men of war?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HENRY PERCY</li>
  <li>There stands the castle, by yon tuft of trees,</li>
  <li class="number">Mann'd with three hundred men, as I have heard;</li>
  <li>And in it are the Lords of York, Berkeley, and Seymour;</li>
  <li>None else of name and noble estimate.</li>

  <li class="speaker">HENRY BOLINGBROKE</li>
  <li class="number">Welcome, my lords. I wot your love pursues</li>
  <li>A banish'd traitor: all my treasury</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LORD ROSS</li>
  <li>Your presence makes us rich, most noble lord.</li>

  <li class="speaker">LORD BERKELEY</li>

  <li>The Duke of York, to know what pricks you on</li>

  <li class="speaker">DUKE OF YORK</li>
  <li>Tut, tut!</li>
  <li>Grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle:</li>
  <li>I am no traitor's uncle; and that word 'grace.'</li>

  <li>Why have those banish'd and forbidden legs</li>

  <li>But then more 'why?' why have they dared to march</li>
  <li>So many miles upon her peaceful bosom,</li>
  <li class="number">Frighting her pale-faced villages with war</li>
  <li>And ostentation of despised arms?</li>
  <li>Comest thou because the anointed king is hence?</li>
  <li>Why, foolish boy, the king is left behind,</li>

  <li class="number">Were I but now the lord of such hot youth</li>

  <li>O, then how quickly should this arm of mine.</li>
  <li class="number">Now prisoner to the palsy, chastise thee</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HENRY BOLINGBROKE</li>
  <li>My gracious uncle, let me know my fault:</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DUKE OF YORK</li>
  <li>Even in condition of the worst degree,</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HENRY BOLINGBROKE</li>
  <li>As I was banish'd, I was banish'd Hereford;</li>
  <li class="number">But as I come, I come for Lancaster.</li>
  <li>And, noble uncle, I beseech your grace</li>
  <li>Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye:</li>
  <li>You are my father, for methinks in you</li>
  <li>I see old Gaunt alive; O, then, my father,</li>
  <li class="number">Will you permit that I shall stand condemn'd</li>
  <li>A wandering vagabond; my rights and royalties</li>
  <li>Pluck'd from my arms perforce and given away</li>
  <li>To upstart unthrifts? Wherefore was I born?</li>
  <li>If that my cousin king be King of England,</li>
  <li class="number">It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster.</li>
  <li>You have a son, Aumerle, my noble cousin;</li>
  <li>Had you first died, and he been thus trod down,</li>
  <li>He should have found his uncle Gaunt a father,</li>
  <li>To rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay.</li>
  <li class="number">I am denied to sue my livery here,</li>
  <li>And yet my letters-patents give me leave:</li>
  <li>My father's goods are all distrain'd and sold,</li>
  <li>And these and all are all amiss employ'd.</li>
  <li>What would you have me do? I am a subject,</li>
  <li class="number">And I challenge law: attorneys are denied me;</li>
  <li>And therefore, personally I lay my claim</li>
  <li>To my inheritance of free descent.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NORTHUMBERLAND</li>

  <li>My lords of England, let me tell you this:</li>

  <li>But in this kind to come, in braving arms,</li>
  <li class="number">Be his own carver and cut out his way,</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NORTHUMBERLAND</li>

  <li class="speaker">DUKE OF YORK</li>
  <li>Well, well, I see the issue of these arms:</li>

  <li>You have misled a prince, a royal king,</li>
  <li>A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments,</li>
  <li class="number">By you unhappied and disfigured clean:</li>
  <li>You have in manner with your sinful hours</li>

  <li>From my own windows torn my household coat,</li>
  <li class="number">Razed out my imprese, leaving me no sign,</li>

  <li>Dear earth, I do salute thee with my hand,</li>
  <li>Though rebels wound thee with their horses' hoofs:</li>

  <li>Plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting,</li>
  <li class="number">So, weeping, smiling, greet I thee, my earth,</li>

  <li>And when they from thy bosom pluck a flower,</li>
  <li class="number">Guard it, I pray thee, with a lurking adder</li>

  <li class="number">The cloak of night being pluck'd from off their backs,</li>
  <li>Stand bare and naked, trembling at themselves?</li>
  <li>So when this thief, this traitor, Bolingbroke,</li>
  <li>Who all this while hath revell'd in the night</li>
  <li>Whilst we were wandering with the antipodes,</li>
  <li class="number">Shall see us rising in our throne, the east,</li>

  <li>Not all the water in the rough rude sea</li>

  <li>The breath of worldly men cannot depose</li>
  <li>The deputy elected by the Lord:</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HENRY PERCY</li>
  <li>Yes, my good lord,</li>
  <li>It doth contain a king; King Richard lies</li>
  <li>Within the limits of yon lime and stone:</li>
  <li>And with him are the Lord Aumerle, Lord Salisbury,</li>
  <li class="number">Sir Stephen Scroop, besides a clergyman</li>
  <li>Of holy reverence; who, I cannot learn.</li>

  <li class="speaker">HENRY BOLINGBROKE</li>
  <li>Noble lords,</li>
  <li>Go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle;</li>
  <li class="number">Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley</li>
  <li>Into his ruin'd ears, and thus deliver:</li>
  <li>Henry Bolingbroke</li>
  <li>On both his knees doth kiss King Richard's hand</li>
  <li>And sends allegiance and true faith of heart</li>
  <li class="number">To his most royal person, hither come</li>
  <li>Even at his feet to lay my arms and power,</li>
  <li>Provided that my banishment repeal'd</li>
  <li>And lands restored again be freely granted:</li>
  <li>If not, I'll use the advantage of my power</li>
  <li class="number">And lay the summer's dust with showers of blood</li>
  <li>Rain'd from the wounds of slaughter'd Englishmen:</li>
  <li>The which, how far off from the mind of Bolingbroke</li>
  <li>It is, such crimson tempest should bedrench</li>
  <li>The fresh green lap of fair King Richard's land,</li>
  <li class="number">My stooping duty tenderly shall show.</li>
  <li>Go, signify as much, while here we march</li>
  <li>Upon the grassy carpet of this plain.</li>
  <li>Let's march without the noise of threatening drum,</li>
  <li>That from this castle's tatter'd battlements</li>
  <li class="number">Our fair appointments may be well perused.</li>
  <li>Methinks King Richard and myself should meet</li>
  <li>With no less terror than the elements</li>
  <li>Of fire and water, when their thundering shock</li>
  <li>At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven.</li>
  <li class="number">Be he the fire, I'll be the yielding water:</li>
  <li>The rage be his, whilst on the earth I rain</li>
  <li>My waters; on the earth, and not on him.</li>
  <li>March on, and mark King Richard how he looks.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Parle without, and answer within. Then a flourish.
Enter on the walls, KING RICHARD II, the BISHOP OF
CARLISLE, DUKE OF AUMERLE, SIR STEPHEN SCROOP, and
EARL OF SALISBURY</li>
  <li>See, see, King Richard doth himself appear,</li>
  <li class="number">As doth the blushing discontented sun</li>
  <li>From out the fiery portal of the east,</li>
  <li>When he perceives the envious clouds are bent</li>
  <li>To dim his glory and to stain the track</li>
  <li>Of his bright passage to the occident.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DUKE OF YORK</li>
  <li class="number">Yet looks he like a king: behold, his eye,</li>
  <li>As bright as is the eagle's, lightens forth</li>

  <li>That any harm should stain so fair a show!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING RICHARD II</li>
  <li>We are amazed; and thus long have we stood</li>
  <li class="number">To watch the fearful bending of thy knee,</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">To NORTHUMBERLAND</li>
  <li>Because we thought ourself thy lawful king:</li>
  <li>And if we be, how dare thy joints forget</li>
  <li>To pay their awful duty to our presence?</li>
  <li>If we be not, show us the hand of God</li>
  <li class="number">That hath dismissed us from our stewardship;</li>
  <li>For well we know, no hand of blood and bone</li>
  <li>Can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre,</li>
  <li>Unless he do profane, steal, or usurp.</li>
  <li>And though you think that all, as you have done,</li>
  <li class="number">Have torn their souls by turning them from us,</li>

  <li>Yet know, my master, God omnipotent,</li>
  <li>Is mustering in his clouds on our behalf</li>
  <li>Armies of pestilence; and they shall strike</li>
  <li class="number">Your children yet unborn and unbegot,</li>
  <li>That lift your vassal hands against my head</li>

  <li>Tell Bolingbroke â€” for yond methinks he stands â€” </li>
  <li>That every stride he makes upon my land</li>
  <li class="number">Is dangerous treason: he is come to open</li>
  <li>The purple testament of bleeding war;</li>
  <li>But ere the crown he looks for live in peace,</li>
  <li>Ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers' sons</li>
  <li>Shall ill become the flower of England's face,</li>
  <li class="number">Change the complexion of her maid-pale peace</li>

  <li class="speaker">NORTHUMBERLAND</li>
  <li>The king of heaven forbid our lord the king</li>

  <li class="number">Be rush'd upon! Thy thrice noble cousin</li>
  <li>Harry Bolingbroke doth humbly kiss thy hand;</li>
  <li>And by the honourable tomb he swears,</li>
  <li>That stands upon your royal grandsire's bones,</li>
  <li>And by the royalties of both your bloods,</li>
  <li class="number">Currents that spring from one most gracious head,</li>
  <li>And by the buried hand of warlike Gaunt,</li>
  <li>And by the worth and honour of himself,</li>
  <li>Comprising all that may be sworn or said,</li>
  <li>His coming hither hath no further scope</li>
  <li class="number">Than for his lineal royalties and to beg</li>
  <li>Enfranchisement immediate on his knees:</li>
  <li>Which on thy royal party granted once,</li>
  <li>His glittering arms he will commend to rust,</li>
  <li>His barbed steeds to stables, and his heart</li>
  <li class="number">To faithful service of your majesty.</li>
  <li>This swears he, as he is a prince, is just;</li>
  <li>And, as I am a gentleman, I credit him.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING RICHARD II</li>

  <li>Shall be accomplish'd without contradiction:</li>
  <li>With all the gracious utterance thou hast</li>

  <li>We do debase ourselves, cousin, do we not,</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">To DUKE OF AUMERLE</li>
  <li class="number">To look so poorly and to speak so fair?</li>
  <li>Shall we call back Northumberland, and send</li>
  <li>Defiance to the traitor, and so die?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DUKE OF AUMERLE</li>
  <li>No, good my lord; let's fight with gentle words</li>
  <li>Till time lend friends and friends their helpful swords.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING RICHARD II</li>
  <li class="number">O God, O God! that e'er this tongue of mine,</li>
  <li>That laid the sentence of dread banishment</li>
  <li>On yon proud man, should take it off again</li>
  <li>With words of sooth! O that I were as great</li>
  <li>As is my grief, or lesser than my name!</li>
  <li class="number">Or that I could forget what I have been,</li>
  <li>Or not remember what I must be now!</li>

  <li>The name of king? o' God's name, let it go:</li>
  <li>I'll give my jewels for a set of beads,</li>
  <li class="number">My gorgeous palace for a hermitage,</li>
  <li>My gay apparel for an almsman's gown,</li>
  <li>My figured goblets for a dish of wood,</li>

  <li>My subjects for a pair of carved saints</li>
  <li class="number">And my large kingdom for a little grave,</li>
  <li>A little little grave, an obscure grave;</li>
  <li>Or I'll be buried in the king's highway,</li>
  <li>Some way of common trade, where subjects' feet</li>
  <li>May hourly trample on their sovereign's head;</li>
  <li class="number">For on my heart they tread now whilst I live;</li>
  <li>And buried once, why not upon my head?</li>
  <li>Aumerle, thou weep'st, my tender-hearted cousin!</li>
  <li>We'll make foul weather with despised tears;</li>
  <li>Our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn,</li>
  <li class="number">And make a dearth in this revolting land.</li>
  <li>Or shall we play the wantons with our woes,</li>
  <li>And make some pretty match with shedding tears?</li>
  <li>As thus, to drop them still upon one place,</li>
  <li>Till they have fretted us a pair of graves</li>
  <li class="number">Within the earth; and, therein laid â€”  there lies</li>
  <li>Two kinsmen digg'd their graves with weeping eyes.</li>
  <li>Would not this ill do well? Well, well, I see</li>
  <li>I talk but idly, and you laugh at me.</li>
  <li>Most mighty prince, my Lord Northumberland,</li>
  <li class="number">What says King Bolingbroke? will his majesty</li>
  <li>Give Richard leave to live till Richard die?</li>
  <li>You make a leg, and Bolingbroke says ay.</li>

  <li class="speaker">Lady</li>
  <li>Madam, we'll play at bowls.</li>

  <li>Madam, we'll dance.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">QUEEN</li>
  <li>My legs can keep no measure in delight,</li>

  <li>Of neither, girl:</li>
  <li>For of joy, being altogether wanting,</li>
  <li class="number">It doth remember me the more of sorrow;</li>
  <li>Or if of grief, being altogether had,</li>
  <li>It adds more sorrow to my want of joy:</li>

  <li>And what I want it boots not to complain.</li>

  <li>Go, bind thou up yon dangling apricocks,</li>

  <li>Stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight:</li>
  <li>Give some supportance to the bending twigs.</li>
  <li class="number">Go thou, and like an executioner,</li>
  <li>Cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays,</li>
  <li>That look too lofty in our commonwealth:</li>

  <li>You thus employ'd, I will go root away</li>

  <li>That seem'd in eating him to hold him up,</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Gardener</li>

  <li class="number">That he had not so trimm'd and dress'd his land</li>
  <li>As we this garden! We at time of year</li>
  <li>Do wound the bark, the skin of our fruit-trees,</li>

  <li>They might have lived to bear and he to taste</li>
  <li>Their fruits of duty: superfluous branches</li>
  <li>We lop away, that bearing boughs may live:</li>
  <li>Had he done so, himself had borne the crown,</li>
  <li class="number">Which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down.</li>

<ol class="speech">

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Gardener</li>
  <li>Depress'd he is already, and deposed</li>

  <li class="number">That tell black tidings.</li>

  <li>King Richard, he is in the mighty hold</li>

  <li>In your lord's scale is nothing but himself,</li>
  <li class="number">And some few vanities that make him light;</li>
  <li>But in the balance of great Bolingbroke,</li>
  <li>Besides himself, are all the English peers,</li>
  <li>And with that odds he weighs King Richard down.</li>
  <li>Post you to London, and you will find it so;</li>
  <li class="number">I speak no more than every one doth know.</li>

  <li>To serve me last, that I may longest keep</li>
  <li class="number">Thy sorrow in my breast. Come, ladies, go,</li>
  <li>To meet at London London's king in woe.</li>
  <li>What, was I born to this, that my sad look</li>

  <li>Nay, if I turn mine eyes upon myself,</li>

  <li class="speaker">DUCHESS OF YORK</li>
  <li>My lord, you told me you would tell the rest,</li>
  <li>When weeping made you break the story off,</li>
  <li>of our two cousins coming into London.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DUKE OF YORK</li>
  <li>Where did I leave?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DUCHESS OF YORK</li>
  <li class="number">At that sad stop, my lord,</li>
  <li>Where rude misgovern'd hands from windows' tops</li>
  <li>Threw dust and rubbish on King Richard's head.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DUKE OF YORK</li>
  <li>Then, as I said, the duke, great Bolingbroke,</li>
  <li>Mounted upon a hot and fiery steed</li>
  <li class="number">Which his aspiring rider seem'd to know,</li>
  <li>With slow but stately pace kept on his course,</li>
  <li>Whilst all tongues cried 'God save thee,</li>
  <li>Bolingbroke!'</li>
  <li>You would have thought the very windows spake,</li>
  <li class="number">So many greedy looks of young and old</li>
  <li>Through casements darted their desiring eyes</li>
  <li>Upon his visage, and that all the walls</li>
  <li>With painted imagery had said at once</li>
  <li>'Jesu preserve thee! welcome, Bolingbroke!'</li>
  <li class="number">Whilst he, from the one side to the other turning,</li>
  <li>Bareheaded, lower than his proud steed's neck,</li>
  <li>Bespake them thus: 'I thank you, countrymen:'</li>
  <li>And thus still doing, thus he pass'd along.</li>

  <li class="speaker">DUKE OF YORK</li>
  <li class="number">As in a theatre, the eyes of men,</li>

  <li>Thinking his prattle to be tedious;</li>
  <li>Even so, or with much more contempt, men's eyes</li>
  <li class="number">Did scowl on gentle Richard; no man cried 'God save him!'</li>
  <li>No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home:</li>
  <li>But dust was thrown upon his sacred head:</li>
  <li>Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off,</li>
  <li>His face still combating with tears and smiles,</li>
  <li class="number">The badges of his grief and patience,</li>
  <li>That had not God, for some strong purpose, steel'd</li>
  <li>The hearts of men, they must perforce have melted</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter KING RICHARD</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING RICHARD II</li>
  <li>I have been studying how I may compare</li>
  <li>This prison where I live unto the world:</li>
  <li>And for because the world is populous</li>
  <li>And here is not a creature but myself,</li>
  <li class="number">I cannot do it; yet I'll hammer it out.</li>
  <li>My brain I'll prove the female to my soul,</li>
  <li>My soul the father; and these two beget</li>
  <li>A generation of still-breeding thoughts,</li>
  <li>And these same thoughts people this little world,</li>
  <li class="number">In humours like the people of this world,</li>
  <li>For no thought is contented. The better sort,</li>
  <li>As thoughts of things divine, are intermix'd</li>
  <li>With scruples and do set the word itself</li>
  <li>Against the word:</li>
  <li class="number">As thus, 'Come, little ones,' and then again,</li>
  <li>'It is as hard to come as for a camel</li>
  <li>To thread the postern of a small needle's eye.'</li>
  <li>Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot</li>
  <li>Unlikely wonders; how these vain weak nails</li>
  <li class="number">May tear a passage through the flinty ribs</li>
  <li>Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls,</li>
  <li>And, for they cannot, die in their own pride.</li>
  <li>Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves</li>
  <li>That they are not the first of fortune's slaves,</li>
  <li class="number">Nor shall not be the last; like silly beggars</li>
  <li>Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame,</li>
  <li>That many have and others must sit there;</li>
  <li>And in this thought they find a kind of ease,</li>
  <li>Bearing their own misfortunes on the back</li>
  <li class="number">Of such as have before endured the like.</li>
  <li>Thus play I in one person many people,</li>
  <li>And none contented: sometimes am I king;</li>
  <li>Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar,</li>
  <li>And so I am: then crushing penury</li>
  <li class="number">Persuades me I was better when a king;</li>
  <li>Then am I king'd again: and by and by</li>
  <li>Think that I am unking'd by Bolingbroke,</li>
  <li>And straight am nothing: but whate'er I be,</li>
  <li>Nor I nor any man that but man is</li>
  <li class="number">With nothing shall be pleased, till he be eased</li>
  <li>With being nothing. Music do I hear?</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Music</li>
  <li>Ha, ha! keep time: how sour sweet music is,</li>
  <li>When time is broke and no proportion kept!</li>
  <li>So is it in the music of men's lives.</li>
  <li class="number">And here have I the daintiness of ear</li>
  <li>To cheque time broke in a disorder'd string;</li>
  <li>But for the concord of my state and time</li>
  <li>Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.</li>
  <li>I wasted time, and now doth time waste me;</li>
  <li class="number">For now hath time made me his numbering clock:</li>
  <li>My thoughts are minutes; and with sighs they jar</li>
  <li>Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,</li>
  <li>Whereto my finger, like a dial's point,</li>
  <li>Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.</li>
  <li class="number">Now sir, the sound that tells what hour it is</li>
  <li>Are clamorous groans, which strike upon my heart,</li>
  <li>Which is the bell: so sighs and tears and groans</li>
  <li>Show minutes, times, and hours: but my time</li>
  <li>Runs posting on in Bolingbroke's proud joy,</li>
  <li class="number">While I stand fooling here, his Jack o' the clock.</li>
  <li>This music mads me; let it sound no more;</li>
  <li>For though it have holp madmen to their wits,</li>
  <li>In me it seems it will make wise men mad.</li>
  <li>Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me!</li>

  <li>Is a strange brooch in this all-hating world.</li>

  <li>Would he not stumble? would he not fall down,</li>
  <li>Since pride must have a fall, and break the neck</li>
  <li class="number">Of that proud man that did usurp his back?</li>
  <li>Forgiveness, horse! why do I rail on thee,</li>
