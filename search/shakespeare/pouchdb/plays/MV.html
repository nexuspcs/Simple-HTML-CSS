<h3>SCENE I.  Venice. A street.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter ANTONIO, SALARINO, and SALANIO</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ANTONIO</li>
  <li>In sooth, I know not why I am so sad:</li>
  <li>It wearies me; you say it wearies you;</li>
  <li>But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,</li>
  <li>What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born,</li>
  <li class="number">I am to learn;</li>
  <li>And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,</li>
  <li>That I have much ado to know myself.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SALARINO</li>
  <li>Your mind is tossing on the ocean;</li>
  <li>There, where your argosies with portly sail,</li>
  <li class="number">Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,</li>
  <li>Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea,</li>
  <li>Do overpeer the petty traffickers,</li>
  <li>That curtsy to them, do them reverence,</li>
  <li>As they fly by them with their woven wings.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SALANIO</li>
  <li class="number">Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,</li>
  <li>The better part of my affections would</li>
  <li>Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still</li>
  <li>Plucking the grass, to know where sits the wind,</li>
  <li>Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads;</li>
  <li class="number">And every object that might make me fear</li>
  <li>Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt</li>
  <li>Would make me sad.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SALARINO</li>
  <li>My wind cooling my broth</li>
  <li>Would blow me to an ague, when I thought</li>
  <li class="number">What harm a wind too great at sea might do.</li>
  <li>I should not see the sandy hour-glass run,</li>
  <li>But I should think of shallows and of flats,</li>
  <li>And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand,</li>
  <li>Vailing her high-top lower than her ribs</li>
  <li class="number">To kiss her burial. Should I go to church</li>
  <li>And see the holy edifice of stone,</li>
  <li>And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,</li>
  <li>Which touching but my gentle vessel's side,</li>
  <li>Would scatter all her spices on the stream,</li>
  <li class="number">Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,</li>
  <li>And, in a word, but even now worth this,</li>
  <li>And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought</li>
  <li>To think on this, and shall I lack the thought</li>
  <li>That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?</li>
  <li class="number">But tell not me; I know, Antonio</li>
  <li>Is sad to think upon his merchandise.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ANTONIO</li>
  <li>Believe me, no: I thank my fortune for it,</li>
  <li>My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,</li>
  <li>Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate</li>
  <li class="number">Upon the fortune of this present year:</li>
  <li>Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SALARINO</li>
  <li>Why, then you are in love.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ANTONIO</li>
  <li>Fie, fie!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SALARINO</li>
  <li>Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad,</li>
  <li class="number">Because you are not merry: and 'twere as easy</li>
  <li>For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry,</li>
  <li>Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus,</li>
  <li>Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time:</li>
  <li>Some that will evermore peep through their eyes</li>
  <li class="number">And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper,</li>
  <li>And other of such vinegar aspect</li>
  <li>That they'll not show their teeth in way of smile,</li>
  <li>Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter BASSANIO, LORENZO, and GRATIANO</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SALANIO</li>
  <li>Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,</li>
  <li class="number">Gratiano and Lorenzo. Fare ye well:</li>
  <li>We leave you now with better company.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SALARINO</li>
  <li>I would have stay'd till I had made you merry,</li>
  <li>If worthier friends had not prevented me.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ANTONIO</li>
  <li>Your worth is very dear in my regard.</li>
  <li class="number">I take it, your own business calls on you</li>
  <li>And you embrace the occasion to depart.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SALARINO</li>
  <li>Good morrow, my good lords.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BASSANIO</li>
  <li>Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? say, when?</li>
  <li>You grow exceeding strange: must it be so?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SALARINO</li>
  <li class="number">We'll make our leisures to attend on yours.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt Salarino and Salanio</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LORENZO</li>
  <li>My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,</li>
  <li>We two will leave you: but at dinner-time,</li>
  <li>I pray you, have in mind where we must meet.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BASSANIO</li>
  <li>I will not fail you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GRATIANO</li>
  <li class="number">You look not well, Signior Antonio;</li>
  <li>You have too much respect upon the world:</li>
  <li>They lose it that do buy it with much care:</li>
  <li>Believe me, you are marvellously changed.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ANTONIO</li>
  <li>I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano;</li>
  <li class="number">A stage where every man must play a part,</li>
  <li>And mine a sad one.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GRATIANO</li>
  <li>Let me play the fool:</li>
  <li>With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,</li>
  <li>And let my liver rather heat with wine</li>
  <li class="number">Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.</li>
  <li>Why should a man, whose blood is warm within,</li>
  <li>Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?</li>
  <li>Sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice</li>
  <li>By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio — </li>
  <li class="number">I love thee, and it is my love that speaks — </li>
  <li>There are a sort of men whose visages</li>
  <li>Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,</li>
  <li>And do a wilful stillness entertain,</li>
  <li>With purpose to be dress'd in an opinion</li>
  <li class="number">Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,</li>
  <li>As who should say 'I am Sir Oracle,</li>
  <li>And when I ope my lips let no dog bark!'</li>
  <li>O my Antonio, I do know of these</li>
  <li>That therefore only are reputed wise</li>
  <li class="number">For saying nothing; when, I am very sure,</li>
  <li>If they should speak, would almost damn those ears,</li>
  <li>Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.</li>
  <li>I'll tell thee more of this another time:</li>
  <li>But fish not, with this melancholy bait,</li>
  <li class="number">For this fool gudgeon, this opinion.</li>
  <li>Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well awhile:</li>
  <li>I'll end my exhortation after dinner.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LORENZO</li>
  <li>Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time:</li>
  <li>I must be one of these same dumb wise men,</li>
  <li class="number">For Gratiano never lets me speak.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GRATIANO</li>
  <li>Well, keep me company but two years moe,</li>
  <li>Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ANTONIO</li>
  <li>Farewell: I'll grow a talker for this gear.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GRATIANO</li>
  <li>Thanks, i' faith, for silence is only commendable</li>
  <li class="number">In a neat's tongue dried and a maid not vendible.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt GRATIANO and LORENZO</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ANTONIO</li>
  <li>Is that any thing now?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BASSANIO</li>
  <li>Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more</li>
  <li>than any man in all Venice. His reasons are as two</li>
  <li>grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: you</li>
  <li class="number">shall seek all day ere you find them, and when you</li>
  <li>have them, they are not worth the search.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ANTONIO</li>
  <li>Well, tell me now what lady is the same</li>
  <li>To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,</li>
  <li>That you to-day promised to tell me of?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BASSANIO</li>
  <li class="number">'Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,</li>
  <li>How much I have disabled mine estate,</li>
  <li>By something showing a more swelling port</li>
  <li>Than my faint means would grant continuance:</li>
  <li>Nor do I now make moan to be abridged</li>
  <li class="number">From such a noble rate; but my chief care</li>
  <li>Is to come fairly off from the great debts</li>
  <li>Wherein my time something too prodigal</li>
  <li>Hath left me gaged. To you, Antonio,</li>
  <li>I owe the most, in money and in love,</li>
  <li class="number">And from your love I have a warranty</li>
  <li>To unburden all my plots and purposes</li>
  <li>How to get clear of all the debts I owe.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ANTONIO</li>
  <li>I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;</li>
  <li>And if it stand, as you yourself still do,</li>
  <li class="number">Within the eye of honour, be assured,</li>
  <li>My purse, my person, my extremest means,</li>
  <li>Lie all unlock'd to your occasions.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BASSANIO</li>
  <li>In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,</li>
  <li>I shot his fellow of the self-same flight</li>
  <li class="number">The self-same way with more advised watch,</li>
  <li>To find the other forth, and by adventuring both</li>
  <li>I oft found both: I urge this childhood proof,</li>
  <li>Because what follows is pure innocence.</li>
  <li>I owe you much, and, like a wilful youth,</li>
  <li class="number">That which I owe is lost; but if you please</li>
  <li>To shoot another arrow that self way</li>
  <li>Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,</li>
  <li>As I will watch the aim, or to find both</li>
  <li>Or bring your latter hazard back again</li>
  <li class="number">And thankfully rest debtor for the first.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ANTONIO</li>
  <li>You know me well, and herein spend but time</li>
  <li>To wind about my love with circumstance;</li>
  <li>And out of doubt you do me now more wrong</li>
  <li>In making question of my uttermost</li>
  <li class="number">Than if you had made waste of all I have:</li>
  <li>Then do but say to me what I should do</li>
  <li>That in your knowledge may by me be done,</li>
  <li>And I am prest unto it: therefore, speak.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BASSANIO</li>
  <li>In Belmont is a lady richly left;</li>
  <li class="number">And she is fair, and, fairer than that word,</li>
  <li>Of wondrous virtues: sometimes from her eyes</li>
  <li>I did receive fair speechless messages:</li>
  <li>Her name is Portia, nothing undervalued</li>
  <li>To Cato's daughter, Brutus' Portia:</li>
  <li class="number">Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,</li>
  <li>For the four winds blow in from every coast</li>
  <li>Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks</li>
  <li>Hang on her temples like a golden fleece;</li>
  <li>Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos' strand,</li>
  <li class="number">And many Jasons come in quest of her.</li>
  <li>O my Antonio, had I but the means</li>
  <li>To hold a rival place with one of them,</li>
  <li>I have a mind presages me such thrift,</li>
  <li>That I should questionless be fortunate!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ANTONIO</li>
  <li class="number">Thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea;</li>
  <li>Neither have I money nor commodity</li>
  <li>To raise a present sum: therefore go forth;</li>
  <li>Try what my credit can in Venice do:</li>
  <li>That shall be rack'd, even to the uttermost,</li>
  <li class="number">To furnish thee to Belmont, to fair Portia.</li>
  <li>Go, presently inquire, and so will I,</li>
  <li>Where money is, and I no question make</li>
  <li>To have it of my trust or for my sake.</li>
</ol>

<h3>SCENE II: Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter PORTIA and NERISSA</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li>By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of</li>
  <li>this great world.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NERISSA</li>
  <li>You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in</li>
  <li>the same abundance as your good fortunes are: and</li>
  <li class="number">yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit</li>
  <li>with too much as they that starve with nothing. It</li>
  <li>is no mean happiness therefore, to be seated in the</li>
  <li>mean: superfluity comes sooner by white hairs, but</li>
  <li>competency lives longer.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li class="number">Good sentences and well pronounced.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NERISSA</li>
  <li>They would be better, if well followed.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li>If to do were as easy as to know what were good to</li>
  <li>do, chapels had been churches and poor men's</li>
  <li>cottages princes' palaces. It is a good divine that</li>
  <li class="number">follows his own instructions: I can easier teach</li>
  <li>twenty what were good to be done, than be one of the</li>
  <li>twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may</li>
  <li>devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps</li>
  <li>o'er a cold decree: such a hare is madness the</li>
  <li class="number">youth, to skip o'er the meshes of good counsel the</li>
  <li>cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to</li>
  <li>choose me a husband. O me, the word 'choose!' I may</li>
  <li>neither choose whom I would nor refuse whom I</li>
  <li>dislike; so is the will of a living daughter curbed</li>
  <li class="number">by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard,</li>
  <li>Nerissa, that I cannot choose one nor refuse none?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NERISSA</li>
  <li>Your father was ever virtuous; and holy men at their</li>
  <li>death have good inspirations: therefore the lottery,</li>
  <li>that he hath devised in these three chests of gold,</li>
  <li class="number">silver and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning</li>
  <li>chooses you, will, no doubt, never be chosen by any</li>
  <li>rightly but one who shall rightly love. But what</li>
  <li>warmth is there in your affection towards any of</li>
  <li>these princely suitors that are already come?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li class="number">I pray thee, over-name them; and as thou namest</li>
  <li>them, I will describe them; and, according to my</li>
  <li>description, level at my affection.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NERISSA</li>
  <li>First, there is the Neapolitan prince.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li>Ay, that's a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but</li>
  <li class="number">talk of his horse; and he makes it a great</li>
  <li>appropriation to his own good parts, that he can</li>
  <li>shoe him himself. I am much afeard my lady his</li>
  <li>mother played false with a smith.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NERISSA</li>
  <li>Then there is the County Palatine.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li class="number">He doth nothing but frown, as who should say 'If you</li>
  <li>will not have me, choose:' he hears merry tales and</li>
  <li>smiles not: I fear he will prove the weeping</li>
  <li>philosopher when he grows old, being so full of</li>
  <li>unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather be</li>
  <li class="number">married to a death's-head with a bone in his mouth</li>
  <li>than to either of these. God defend me from these</li>
  <li>two!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NERISSA</li>
  <li>How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li>God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man.</li>
  <li class="number">In truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker: but,</li>
  <li>he! why, he hath a horse better than the</li>
  <li>Neapolitan's, a better bad habit of frowning than</li>
  <li>the Count Palatine; he is every man in no man; if a</li>
  <li>throstle sing, he falls straight a capering: he will</li>
  <li class="number">fence with his own shadow: if I should marry him, I</li>
  <li>should marry twenty husbands. If he would despise me</li>
  <li>I would forgive him, for if he love me to madness, I</li>
  <li>shall never requite him.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NERISSA</li>
  <li>What say you, then, to Falconbridge, the young baron</li>
  <li class="number">of England?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li>You know I say nothing to him, for he understands</li>
  <li>not me, nor I him: he hath neither Latin, French,</li>
  <li>nor Italian, and you will come into the court and</li>
  <li>swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English.</li>
  <li class="number">He is a proper man's picture, but, alas, who can</li>
  <li>converse with a dumb-show? How oddly he is suited!</li>
  <li>I think he bought his doublet in Italy, his round</li>
  <li>hose in France, his bonnet in Germany and his</li>
  <li>behavior every where.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NERISSA</li>
  <li class="number">What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li>That he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he</li>
  <li>borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman and</li>
  <li>swore he would pay him again when he was able: I</li>
  <li>think the Frenchman became his surety and sealed</li>
  <li class="number">under for another.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NERISSA</li>
  <li>How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony's nephew?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li>Very vilely in the morning, when he is sober, and</li>
  <li>most vilely in the afternoon, when he is drunk: when</li>
  <li>he is best, he is a little worse than a man, and</li>
  <li class="number">when he is worst, he is little better than a beast:</li>
  <li>and the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall</li>
  <li>make shift to go without him.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NERISSA</li>
  <li>If he should offer to choose, and choose the right</li>
  <li>casket, you should refuse to perform your father's</li>
  <li class="number">will, if you should refuse to accept him.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li>Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee, set a</li>
  <li>deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket,</li>
  <li>for if the devil be within and that temptation</li>
  <li>without, I know he will choose it. I will do any</li>
  <li class="number">thing, Nerissa, ere I'll be married to a sponge.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NERISSA</li>
  <li>You need not fear, lady, the having any of these</li>
  <li>lords: they have acquainted me with their</li>
  <li>determinations; which is, indeed, to return to their</li>
  <li>home and to trouble you with no more suit, unless</li>
  <li class="number">you may be won by some other sort than your father's</li>
  <li>imposition depending on the caskets.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li>If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as</li>
  <li>chaste as Diana, unless I be obtained by the manner</li>
  <li>of my father's will. I am glad this parcel of wooers</li>
  <li class="number">are so reasonable, for there is not one among them</li>
  <li>but I dote on his very absence, and I pray God grant</li>
  <li>them a fair departure.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NERISSA</li>
  <li>Do you not remember, lady, in your father's time, a</li>
  <li>Venetian, a scholar and a soldier, that came hither</li>
  <li class="number">in company of the Marquis of Montferrat?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li>Yes, yes, it was Bassanio; as I think, he was so called.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NERISSA</li>
  <li>True, madam: he, of all the men that ever my foolish</li>
  <li>eyes looked upon, was the best deserving a fair lady.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li>I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of</li>
  <li class="number">thy praise.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Enter a Serving-man</li>
  <li>How now! what news?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Servant</li>
  <li>The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take</li>
  <li>their leave: and there is a forerunner come from a</li>
  <li>fifth, the Prince of Morocco, who brings word the</li>
  <li class="number">prince his master will be here to-night.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li>If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good a</li>
  <li>heart as I can bid the other four farewell, I should</li>
  <li>be glad of his approach: if he have the condition</li>
  <li>of a saint and the complexion of a devil, I had</li>
  <li class="number">rather he should shrive me than wive me. Come,</li>
  <li>Nerissa. Sirrah, go before.</li>

  <li>upon one wooer, another knocks at the door.</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter BASSANIO and SHYLOCK</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SHYLOCK</li>
  <li>Three thousand ducats; well.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BASSANIO</li>
  <li>Ay, sir, for three months.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SHYLOCK</li>
  <li>For three months; well.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BASSANIO</li>
  <li>For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SHYLOCK</li>
  <li class="number">Antonio shall become bound; well.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BASSANIO</li>
  <li>May you stead me? will you pleasure me? shall I</li>
  <li>know your answer?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SHYLOCK</li>
  <li>Three thousand ducats for three months and Antonio bound.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BASSANIO</li>
  <li>Your answer to that.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SHYLOCK</li>
  <li class="number">Antonio is a good man.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BASSANIO</li>
  <li>Have you heard any imputation to the contrary?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SHYLOCK</li>
  <li>Oh, no, no, no, no: my meaning in saying he is a</li>
  <li>good man is to have you understand me that he is</li>
  <li>sufficient. Yet his means are in supposition: he</li>
  <li class="number">hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the</li>
  <li>Indies; I understand moreover, upon the Rialto, he</li>
  <li>hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and</li>
  <li>other ventures he hath, squandered abroad. But ships</li>
  <li>are but boards, sailors but men: there be land-rats</li>
  <li class="number">and water-rats, water-thieves and land-thieves, I</li>
  <li>mean pirates, and then there is the peril of waters,</li>
  <li>winds and rocks. The man is, notwithstanding,</li>
  <li>sufficient. Three thousand ducats; I think I may</li>
  <li>take his bond.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BASSANIO</li>
  <li class="number">Be assured you may.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SHYLOCK</li>
  <li>I will be assured I may; and, that I may be assured,</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BASSANIO</li>
  <li>If it please you to dine with us.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SHYLOCK</li>
  <li>Yes, to smell pork; to eat of the habitation which</li>
  <li class="number">your prophet the Nazarite conjured the devil into. I</li>
  <li>will buy with you, sell with you, talk with you,</li>
  <li>walk with you, and so following, but I will not eat</li>
  <li>with you, drink with you, nor pray with you. What</li>
  <li>news on the Rialto? Who is he comes here?</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter ANTONIO</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BASSANIO</li>
  <li class="number">This is Signior Antonio.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SHYLOCK</li>
  <li>Aside  How like a fawning publican he looks!</li>
  <li>I hate him for he is a Christian,</li>
  <li>But more for that in low simplicity</li>
  <li>He lends out money gratis and brings down</li>
  <li class="number">The rate of usance here with us in Venice.</li>
  <li>If I can catch him once upon the hip,</li>
  <li>I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.</li>
  <li>He hates our sacred nation, and he rails,</li>
  <li>Even there where merchants most do congregate,</li>
  <li class="number">On me, my bargains and my well-won thrift,</li>
  <li>Which he calls interest. Cursed be my tribe,</li>
  <li>If I forgive him!</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BASSANIO</li>
  <li>Shylock, do you hear?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SHYLOCK</li>
  <li>I am debating of my present store,</li>
  <li class="number">And, by the near guess of my memory,</li>
  <li>I cannot instantly raise up the gross</li>
  <li>Of full three thousand ducats. What of that?</li>
  <li>Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,</li>
  <li>Will furnish me. But soft! how many months</li>
  <li class="number">Do you desire?</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">To ANTONIO</li>
  <li>Rest you fair, good signior;</li>
  <li>Your worship was the last man in our mouths.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ANTONIO</li>
  <li>Shylock, although I neither lend nor borrow</li>
  <li>By taking nor by giving of excess,</li>
  <li class="number">Yet, to supply the ripe wants of my friend,</li>
  <li>I'll break a custom. Is he yet possess'd</li>
  <li>How much ye would?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SHYLOCK</li>
  <li>Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ANTONIO</li>
  <li>And for three months.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SHYLOCK</li>
  <li class="number">I had forgot; three months; you told me so.</li>
  <li>Well then, your bond; and let me see; but hear you;</li>
  <li>Methought you said you neither lend nor borrow</li>
  <li>Upon advantage.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ANTONIO</li>
  <li>I do never use it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SHYLOCK</li>
  <li class="number">When Jacob grazed his uncle Laban's sheep — </li>
  <li>This Jacob from our holy Abram was,</li>
  <li>As his wise mother wrought in his behalf,</li>
  <li>The third possessor; ay, he was the third — </li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ANTONIO</li>
  <li>And what of him? did he take interest?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SHYLOCK</li>
  <li class="number">No, not take interest, not, as you would say,</li>
  <li>Directly interest: mark what Jacob did.</li>
  <li>When Laban and himself were compromised</li>
  <li>That all the eanlings which were streak'd and pied</li>
  <li>Should fall as Jacob's hire, the ewes, being rank,</li>
  <li class="number">In the end of autumn turned to the rams,</li>
  <li>And, when the work of generation was</li>
  <li>Between these woolly breeders in the act,</li>
  <li>The skilful shepherd peel'd me certain wands,</li>
  <li>And, in the doing of the deed of kind,</li>
  <li class="number">He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,</li>
  <li>Who then conceiving did in eaning time</li>
  <li>Fall parti-colour'd lambs, and those were Jacob's.</li>
  <li>This was a way to thrive, and he was blest:</li>
  <li>And thrift is blessing, if men steal it not.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ANTONIO</li>
  <li class="number">This was a venture, sir, that Jacob served for;</li>
  <li>A thing not in his power to bring to pass,</li>
  <li>But sway'd and fashion'd by the hand of heaven.</li>
  <li>Was this inserted to make interest good?</li>
  <li>Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SHYLOCK</li>
  <li class="number">I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast:</li>
  <li>But note me, signior.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ANTONIO</li>
  <li>Mark you this, Bassanio,</li>
  <li>The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.</li>
  <li>An evil soul producing holy witness</li>
  <li class="number">Is like a villain with a smiling cheek,</li>
  <li>A goodly apple rotten at the heart:</li>
  <li>O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SHYLOCK</li>
  <li>Three thousand ducats; 'tis a good round sum.</li>
  <li>Three months from twelve; then, let me see; the rate — </li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ANTONIO</li>
  <li class="number">Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SHYLOCK</li>
  <li>Signior Antonio, many a time and oft</li>
  <li>In the Rialto you have rated me</li>
  <li>About my moneys and my usances:</li>
  <li>Still have I borne it with a patient shrug,</li>
  <li class="number">For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe.</li>
  <li>You call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog,</li>
  <li>And spit upon my Jewish gaberdine,</li>
  <li>And all for use of that which is mine own.</li>
  <li>Well then, it now appears you need my help:</li>
  <li class="number">Go to, then; you come to me, and you say</li>
  <li>'Shylock, we would have moneys:' you say so;</li>
  <li>You, that did void your rheum upon my beard</li>
  <li>And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur</li>
  <li>Over your threshold: moneys is your suit</li>
  <li class="number">What should I say to you? Should I not say</li>
  <li>'Hath a dog money? is it possible</li>
  <li>A cur can lend three thousand ducats?' Or</li>
  <li>Shall I bend low and in a bondman's key,</li>
  <li>With bated breath and whispering humbleness, Say this;</li>
  <li class="number">'Fair sir, you spit on me on Wednesday last;</li>
  <li>You spurn'd me such a day; another time</li>
  <li>You call'd me dog; and for these courtesies</li>
  <li>I'll lend you thus much moneys'?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ANTONIO</li>
  <li>I am as like to call thee so again,</li>
  <li class="number">To spit on thee again, to spurn thee too.</li>
  <li>If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not</li>
  <li>As to thy friends; for when did friendship take</li>
  <li>A breed for barren metal of his friend?</li>
  <li>But lend it rather to thine enemy,</li>
  <li class="number">Who, if he break, thou mayst with better face</li>
  <li>Exact the penalty.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SHYLOCK</li>
  <li>Why, look you, how you storm!</li>
  <li>I would be friends with you and have your love,</li>
  <li>Forget the shames that you have stain'd me with,</li>
  <li class="number">Supply your present wants and take no doit</li>
  <li>Of usance for my moneys, and you'll not hear me:</li>
  <li>This is kind I offer.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BASSANIO</li>
  <li>This were kindness.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SHYLOCK</li>
  <li>This kindness will I show.</li>
  <li class="number">Go with me to a notary, seal me there</li>
  <li>Your single bond; and, in a merry sport,</li>
  <li>If you repay me not on such a day,</li>
  <li>In such a place, such sum or sums as are</li>
  <li>Express'd in the condition, let the forfeit</li>
  <li class="number">Be nominated for an equal pound</li>
  <li>Of your fair flesh, to be cut off and taken</li>
  <li>In what part of your body pleaseth me.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ANTONIO</li>
  <li>Content, i' faith: I'll seal to such a bond</li>
  <li>And say there is much kindness in the Jew.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BASSANIO</li>
  <li class="number">You shall not seal to such a bond for me:</li>
  <li>I'll rather dwell in my necessity.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ANTONIO</li>
  <li>Why, fear not, man; I will not forfeit it:</li>
  <li>Within these two months, that's a month before</li>
  <li>This bond expires, I do expect return</li>
  <li class="number">Of thrice three times the value of this bond.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SHYLOCK</li>
  <li>O father Abram, what these Christians are,</li>
  <li>Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect</li>
  <li>The thoughts of others! Pray you, tell me this;</li>
  <li>If he should break his day, what should I gain</li>
  <li class="number">By the exaction of the forfeiture?</li>
  <li>A pound of man's flesh taken from a man</li>
  <li>Is not so estimable, profitable neither,</li>
  <li>As flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats. I say,</li>
  <li>To buy his favour, I extend this friendship:</li>
  <li class="number">If he will take it, so; if not, adieu;</li>
  <li>And, for my love, I pray you wrong me not.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ANTONIO</li>
  <li>Yes Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SHYLOCK</li>
  <li>Then meet me forthwith at the notary's;</li>
  <li>Give him direction for this merry bond,</li>
  <li class="number">And I will go and purse the ducats straight,</li>
  <li>See to my house, left in the fearful guard</li>
  <li>Of an unthrifty knave, and presently</li>
  <li>I will be with you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ANTONIO</li>
  <li>Hie thee, gentle Jew.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Exit Shylock</li>
  <li class="number">The Hebrew will turn Christian: he grows kind.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BASSANIO</li>
  <li>I like not fair terms and a villain's mind.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ANTONIO</li>
  <li>Come on: in this there can be no dismay;</li>
  <li>My ships come home a month before the day.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LAUNCELOT</li>
  <li>Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from</li>
  <li>this Jew my master. The fiend is at mine elbow and</li>

  <li>Launcelot,' or 'good Gobbo,' or good Launcelot</li>
  <li class="number">Gobbo, use your legs, take the start, run away. My</li>
  <li>conscience says 'No; take heed,' honest Launcelot;</li>
  <li>take heed, honest Gobbo, or, as aforesaid, 'honest</li>
  <li>Launcelot Gobbo; do not run; scorn running with thy</li>
  <li>heels.' Well, the most courageous fiend bids me</li>
  <li class="number">pack: 'Via!' says the fiend; 'away!' says the</li>
  <li>fiend; 'for the heavens, rouse up a brave mind,'</li>
  <li>says the fiend, 'and run.' Well, my conscience,</li>
  <li>hanging about the neck of my heart, says very wisely</li>
  <li>to me 'My honest friend Launcelot, being an honest</li>
  <li class="number">man's son,' or rather an honest woman's son; for,</li>
  <li>indeed, my father did something smack, something</li>
  <li>grow to, he had a kind of taste; well, my conscience</li>
  <li>says 'Launcelot, budge not.' 'Budge,' says the</li>
  <li>fiend. 'Budge not,' says my conscience.</li>
  <li class="number">'Conscience,' say I, 'you counsel well;' ' Fiend,'</li>
  <li>say I, 'you counsel well:' to be ruled by my</li>

  <li>run away from the Jew, I should be ruled by the</li>
  <li class="number">fiend, who, saving your reverence, is the devil</li>
  <li>himself. Certainly the Jew is the very devil</li>
  <li>incarnal; and, in my conscience, my conscience is</li>
  <li>but a kind of hard conscience, to offer to counsel</li>
  <li>me to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the more</li>

  <li>Nay, indeed, if you had your eyes, you might fail of</li>

  <li>The second, silver, which this promise carries,</li>
  <li>'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves;'</li>

  <li>'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'</li>
  <li>Must give: for what? for lead? hazard for lead?</li>
  <li>This casket threatens. Men that hazard all</li>
  <li>Do it in hope of fair advantages:</li>
  <li class="number">A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross;</li>
  <li>I'll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead.</li>
  <li>What says the silver with her virgin hue?</li>
  <li>'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.'</li>
  <li>As much as he deserves! Pause there, Morocco,</li>
  <li class="number">And weigh thy value with an even hand:</li>
  <li>If thou be'st rated by thy estimation,</li>
  <li>Thou dost deserve enough; and yet enough</li>
  <li>May not extend so far as to the lady:</li>
  <li>And yet to be afeard of my deserving</li>
  <li class="number">Were but a weak disabling of myself.</li>
  <li>As much as I deserve! Why, that's the lady:</li>
  <li>I do in birth deserve her, and in fortunes,</li>
  <li>In graces and in qualities of breeding;</li>
  <li>But more than these, in love I do deserve.</li>
  <li class="number">What if I stray'd no further, but chose here?</li>
  <li>Let's see once more this saying graved in gold</li>
  <li>'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.'</li>
  <li>Why, that's the lady; all the world desires her;</li>
  <li>From the four corners of the earth they come,</li>
  <li class="number">To kiss this shrine, this mortal-breathing saint:</li>
  <li>The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds</li>

  <li>The watery kingdom, whose ambitious head</li>
  <li class="number">Spits in the face of heaven, is no bar</li>
  <li>To stop the foreign spirits, but they come,</li>
  <li>As o'er a brook, to see fair Portia.</li>
  <li>One of these three contains her heavenly picture.</li>
  <li>Is't like that lead contains her? 'Twere damnation</li>
  <li class="number">To think so base a thought: it were too gross</li>
  <li>To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave.</li>
  <li>Or shall I think in silver she's immured,</li>
  <li>Being ten times undervalued to tried gold?</li>
  <li>O sinful thought! Never so rich a gem</li>
  <li class="number">Was set in worse than gold. They have in England</li>
  <li>A coin that bears the figure of an angel</li>

  <li>They were not with Bassanio in his ship.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SALANIO</li>
  <li>You were best to tell Antonio what you hear;</li>

  <li>A kinder gentleman treads not the earth.</li>

  <li class="number">Slubber not business for my sake, Bassanio</li>

  <li>And for the Jew's bond which he hath of me,</li>

  <li>Be merry, and employ your chiefest thoughts</li>
  <li class="number">To courtship and such fair ostents of love</li>
  <li>As shall conveniently become you there:'</li>
  <li>And even there, his eye being big with tears,</li>

  <li>How now, Shylock! what news among the merchants?</li>

<ol class="speech">

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SHYLOCK</li>
  <li>There I have another bad match: a bankrupt, a</li>

  <li class="speaker">SHYLOCK</li>
  <li>To bait fish withal: if it will feed nothing else,</li>
  <li>it will feed my revenge. He hath disgraced me, and</li>
  <li class="number">hindered me half a million; laughed at my losses,</li>
  <li>mocked at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my</li>
  <li>bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine</li>
  <li>enemies; and what's his reason? I am a Jew. Hath</li>
  <li>not a Jew eyes? hath not a Jew hands, organs,</li>
  <li class="number">dimensions, senses, affections, passions? fed with</li>
  <li>the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject</li>
  <li>to the same diseases, healed by the same means,</li>
  <li>warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer, as</li>
  <li>a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed?</li>
  <li class="number">if you tickle us, do we not laugh? if you poison</li>
  <li>us, do we not die? and if you wrong us, shall we not</li>
  <li>revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will</li>
  <li>resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian,</li>
  <li>what is his humility? Revenge. If a Christian</li>
  <li class="number">wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by</li>
  <li>Christian example? Why, revenge. The villany you</li>

Attendants</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li>I pray you, tarry: pause a day or two</li>
  <li>Before you hazard; for, in choosing wrong,</li>
  <li>I lose your company: therefore forbear awhile.</li>
  <li>There's something tells me, but it is not love,</li>
  <li class="number">I would not lose you; and you know yourself,</li>
  <li>Hate counsels not in such a quality.</li>
  <li>But lest you should not understand me well —  </li>
  <li>And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought —  </li>
  <li>I would detain you here some month or two</li>
  <li class="number">Before you venture for me. I could teach you</li>
  <li>How to choose right, but I am then forsworn;</li>
  <li>So will I never be: so may you miss me;</li>
  <li>But if you do, you'll make me wish a sin,</li>
  <li>That I had been forsworn. Beshrew your eyes,</li>
  <li class="number">They have o'erlook'd me and divided me;</li>
  <li>One half of me is yours, the other half yours,</li>
  <li>Mine own, I would say; but if mine, then yours,</li>
  <li>And so all yours. O, these naughty times</li>
  <li>Put bars between the owners and their rights!</li>
  <li class="number">And so, though yours, not yours. Prove it so,</li>
  <li>Let fortune go to hell for it, not I.</li>
  <li>I speak too long; but 'tis to peize the time,</li>
  <li>To eke it and to draw it out in length,</li>
  <li>To stay you from election.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BASSANIO</li>
  <li class="number">Let me choose</li>
  <li>For as I am, I live upon the rack.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li>Upon the rack, Bassanio! then confess</li>
  <li>What treason there is mingled with your love.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BASSANIO</li>
  <li>None but that ugly treason of mistrust,</li>
  <li class="number">Which makes me fear the enjoying of my love:</li>
  <li>There may as well be amity and life</li>
  <li>'Tween snow and fire, as treason and my love.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li>Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack,</li>
  <li>Where men enforced do speak anything.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BASSANIO</li>
  <li class="number">Promise me life, and I'll confess the truth.</li>
</ol>

  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li>Well then, confess and live.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BASSANIO</li>
  <li>'Confess' and 'love'</li>
  <li>Had been the very sum of my confession:</li>
  <li>O happy torment, when my torturer</li>
  <li class="number">Doth teach me answers for deliverance!</li>
  <li>But let me to my fortune and the caskets.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li>Away, then! I am lock'd in one of them:</li>
  <li>If you do love me, you will find me out.</li>
  <li>Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof.</li>
  <li class="number">Let music sound while he doth make his choice;</li>
  <li>Then, if he lose, he makes a swan-like end,</li>
  <li>Fading in music: that the comparison</li>
  <li>May stand more proper, my eye shall be the stream</li>
  <li>And watery death-bed for him. He may win;</li>
  <li class="number">And what is music then? Then music is</li>
  <li>Even as the flourish when true subjects bow</li>
  <li>To a new-crowned monarch: such it is</li>
  <li>As are those dulcet sounds in break of day</li>
  <li>That creep into the dreaming bridegroom's ear,</li>
  <li class="number">And summon him to marriage. Now he goes,</li>
  <li>With no less presence, but with much more love,</li>
  <li>Than young Alcides, when he did redeem</li>
  <li>The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy</li>
  <li>To the sea-monster: I stand for sacrifice</li>
  <li class="number">The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives,</li>
  <li>With bleared visages, come forth to view</li>
  <li>The issue of the exploit. Go, Hercules!</li>
  <li>Live thou, I live: with much, much more dismay</li>
  <li>I view the fight than thou that makest the fray.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Music, whilst BASSANIO comments on the caskets to himself</li>
  <li class="subhead">SONG.</li>
  <li class="number">Tell me where is fancy bred,</li>
  <li>Or in the heart, or in the head?</li>
  <li>How begot, how nourished?</li>
  <li>Reply, reply.</li>
  <li>It is engender'd in the eyes,</li>
  <li class="number">With gazing fed; and fancy dies</li>
  <li>In the cradle where it lies.</li>
  <li>Let us all ring fancy's knell</li>
  <li>I'll begin it —  Ding, dong, bell.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ALL</li>
  <li>Ding, dong, bell.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BASSANIO</li>
  <li class="number">So may the outward shows be least themselves:</li>
  <li>The world is still deceived with ornament.</li>
  <li>In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt,</li>
  <li>But, being seasoned with a gracious voice,</li>
  <li>Obscures the show of evil? In religion,</li>
  <li class="number">What damned error, but some sober brow</li>
  <li>Will bless it and approve it with a text,</li>
  <li>Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?</li>
  <li>There is no vice so simple but assumes</li>
  <li>Some mark of virtue on his outward parts:</li>
  <li class="number">How many cowards, whose hearts are all as false</li>
  <li>As stairs of sand, wear yet upon their chins</li>
  <li>The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars;</li>
  <li>Who, inward search'd, have livers white as milk;</li>
  <li>And these assume but valour's excrement</li>
  <li class="number">To render them redoubted! Look on beauty,</li>
  <li>And you shall see 'tis purchased by the weight;</li>
  <li>Which therein works a miracle in nature,</li>
  <li>Making them lightest that wear most of it:</li>
  <li>So are those crisped snaky golden locks</li>
  <li class="number">Which make such wanton gambols with the wind,</li>
  <li>Upon supposed fairness, often known</li>
  <li>To be the dowry of a second head,</li>
  <li>The skull that bred them in the sepulchre.</li>
  <li>Thus ornament is but the guiled shore</li>
  <li class="number">To a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf</li>
  <li>Veiling an Indian beauty; in a word,</li>
  <li>The seeming truth which cunning times put on</li>
  <li>To entrap the wisest. Therefore, thou gaudy gold,</li>
  <li>Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee;</li>
  <li class="number">Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge</li>
  <li>'Tween man and man: but thou, thou meagre lead,</li>
  <li>Which rather threatenest than dost promise aught,</li>
  <li>Thy paleness moves me more than eloquence;</li>
  <li>And here choose I; joy be the consequence!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li class="number">Aside  How all the other passions fleet to air,</li>
  <li>As doubtful thoughts, and rash-embraced despair,</li>
  <li>And shuddering fear, and green-eyed jealousy! O love,</li>
  <li>Be moderate; allay thy ecstasy,</li>
  <li>In measure rein thy joy; scant this excess.</li>
  <li class="number">I feel too much thy blessing: make it less,</li>
  <li>For fear I surfeit.</li>

  <li class="speaker">BASSANIO</li>
  <li>What find I here?</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Opening the leaden casket</li>
  <li>Fair Portia's counterfeit! What demi-god</li>
  <li>Hath come so near creation? Move these eyes?</li>
  <li class="number">Or whether, riding on the balls of mine,</li>
  <li>Seem they in motion? Here are sever'd lips,</li>
  <li>Parted with sugar breath: so sweet a bar</li>
  <li>Should sunder such sweet friends. Here in her hairs</li>
  <li>The painter plays the spider and hath woven</li>
  <li class="number">A golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men,</li>
  <li>Faster than gnats in cobwebs; but her eyes —  </li>
  <li>How could he see to do them? having made one,</li>
  <li>Methinks it should have power to steal both his</li>
  <li>And leave itself unfurnish'd. Yet look, how far</li>
  <li class="number">The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow</li>
  <li>In underprizing it, so far this shadow</li>
  <li>Doth limp behind the substance. Here's the scroll,</li>
  <li>The continent and summary of my fortune.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Reads</li>
  <li>You that choose not by the view,</li>
  <li class="number">Chance as fair and choose as true!</li>
  <li>Since this fortune falls to you,</li>

  <li>If you be well pleased with this</li>
  <li>And hold your fortune for your bliss,</li>
  <li class="number">Turn you where your lady is</li>
  <li>And claim her with a loving kiss.</li>
  <li>A gentle scroll. Fair lady, by your leave;</li>
  <li>I come by note, to give and to receive.</li>
  <li>Like one of two contending in a prize,</li>
  <li class="number">That thinks he hath done well in people's eyes,</li>
  <li>Hearing applause and universal shout,</li>
  <li>Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt</li>
  <li>Whether these pearls of praise be his or no;</li>
  <li>So, thrice fair lady, stand I, even so;</li>
  <li class="number">As doubtful whether what I see be true,</li>
  <li>Until confirm'd, sign'd, ratified by you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li>You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand,</li>
  <li>Such as I am: though for myself alone</li>
  <li>I would not be ambitious in my wish,</li>
  <li class="number">To wish myself much better; yet, for you</li>
  <li>I would be trebled twenty times myself;</li>
  <li>A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times more rich;</li>
  <li>That only to stand high in your account,</li>
  <li>I might in virtue, beauties, livings, friends,</li>
  <li class="number">Exceed account; but the full sum of me</li>
  <li>Is sum of something, which, to term in gross,</li>
  <li>Is an unlesson'd girl, unschool'd, unpractised;</li>
  <li>Happy in this, she is not yet so old</li>
  <li>But she may learn; happier than this,</li>
  <li class="number">She is not bred so dull but she can learn;</li>
  <li>Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit</li>
  <li>Commits itself to yours to be directed,</li>
  <li>As from her lord, her governor, her king.</li>
  <li>Myself and what is mine to you and yours</li>
  <li class="number">Is now converted: but now I was the lord</li>

  <li>Queen o'er myself: and even now, but now,</li>
  <li>This house, these servants and this same myself</li>
  <li>Are yours, my lord: I give them with this ring;</li>
  <li class="number">Which when you part from, lose, or give away,</li>
  <li>Let it presage the ruin of your love</li>

  <li class="speaker">BASSANIO</li>
  <li>Madam, you have bereft me of all words,</li>
  <li>Only my blood speaks to you in my veins;</li>

  <li>Where every something, being blent together,</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter LORENZO, JESSICA, and SALERIO, a Messenger

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BASSANIO</li>
  <li>Lorenzo and Salerio, welcome hither;</li>
  <li>If that the youth of my new interest here</li>
  <li>Have power to bid you welcome. By your leave,</li>
  <li class="number">I bid my very friends and countrymen,</li>
  <li>Sweet Portia, welcome.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li>So do I, my lord:</li>
  <li>They are entirely welcome.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LORENZO</li>
  <li>I thank your honour. For my part, my lord,</li>
  <li class="number">My purpose was not to have seen you here;</li>
  <li>But meeting with Salerio by the way,</li>
  <li>He did entreat me, past all saying nay,</li>
  <li>To come with him along.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SALERIO</li>
  <li>I did, my lord;</li>
  <li class="number">And I have reason for it. Signior Antonio</li>
  <li>Commends him to you.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Gives Bassanio a letter</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BASSANIO</li>
  <li>Ere I ope his letter,</li>
  <li>I pray you, tell me how my good friend doth.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SALERIO</li>
  <li>Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind;</li>
  <li class="number">Nor well, unless in mind: his letter there</li>
  <li>Will show you his estate.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GRATIANO</li>
  <li>Nerissa, cheer yon stranger; bid her welcome.</li>
  <li>Your hand, Salerio: what's the news from Venice?</li>
  <li>How doth that royal merchant, good Antonio?</li>
  <li class="number">I know he will be glad of our success;</li>
  <li>We are the Jasons, we have won the fleece.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SALERIO</li>
  <li>I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li>There are some shrewd contents in yon same paper,</li>
  <li>That steals the colour from Bassanio's cheek:</li>
  <li class="number">Some dear friend dead; else nothing in the world</li>
  <li>Could turn so much the constitution</li>
  <li>Of any constant man. What, worse and worse!</li>
  <li>With leave, Bassanio: I am half yourself,</li>
  <li>And I must freely have the half of anything</li>
  <li class="number">That this same paper brings you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BASSANIO</li>
  <li>O sweet Portia,</li>
  <li>Here are a few of the unpleasant'st words</li>
  <li>That ever blotted paper! Gentle lady,</li>
  <li>When I did first impart my love to you,</li>
  <li class="number">I freely told you, all the wealth I had</li>
  <li>Ran in my veins, I was a gentleman;</li>
  <li>And then I told you true: and yet, dear lady,</li>
  <li>Rating myself at nothing, you shall see</li>
  <li>How much I was a braggart. When I told you</li>
  <li class="number">My state was nothing, I should then have told you</li>
  <li>That I was worse than nothing; for, indeed,</li>
  <li>I have engaged myself to a dear friend,</li>
  <li>Engaged my friend to his mere enemy,</li>
  <li>To feed my means. Here is a letter, lady;</li>
  <li class="number">The paper as the body of my friend,</li>
  <li>And every word in it a gaping wound,</li>
  <li>Issuing life-blood. But is it true, Salerio?</li>
  <li>Have all his ventures fail'd? What, not one hit?</li>
  <li>From Tripolis, from Mexico and England,</li>
  <li class="number">From Lisbon, Barbary and India?</li>
  <li>And not one vessel 'scape the dreadful touch</li>
  <li>Of merchant-marring rocks?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SALERIO</li>
  <li>Not one, my lord.</li>
  <li>Besides, it should appear, that if he had</li>
  <li class="number">The present money to discharge the Jew,</li>
  <li>He would not take it. Never did I know</li>
  <li>A creature, that did bear the shape of man,</li>
  <li>So keen and greedy to confound a man:</li>
  <li>He plies the duke at morning and at night,</li>
  <li class="number">And doth impeach the freedom of the state,</li>
  <li>If they deny him justice: twenty merchants,</li>
  <li>The duke himself, and the magnificoes</li>
  <li>Of greatest port, have all persuaded with him;</li>
  <li>But none can drive him from the envious plea</li>
  <li class="number">Of forfeiture, of justice and his bond.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">JESSICA</li>
  <li>When I was with him I have heard him swear</li>
  <li>To Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen,</li>
  <li>That he would rather have Antonio's flesh</li>
  <li>Than twenty times the value of the sum</li>
  <li class="number">That he did owe him: and I know, my lord,</li>
  <li>If law, authority and power deny not,</li>
  <li>It will go hard with poor Antonio.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li>Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BASSANIO</li>
  <li>The dearest friend to me, the kindest man,</li>
  <li class="number">The best-condition'd and unwearied spirit</li>
  <li>In doing courtesies, and one in whom</li>
  <li>The ancient Roman honour more appears</li>
  <li>Than any that draws breath in Italy.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li>What sum owes he the Jew?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li>What, no more?</li>
  <li>Pay him six thousand, and deface the bond;</li>
  <li>Double six thousand, and then treble that,</li>
  <li>Before a friend of this description</li>
  <li class="number">Shall lose a hair through Bassanio's fault.</li>
  <li>First go with me to church and call me wife,</li>
  <li>And then away to Venice to your friend;</li>
  <li>For never shall you lie by Portia's side</li>
  <li>With an unquiet soul. You shall have gold</li>
  <li class="number">To pay the petty debt twenty times over:</li>
  <li>When it is paid, bring your true friend along.</li>
  <li>My maid Nerissa and myself meantime</li>
  <li>Will live as maids and widows. Come, away!</li>
  <li>For you shall hence upon your wedding-day:</li>
  <li class="number">Bid your friends welcome, show a merry cheer:</li>
  <li>Since you are dear bought, I will love you dear.</li>
  <li>But let me hear the letter of your friend.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BASSANIO</li>
  <li>Reads  Sweet Bassanio, my ships have all</li>
  <li>miscarried, my creditors grow cruel, my estate is</li>
  <li class="number">very low, my bond to the Jew is forfeit; and since</li>
  <li>in paying it, it is impossible I should live, all</li>
  <li>debts are cleared between you and I, if I might but</li>
  <li>see you at my death. Notwithstanding, use your</li>
  <li>pleasure: if your love do not persuade you to come,</li>
  <li class="number">let not my letter.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li>O love, dispatch all business, and be gone!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BASSANIO</li>
  <li>Since I have your good leave to go away,</li>
  <li>I will make haste: but, till I come again,</li>
  <li>No bed shall e'er be guilty of my stay,</li>
  <li class="number">No rest be interposer 'twixt us twain.</li>

  <li class="speaker">LORENZO</li>
  <li>Madam, although I speak it in your presence,</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>

  <li>How little is the cost I have bestow'd</li>

  <li>Why, if two gods should play some heavenly match</li>
  <li>And on the wager lay two earthly women,</li>
  <li class="number">And Portia one, there must be something else</li>
  <li>Pawn'd with the other, for the poor rude world</li>
  <li>Hath not her fellow.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LORENZO</li>
  <li>Even such a husband</li>
  <li>Hast thou of me as she is for a wife.</li>

  <li class="speaker">JESSICA</li>
  <li class="number">Nay, but ask my opinion too of that.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LORENZO</li>
  <li>I will anon: first, let us go to dinner.</li>

  <li>Nay, let me praise you while I have a stomach.</li>

  <li>No, pray thee, let it serve for table-talk;</li>

<h2>ACT IV</h2>

<section class="scene">

<h3>SCENE I.  Venice. A court of justice.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter the DUKE, the Magnificoes, ANTONIO, BASSANIO,
GRATIANO, SALERIO, and others</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DUKE</li>
  <li>What, is Antonio here?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ANTONIO</li>
  <li>Ready, so please your grace.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DUKE</li>
  <li>I am sorry for thee: thou art come to answer</li>
  <li>A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch</li>
  <li class="number">uncapable of pity, void and empty</li>
  <li>From any dram of mercy.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ANTONIO</li>
  <li>I have heard</li>
  <li>Your grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify</li>
  <li>His rigorous course; but since he stands obdurate</li>
  <li class="number">And that no lawful means can carry me</li>
  <li>Out of his envy's reach, I do oppose</li>
  <li>My patience to his fury, and am arm'd</li>
  <li>To suffer, with a quietness of spirit,</li>
  <li>The very tyranny and rage of his.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DUKE</li>
  <li class="number">Go one, and call the Jew into the court.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SALERIO</li>
  <li>He is ready at the door: he comes, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter SHYLOCK</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DUKE</li>
  <li>Make room, and let him stand before our face.</li>
  <li>Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too,</li>
  <li>That thou but lead'st this fashion of thy malice</li>
  <li class="number">To the last hour of act; and then 'tis thought</li>
  <li>Thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange</li>
  <li>Than is thy strange apparent cruelty;</li>
  <li>And where thou now exact'st the penalty,</li>
  <li>Which is a pound of this poor merchant's flesh,</li>
  <li class="number">Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture,</li>
  <li>But, touch'd with human gentleness and love,</li>
  <li>Forgive a moiety of the principal;</li>
  <li>Glancing an eye of pity on his losses,</li>
  <li>That have of late so huddled on his back,</li>
  <li class="number">Enow to press a royal merchant down</li>
  <li>And pluck commiseration of his state</li>
  <li>From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint,</li>
  <li>From stubborn Turks and Tartars, never train'd</li>
  <li>To offices of tender courtesy.</li>
  <li class="number">We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SHYLOCK</li>
  <li>I have possess'd your grace of what I purpose;</li>
  <li>And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn</li>
  <li>To have the due and forfeit of my bond:</li>
  <li>If you deny it, let the danger light</li>
  <li class="number">Upon your charter and your city's freedom.</li>
  <li>You'll ask me, why I rather choose to have</li>
  <li>A weight of carrion flesh than to receive</li>
  <li>Three thousand ducats: I'll not answer that:</li>
  <li>But, say, it is my humour: is it answer'd?</li>
  <li class="number">What if my house be troubled with a rat</li>
  <li>And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats</li>
  <li>To have it baned? What, are you answer'd yet?</li>
  <li>Some men there are love not a gaping pig;</li>
  <li>Some, that are mad if they behold a cat;</li>
  <li class="number">And others, when the bagpipe sings i' the nose,</li>
  <li>Cannot contain their urine: for affection,</li>
  <li>Mistress of passion, sways it to the mood</li>
  <li>Of what it likes or loathes. Now, for your answer:</li>
  <li>As there is no firm reason to be render'd,</li>
  <li class="number">Why he cannot abide a gaping pig;</li>
  <li>Why he, a harmless necessary cat;</li>
  <li>Why he, a woollen bagpipe; but of force</li>
  <li>Must yield to such inevitable shame</li>
  <li>As to offend, himself being offended;</li>
  <li class="number">So can I give no reason, nor I will not,</li>
  <li>More than a lodged hate and a certain loathing</li>
  <li>I bear Antonio, that I follow thus</li>
  <li>A losing suit against him. Are you answer'd?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BASSANIO</li>
  <li>This is no answer, thou unfeeling man,</li>
  <li class="number">To excuse the current of thy cruelty.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SHYLOCK</li>
  <li>I am not bound to please thee with my answers.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BASSANIO</li>
  <li>Do all men kill the things they do not love?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SHYLOCK</li>
  <li>Hates any man the thing he would not kill?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BASSANIO</li>
  <li>Every offence is not a hate at first.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SHYLOCK</li>
  <li class="number">What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ANTONIO</li>
  <li>I pray you, think you question with the Jew:</li>
  <li>You may as well go stand upon the beach</li>
  <li>And bid the main flood bate his usual height;</li>
  <li>You may as well use question with the wolf</li>
  <li class="number">Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb;</li>
  <li>You may as well forbid the mountain pines</li>
  <li>To wag their high tops and to make no noise,</li>
  <li>When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven;</li>
  <li>You may as well do anything most hard,</li>
  <li class="number">As seek to soften that — than which what's harder? — </li>
  <li>His Jewish heart: therefore, I do beseech you,</li>
  <li>Make no more offers, use no farther means,</li>
  <li>But with all brief and plain conveniency</li>
  <li>Let me have judgment and the Jew his will.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BASSANIO</li>
  <li class="number">For thy three thousand ducats here is six.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SHYLOCK</li>
  <li>What judgment shall I dread, doing</li>
  <li>Were in six parts and every part a ducat,</li>
  <li>I would not draw them; I would have my bond.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DUKE</li>
  <li>How shalt thou hope for mercy, rendering none?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SHYLOCK</li>
  <li class="number">What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?</li>
  <li>You have among you many a purchased slave,</li>
  <li>Which, like your asses and your dogs and mules,</li>
  <li>You use in abject and in slavish parts,</li>
  <li>Because you bought them: shall I say to you,</li>
  <li class="number">Let them be free, marry them to your heirs?</li>
  <li>Why sweat they under burthens? let their beds</li>
  <li>Be made as soft as yours and let their palates</li>
  <li>Be season'd with such viands? You will answer</li>
  <li>'The slaves are ours:' so do I answer you:</li>
  <li class="number">The pound of flesh, which I demand of him,</li>
  <li>Is dearly bought; 'tis mine and I will have it.</li>
  <li>If you deny me, fie upon your law!</li>
  <li>There is no force in the decrees of Venice.</li>
  <li>I stand for judgment: answer; shall I have it?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DUKE</li>
  <li class="number">Upon my power I may dismiss this court,</li>
  <li>Unless Bellario, a learned doctor,</li>
  <li>Whom I have sent for to determine this,</li>
  <li>Come here to-day.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SALERIO</li>
  <li>My lord, here stays without</li>
  <li class="number">A messenger with letters from the doctor,</li>
  <li>New come from Padua.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DUKE</li>
  <li>Bring us the letter; call the messenger.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BASSANIO</li>
  <li>Good cheer, Antonio! What, man, courage yet!</li>
  <li>The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones and all,</li>
  <li class="number">Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ANTONIO</li>
  <li>I am a tainted wether of the flock,</li>
  <li>Meetest for death: the weakest kind of fruit</li>
  <li>Drops earliest to the ground; and so let me</li>
  <li>You cannot better be employ'd, Bassanio,</li>
  <li class="number">Than to live still and write mine epitaph.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter NERISSA, dressed like a lawyer's clerk</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DUKE</li>
  <li>Came you from Padua, from Bellario?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NERISSA</li>
  <li>From both, my lord. Bellario greets your grace.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Presenting a letter</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BASSANIO</li>
  <li>Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SHYLOCK</li>
  <li>To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GRATIANO</li>
  <li class="number">Not on thy sole, but on thy soul, harsh Jew,</li>
  <li>Thou makest thy knife keen; but no metal can,</li>
  <li>No, not the hangman's axe, bear half the keenness</li>
  <li>Of thy sharp envy. Can no prayers pierce thee?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SHYLOCK</li>
  <li>No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GRATIANO</li>
  <li class="number">O, be thou damn'd, inexecrable dog!</li>
  <li>And for thy life let justice be accused.</li>
  <li>Thou almost makest me waver in my faith</li>
  <li>To hold opinion with Pythagoras,</li>
  <li>That souls of animals infuse themselves</li>
  <li class="number">Into the trunks of men: thy currish spirit</li>
  <li>Govern'd a wolf, who, hang'd for human slaughter,</li>
  <li>Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet,</li>
  <li>And, whilst thou lay'st in thy unhallow'd dam,</li>
  <li>Infused itself in thee; for thy desires</li>
  <li class="number">Are wolvish, bloody, starved and ravenous.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SHYLOCK</li>
  <li>Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond,</li>
  <li>Thou but offend'st thy lungs to speak so loud:</li>
  <li>Repair thy wit, good youth, or it will fall</li>
  <li>To cureless ruin. I stand here for law.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DUKE</li>
  <li class="number">This letter from Bellario doth commend</li>
  <li>A young and learned doctor to our court.</li>
  <li>Where is he?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NERISSA</li>
  <li>He attendeth here hard by,</li>
  <li>To know your answer, whether you'll admit him.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DUKE</li>
  <li class="number">With all my heart. Some three or four of you</li>
  <li>Go give him courteous conduct to this place.</li>
  <li>Meantime the court shall hear Bellario's letter.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Clerk</li>
  <li>Reads</li>
  <li>Your grace shall understand that at the receipt of</li>
  <li class="number">your letter I am very sick: but in the instant that</li>
  <li>your messenger came, in loving visitation was with</li>
  <li>me a young doctor of Rome; his name is Balthasar. I</li>
  <li>acquainted him with the cause in controversy between</li>
  <li>the Jew and Antonio the merchant: we turned o'er</li>
  <li class="number">many books together: he is furnished with my</li>
  <li>opinion; which, bettered with his own learning, the</li>
  <li>greatness whereof I cannot enough commend, comes</li>
  <li>with him, at my importunity, to fill up your grace's</li>
  <li>request in my stead. I beseech you, let his lack of</li>
  <li class="number">years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend</li>
  <li>estimation; for I never knew so young a body with so</li>
  <li>old a head. I leave him to your gracious</li>
  <li>acceptance, whose trial shall better publish his</li>
  <li>commendation.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DUKE</li>
  <li class="number">You hear the learn'd Bellario, what he writes:</li>
  <li>And here, I take it, is the doctor come.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Enter PORTIA, dressed like a doctor of laws</li>
  <li>Give me your hand. Come you from old Bellario?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li>I did, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DUKE</li>
  <li>You are welcome: take your place.</li>
  <li class="number">Are you acquainted with the difference</li>
  <li>That holds this present question in the court?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li>I am informed thoroughly of the cause.</li>
  <li>Which is the merchant here, and which the Jew?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DUKE</li>
  <li>Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li class="number">Is your name Shylock?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SHYLOCK</li>
  <li>Shylock is my name.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li>Of a strange nature is the suit you follow;</li>
  <li>Yet in such rule that the Venetian law</li>
  <li>Cannot impugn you as you do proceed.</li>
  <li class="number">You stand within his danger, do you not?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ANTONIO</li>
  <li>Ay, so he says.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li>Do you confess the bond?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ANTONIO</li>
  <li>I do.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li>Then must the Jew be merciful.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SHYLOCK</li>
  <li class="number">On what compulsion must I? tell me that.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li>The quality of mercy is not strain'd,</li>
  <li>It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven</li>
  <li>Upon the place beneath: it is twice blest;</li>
  <li>It blesseth him that gives and him that takes:</li>
  <li class="number">'Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes</li>
  <li>The throned monarch better than his crown;</li>
  <li>His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,</li>
  <li>The attribute to awe and majesty,</li>
  <li>Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;</li>
  <li class="number">But mercy is above this sceptred sway;</li>
  <li>It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,</li>
  <li>It is an attribute to God himself;</li>
  <li>And earthly power doth then show likest God's</li>
  <li>When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,</li>
  <li class="number">Though justice be thy plea, consider this,</li>
  <li>That, in the course of justice, none of us</li>
  <li>Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;</li>
  <li>And that same prayer doth teach us all to render</li>
  <li>The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much</li>
  <li class="number">To mitigate the justice of thy plea;</li>
  <li>Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice</li>
  <li>Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SHYLOCK</li>
  <li>My deeds upon my head! I crave the law,</li>
  <li>The penalty and forfeit of my bond.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li class="number">Is he not able to discharge the money?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BASSANIO</li>
  <li>Yes, here I tender it for him in the court;</li>
  <li>Yea, twice the sum: if that will not suffice,</li>
  <li>I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er,</li>
  <li>On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart:</li>
  <li class="number">If this will not suffice, it must appear</li>
  <li>That malice bears down truth. And I beseech you,</li>
  <li>Wrest once the law to your authority:</li>
  <li>To do a great right, do a little wrong,</li>
  <li>And curb this cruel devil of his will.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li class="number">It must not be; there is no power in Venice</li>
  <li>Can alter a decree established:</li>
  <li>'Twill be recorded for a precedent,</li>
  <li>And many an error by the same example</li>
  <li>Will rush into the state: it cannot be.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SHYLOCK</li>
  <li class="number">A Daniel come to judgment! yea, a Daniel!</li>
  <li>O wise young judge, how I do honour thee!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li>I pray you, let me look upon the bond.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SHYLOCK</li>
  <li>Here 'tis, most reverend doctor, here it is.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li>Shylock, there's thrice thy money offer'd thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SHYLOCK</li>
  <li class="number">An oath, an oath, I have an oath in heaven:</li>
  <li>Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?</li>
  <li>No, not for Venice.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li>Why, this bond is forfeit;</li>
  <li>And lawfully by this the Jew may claim</li>
  <li class="number">A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off</li>
  <li>Nearest the merchant's heart. Be merciful:</li>
  <li>Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SHYLOCK</li>
  <li>When it is paid according to the tenor.</li>
  <li>It doth appear you are a worthy judge;</li>
  <li class="number">You know the law, your exposition</li>
  <li>Hath been most sound: I charge you by the law,</li>
  <li>Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar,</li>
  <li>Proceed to judgment: by my soul I swear</li>
  <li>There is no power in the tongue of man</li>
  <li class="number">To alter me: I stay here on my bond.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ANTONIO</li>
  <li>Most heartily I do beseech the court</li>
  <li>To give the judgment.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li>Why then, thus it is:</li>
  <li>You must prepare your bosom for his knife.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SHYLOCK</li>
  <li class="number">O noble judge! O excellent young man!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li>For the intent and purpose of the law</li>
  <li>Hath full relation to the penalty,</li>
  <li>Which here appeareth due upon the bond.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SHYLOCK</li>
  <li>'Tis very true: O wise and upright judge!</li>
  <li class="number">How much more elder art thou than thy looks!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li>Therefore lay bare your bosom.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SHYLOCK</li>
  <li>Ay, his breast:</li>
  <li>So says the bond: doth it not, noble judge?</li>
  <li>'Nearest his heart:' those are the very words.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li class="number">It is so. Are there balance here to weigh</li>
  <li>The flesh?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SHYLOCK</li>
  <li>I have them ready.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li>Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,</li>
  <li>To stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SHYLOCK</li>
  <li class="number">Is it so nominated in the bond?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li>It is not so express'd: but what of that?</li>
  <li>'Twere good you do so much for charity.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SHYLOCK</li>
  <li>I cannot find it; 'tis not in the bond.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li>You, merchant, have you any thing to say?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ANTONIO</li>
  <li class="number">But little: I am arm'd and well prepared.</li>
  <li>Give me your hand, Bassanio: fare you well!</li>
  <li>Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you;</li>
  <li>For herein Fortune shows herself more kind</li>
  <li>Than is her custom: it is still her use</li>
  <li class="number">To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,</li>
  <li>To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow</li>
  <li>An age of poverty; from which lingering penance</li>
  <li>Of such misery doth she cut me off.</li>
  <li>Commend me to your honourable wife:</li>
  <li class="number">Tell her the process of Antonio's end;</li>
  <li>Say how I loved you, speak me fair in death;</li>
  <li>And, when the tale is told, bid her be judge</li>
  <li>Whether Bassanio had not once a love.</li>
  <li>Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,</li>
  <li class="number">And he repents not that he pays your debt;</li>
  <li>For if the Jew do cut but deep enough,</li>

  <li>Here to this devil, to deliver you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>

  <li>I have a wife, whom, I protest, I love:</li>

  <li class="number">But, in the cutting it, if thou dost shed</li>
  <li>One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods</li>

  <li>Or any air of music touch their ears,</li>
  <li>You shall perceive them make a mutual stand,</li>
  <li class="number">Their savage eyes turn'd to a modest gaze</li>
  <li>By the sweet power of music: therefore the poet</li>
  <li>Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones and floods;</li>
  <li>Since nought so stockish, hard and full of rage,</li>
  <li>But music for the time doth change his nature.</li>
  <li class="number">The man that hath no music in himself,</li>
  <li>Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,</li>
  <li>Is fit for treasons, stratagems and spoils;</li>
  <li>The motions of his spirit are dull as night</li>
  <li>And his affections dark as Erebus:</li>
  <li class="number">Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music.</li>

  <li class="speaker">BASSANIO</li>
  <li>I thank you, madam. Give welcome to my friend.</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li>You should in all sense be much bound to him.</li>

  <li class="number">Sir, you are very welcome to our house:</li>
  <li>It must appear in other ways than words,</li>
  <li>Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GRATIANO</li>
  <li>To NERISSA  By yonder moon I swear you do me wrong;</li>
  <li>In faith, I gave it to the judge's clerk:</li>
  <li class="number">Would he were gelt that had it, for my part,</li>
  <li>Since you do take it, love, so much at heart.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li>A quarrel, ho, already! what's the matter?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GRATIANO</li>
  <li>About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring</li>
  <li>That she did give me, whose posy was</li>
  <li class="number">For all the world like cutler's poetry</li>
  <li>Upon a knife, 'Love me, and leave me not.'</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NERISSA</li>
  <li>What talk you of the posy or the value?</li>
  <li>You swore to me, when I did give it you,</li>
  <li>That you would wear it till your hour of death</li>
  <li class="number">And that it should lie with you in your grave:</li>
  <li>Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,</li>
  <li>You should have been respective and have kept it.</li>
  <li>Gave it a judge's clerk! no, God's my judge,</li>
  <li>The clerk will ne'er wear hair on's face that had it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GRATIANO</li>
  <li class="number">He will, an if he live to be a man.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NERISSA</li>
  <li>Ay, if a woman live to be a man.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GRATIANO</li>
  <li>Now, by this hand, I gave it to a youth,</li>
  <li>A kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy,</li>
  <li>No higher than thyself; the judge's clerk,</li>
  <li class="number">A prating boy, that begg'd it as a fee:</li>
  <li>I could not for my heart deny it him.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li>You were to blame, I must be plain with you,</li>
  <li>To part so slightly with your wife's first gift:</li>
  <li>A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger</li>
  <li class="number">And so riveted with faith unto your flesh.</li>
  <li>I gave my love a ring and made him swear</li>
  <li>Never to part with it; and here he stands;</li>
  <li>I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it</li>
  <li>Nor pluck it from his finger, for the wealth</li>
  <li class="number">That the world masters. Now, in faith, Gratiano,</li>
  <li>You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief:</li>
  <li>An 'twere to me, I should be mad at it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BASSANIO</li>
  <li>Aside  Why, I were best to cut my left hand off</li>
  <li>And swear I lost the ring defending it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GRATIANO</li>
  <li class="number">My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away</li>
  <li>Unto the judge that begg'd it and indeed</li>
  <li>Deserved it too; and then the boy, his clerk,</li>
  <li>That took some pains in writing, he begg'd mine;</li>
  <li>And neither man nor master would take aught</li>
  <li class="number">But the two rings.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li>What ring gave you my lord?</li>
  <li>Not that, I hope, which you received of me.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BASSANIO</li>
  <li>If I could add a lie unto a fault,</li>
  <li>I would deny it; but you see my finger</li>
  <li class="number">Hath not the ring upon it; it is gone.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li>Even so void is your false heart of truth.</li>
  <li>By heaven, I will ne'er come in your bed</li>
  <li>Until I see the ring.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NERISSA</li>
  <li>Nor I in yours</li>
  <li class="number">Till I again see mine.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BASSANIO</li>
  <li>Sweet Portia,</li>
  <li>If you did know to whom I gave the ring,</li>
  <li>If you did know for whom I gave the ring</li>
  <li>And would conceive for what I gave the ring</li>
  <li class="number">And how unwillingly I left the ring,</li>
  <li>When nought would be accepted but the ring,</li>
  <li>You would abate the strength of your displeasure.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li>If you had known the virtue of the ring,</li>
  <li>Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,</li>
  <li class="number">Or your own honour to contain the ring,</li>
  <li>You would not then have parted with the ring.</li>
  <li>What man is there so much unreasonable,</li>
  <li>If you had pleased to have defended it</li>
  <li>With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty</li>
  <li class="number">To urge the thing held as a ceremony?</li>
  <li>Nerissa teaches me what to believe:</li>
  <li>I'll die for't but some woman had the ring.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BASSANIO</li>
  <li>No, by my honour, madam, by my soul,</li>
  <li>No woman had it, but a civil doctor,</li>
  <li class="number">Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me</li>
  <li>And begg'd the ring; the which I did deny him</li>
  <li>And suffer'd him to go displeased away;</li>
  <li>Even he that did uphold the very life</li>
  <li>Of my dear friend. What should I say, sweet lady?</li>
  <li class="number">I was enforced to send it after him;</li>
  <li>I was beset with shame and courtesy;</li>
  <li>My honour would not let ingratitude</li>
  <li>So much besmear it. Pardon me, good lady;</li>
  <li>For, by these blessed candles of the night,</li>
  <li class="number">Had you been there, I think you would have begg'd</li>
  <li>The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li>Let not that doctor e'er come near my house:</li>
  <li>Since he hath got the jewel that I loved,</li>
  <li>And that which you did swear to keep for me,</li>
  <li class="number">I will become as liberal as you;</li>
  <li>I'll not deny him any thing I have,</li>
  <li>No, not my body nor my husband's bed:</li>
  <li>Know him I shall, I am well sure of it:</li>
  <li>Lie not a night from home; watch me like Argus:</li>
  <li class="number">If you do not, if I be left alone,</li>
  <li>Now, by mine honour, which is yet mine own,</li>
  <li>I'll have that doctor for my bedfellow.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NERISSA</li>
  <li>And I his clerk; therefore be well advised</li>
  <li>How you do leave me to mine own protection.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GRATIANO</li>
  <li class="number">Well, do you so; let not me take him, then;</li>
  <li>For if I do, I'll mar the young clerk's pen.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ANTONIO</li>
  <li>I am the unhappy subject of these quarrels.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li>Sir, grieve not you; you are welcome notwithstanding.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BASSANIO</li>
  <li>Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong;</li>
  <li class="number">And, in the hearing of these many friends,</li>
  <li>I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes,</li>
  <li>Wherein I see myself — </li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li>Mark you but that!</li>
  <li>In both my eyes he doubly sees himself;</li>
  <li class="number">In each eye, one: swear by your double self,</li>
  <li>And there's an oath of credit.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BASSANIO</li>
  <li>Nay, but hear me:</li>
  <li>Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear</li>
  <li>I never more will break an oath with thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ANTONIO</li>
  <li class="number">I once did lend my body for his wealth;</li>
  <li>Which, but for him that had your husband's ring,</li>
  <li>Had quite miscarried: I dare be bound again,</li>
  <li>My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord</li>
  <li>Will never more break faith advisedly.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li class="number">Then you shall be his surety. Give him this</li>
  <li>And bid him keep it better than the other.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ANTONIO</li>
  <li>Here, Lord Bassanio; swear to keep this ring.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BASSANIO</li>
  <li>By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li>I had it of him: pardon me, Bassanio;</li>
  <li class="number">For, by this ring, the doctor lay with me.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NERISSA</li>
  <li>And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano;</li>
  <li>For that same scrubbed boy, the doctor's clerk,</li>
  <li>In lieu of this last night did lie with me.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GRATIANO</li>
  <li>Why, this is like the mending of highways</li>
  <li class="number">In summer, where the ways are fair enough:</li>
  <li>What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li>Speak not so grossly. You are all amazed:</li>
  <li>Here is a letter; read it at your leisure;</li>
  <li>It comes from Padua, from Bellario:</li>
  <li class="number">There you shall find that Portia was the doctor,</li>
  <li>Nerissa there her clerk: Lorenzo here</li>
  <li>Shall witness I set forth as soon as you</li>
  <li>And even but now return'd; I have not yet</li>
  <li>Enter'd my house. Antonio, you are welcome;</li>
  <li class="number">And I have better news in store for you</li>
  <li>Than you expect: unseal this letter soon;</li>
  <li>There you shall find three of your argosies</li>
  <li>Are richly come to harbour suddenly:</li>
  <li>You shall not know by what strange accident</li>
  <li class="number">I chanced on this letter.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ANTONIO</li>
  <li>I am dumb.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BASSANIO</li>
  <li>Were you the doctor and I knew you not?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GRATIANO</li>
  <li>Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NERISSA</li>
  <li>Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it,</li>
  <li class="number">Unless he live until he be a man.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BASSANIO</li>
  <li>Sweet doctor, you shall be my bed-fellow:</li>
  <li>When I am absent, then lie with my wife.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ANTONIO</li>
  <li>Sweet lady, you have given me life and living;</li>
  <li>For here I read for certain that my ships</li>
  <li class="number">Are safely come to road.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li>How now, Lorenzo!</li>
  <li>My clerk hath some good comforts too for you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NERISSA</li>
  <li>Ay, and I'll give them him without a fee.</li>
  <li>There do I give to you and Jessica,</li>
  <li class="number">From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,</li>
  <li>After his death, of all he dies possess'd of.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LORENZO</li>
  <li>Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way</li>
  <li>Of starved people.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PORTIA</li>
  <li>It is almost morning,</li>
  <li class="number">And yet I am sure you are not satisfied</li>
  <li>Of these events at full. Let us go in;</li>
  <li>And charge us there upon inter'gatories,</li>
  <li>And we will answer all things faithfully.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GRATIANO</li>
  <li>Let it be so: the first inter'gatory</li>
  <li class="number">That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is,</li>
  <li>Whether till the next night she had rather stay,</li>
  <li>Or go to bed now, being two hours to day:</li>
  <li>But were the day come, I should wish it dark,</li>
  <li>That I were couching with the doctor's clerk.</li>
  <li class="number">Well, while I live I'll fear no other thing</li>
  <li>So sore as keeping safe Nerissa's ring.</li>
