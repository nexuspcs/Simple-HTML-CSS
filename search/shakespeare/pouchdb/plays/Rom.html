<h3>SCENE I.  Verona. A public place.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet,
armed with swords and bucklers</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SAMPSON</li>
  <li>Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GREGORY</li>
  <li>No, for then we should be colliers.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SAMPSON</li>
  <li>I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GREGORY</li>
  <li>Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SAMPSON</li>
  <li class="number">I strike quickly, being moved.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GREGORY</li>
  <li>But thou art not quickly moved to strike.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SAMPSON</li>
  <li>A dog of the house of Montague moves me.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GREGORY</li>
  <li>To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:</li>
  <li>therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SAMPSON</li>
  <li class="number">A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will</li>
  <li>take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GREGORY</li>
  <li>That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes</li>
  <li>to the wall.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SAMPSON</li>
  <li>True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,</li>
  <li class="number">are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push</li>
  <li>Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids</li>
  <li>to the wall.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GREGORY</li>
  <li>The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SAMPSON</li>
  <li>'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I</li>
  <li class="number">have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the</li>
  <li>maids, and cut off their heads.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GREGORY</li>
  <li>The heads of the maids?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SAMPSON</li>
  <li>Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;</li>
  <li>take it in what sense thou wilt.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GREGORY</li>
  <li class="number">They must take it in sense that feel it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SAMPSON</li>
  <li>Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and</li>
  <li>'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GREGORY</li>
  <li>'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou</li>
  <li>hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes</li>
  <li class="number">two of the house of the Montagues.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SAMPSON</li>
  <li>My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GREGORY</li>
  <li>How! turn thy back and run?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SAMPSON</li>
  <li>Fear me not.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GREGORY</li>
  <li>No, marry; I fear thee!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SAMPSON</li>
  <li class="number">Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GREGORY</li>
  <li>I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as</li>
  <li>they list.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SAMPSON</li>
  <li>Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;</li>
  <li>which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR</div>

  <li class="speaker">SAMPSON</li>
  <li>I do bite my thumb, sir.</li>

  <li>Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?</li>

  <li>ay?</li>

  <li class="number">No.</li>
</ol>

  <li class="speaker">SAMPSON</li>
  <li>No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I</li>
  <li>bite my thumb, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GREGORY</li>
  <li>Do you quarrel, sir?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ABRAHAM</li>
  <li>Quarrel sir! no, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SAMPSON</li>
  <li class="number">If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.</li>
</ol>

  <li class="speaker">ABRAHAM</li>
  <li>No better.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SAMPSON</li>
  <li>Well, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GREGORY</li>
  <li>Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SAMPSON</li>
  <li>Yes, better, sir.</li>

  <li class="speaker">BENVOLIO</li>
  <li>Part, fools!</li>
  <li>Put up your swords; you know not what you do.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Beats down their swords</div>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter TYBALT</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TYBALT</li>
  <li>What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?</li>
  <li class="number">Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BENVOLIO</li>
  <li>I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,</li>
  <li>Or manage it to part these men with me.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TYBALT</li>
  <li>What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,</li>
  <li>As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:</li>
  <li class="number">Have at thee, coward!</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">They fight</div>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter, several of both houses, who join the fray;
then enter Citizens, with clubs</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Citizen</li>
  <li>Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!</li>
  <li>Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter CAPULET in his gown, and LADY CAPULET</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAPULET</li>
  <li>What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LADY CAPULET</li>
  <li>A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAPULET</li>
  <li class="number">My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,</li>
  <li>And flourishes his blade in spite of me.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MONTAGUE</li>
  <li>Thou villain Capulet —  Hold me not, let me go.</li>

  <li>Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter PRINCE, with Attendants</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE</li>
  <li>Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,</li>
  <li class="number">Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel —  </li>
  <li>Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,</li>
  <li>That quench the fire of your pernicious rage</li>
  <li>With purple fountains issuing from your veins,</li>
  <li>On pain of torture, from those bloody hands</li>
  <li class="number">Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,</li>
  <li>And hear the sentence of your moved prince.</li>
  <li>Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,</li>
  <li>By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,</li>
  <li>Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,</li>
  <li class="number">And made Verona's ancient citizens</li>
  <li>Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,</li>
  <li>To wield old partisans, in hands as old,</li>
  <li>Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:</li>
  <li>If ever you disturb our streets again,</li>
  <li class="number">Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.</li>
  <li>For this time, all the rest depart away:</li>
  <li>You Capulet; shall go along with me:</li>
  <li>And, Montague, come you this afternoon,</li>
  <li>To know our further pleasure in this case,</li>
  <li class="number">To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.</li>
  <li>Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt all but MONTAGUE, LADY MONTAGUE, and BENVOLIO</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MONTAGUE</li>
  <li>Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?</li>
  <li>Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BENVOLIO</li>
  <li>Here were the servants of your adversary,</li>
  <li class="number">And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:</li>
  <li>I drew to part them: in the instant came</li>
  <li>The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,</li>
  <li>Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,</li>
  <li>He swung about his head and cut the winds,</li>
  <li class="number">Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:</li>
  <li>While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,</li>
  <li>Came more and more and fought on part and part,</li>
  <li>Till the prince came, who parted either part.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LADY MONTAGUE</li>
  <li>O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?</li>
  <li class="number">Right glad I am he was not at this fray.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BENVOLIO</li>
  <li>Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun</li>
  <li>Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,</li>
  <li>A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;</li>
  <li>Where, underneath the grove of sycamore</li>
  <li class="number">That westward rooteth from the city's side,</li>
  <li>So early walking did I see your son:</li>
  <li>Towards him I made, but he was ware of me</li>
  <li>And stole into the covert of the wood:</li>
  <li>I, measuring his affections by my own,</li>
  <li class="number">That most are busied when they're most alone,</li>
  <li>Pursued my humour not pursuing his,</li>
  <li>And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MONTAGUE</li>
  <li>Many a morning hath he there been seen,</li>
  <li>With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.</li>
  <li class="number">Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;</li>
  <li>But all so soon as the all-cheering sun</li>
  <li>Should in the furthest east begin to draw</li>
  <li>The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,</li>
  <li>Away from the light steals home my heavy son,</li>
  <li class="number">And private in his chamber pens himself,</li>
  <li>Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out</li>
  <li>And makes himself an artificial night:</li>
  <li>Black and portentous must this humour prove,</li>
  <li>Unless good counsel may the cause remove.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BENVOLIO</li>
  <li class="number">My noble uncle, do you know the cause?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MONTAGUE</li>
  <li>I neither know it nor can learn of him.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BENVOLIO</li>
  <li>Have you importuned him by any means?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MONTAGUE</li>
  <li>Both by myself and many other friends:</li>
  <li>But he, his own affections' counsellor,</li>
  <li class="number">Is to himself — I will not say how true — </li>
  <li>But to himself so secret and so close,</li>
  <li>So far from sounding and discovery,</li>
  <li>As is the bud bit with an envious worm,</li>
  <li>Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,</li>
  <li class="number">Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.</li>
  <li>Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.</li>
  <li>We would as willingly give cure as know.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter ROMEO</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BENVOLIO</li>
  <li>See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;</li>
  <li>I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MONTAGUE</li>
  <li class="number">I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,</li>
  <li>To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BENVOLIO</li>
  <li>Good-morrow, cousin.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROMEO</li>
  <li>Is the day so young?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BENVOLIO</li>
  <li>But new struck nine.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROMEO</li>
  <li class="number">Ay me! sad hours seem long.</li>
  <li>Was that my father that went hence so fast?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BENVOLIO</li>
  <li>It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROMEO</li>
  <li>Not having that, which, having, makes them short.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BENVOLIO</li>
  <li>In love?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROMEO</li>
  <li class="number">Out — </li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BENVOLIO</li>
  <li>Of love?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROMEO</li>
  <li>Out of her favour, where I am in love.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BENVOLIO</li>
  <li>Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,</li>
  <li>Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROMEO</li>
  <li class="number">Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,</li>
  <li>Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!</li>
  <li>Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?</li>
  <li>Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.</li>
  <li>Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.</li>
  <li class="number">Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!</li>
  <li>O any thing, of nothing first create!</li>
  <li>O heavy lightness! serious vanity!</li>
  <li>Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!</li>
  <li>Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,</li>
  <li class="number">sick health!</li>
  <li>Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!</li>
  <li>This love feel I, that feel no love in this.</li>
  <li>Dost thou not laugh?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BENVOLIO</li>
  <li>No, coz, I rather weep.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROMEO</li>
  <li class="number">Good heart, at what?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BENVOLIO</li>
  <li>At thy good heart's oppression.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROMEO</li>
  <li>Why, such is love's transgression.</li>
  <li>Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,</li>
  <li>Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest</li>
  <li class="number">With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown</li>
  <li>Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.</li>
  <li>Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;</li>
  <li>Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;</li>
  <li>Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:</li>
  <li class="number">What is it else? a madness most discreet,</li>
  <li>A choking gall and a preserving sweet.</li>
  <li>Farewell, my coz.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BENVOLIO</li>
  <li>Soft! I will go along;</li>
  <li>An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROMEO</li>
  <li class="number">Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;</li>
  <li>This is not Romeo, he's some other where.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BENVOLIO</li>
  <li>Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROMEO</li>
  <li>What, shall I groan and tell thee?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BENVOLIO</li>
  <li>Groan! why, no.</li>
  <li class="number">But sadly tell me who.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROMEO</li>
  <li>Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:</li>
  <li>Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!</li>
  <li>In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BENVOLIO</li>
  <li>I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROMEO</li>
  <li class="number">A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BENVOLIO</li>
  <li>A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROMEO</li>
  <li>Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit</li>
  <li>With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;</li>
  <li>And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,</li>
  <li class="number">From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.</li>
  <li>She will not stay the siege of loving terms,</li>
  <li>Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,</li>
  <li>Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:</li>
  <li>O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,</li>
  <li class="number">That when she dies with beauty dies her store.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BENVOLIO</li>
  <li>Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROMEO</li>
  <li>She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,</li>
  <li>For beauty starved with her severity</li>
  <li>Cuts beauty off from all posterity.</li>
  <li class="number">She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,</li>
  <li>To merit bliss by making me despair:</li>
  <li>She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow</li>
  <li>Do I live dead that live to tell it now.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BENVOLIO</li>
  <li>Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROMEO</li>
  <li class="number">O, teach me how I should forget to think.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BENVOLIO</li>
  <li>By giving liberty unto thine eyes;</li>
  <li>Examine other beauties.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROMEO</li>
  <li>'Tis the way</li>
  <li>To call hers exquisite, in question more:</li>
  <li class="number">These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows</li>
  <li>Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;</li>
  <li>He that is strucken blind cannot forget</li>
  <li>The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:</li>
  <li>Show me a mistress that is passing fair,</li>
  <li class="number">What doth her beauty serve, but as a note</li>
  <li>Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?</li>
  <li>Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BENVOLIO</li>
  <li>I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.</li>

  <li class="number">This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,</li>

  <li>One desperate grief cures with another's languish:</li>

  <li>Susan and she — God rest all Christian souls! — </li>
  <li>Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;</li>
  <li>She was too good for me: but, as I said,</li>
  <li class="number">On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;</li>
  <li>That shall she, marry; I remember it well.</li>
  <li>'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;</li>
  <li>And she was wean'd —  I never shall forget it —  </li>
  <li>Of all the days of the year, upon that day:</li>
  <li class="number">For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,</li>
  <li>Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;</li>
  <li>My lord and you were then at Mantua: — </li>
  <li>Nay, I do bear a brain: — but, as I said,</li>
  <li>When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple</li>
  <li class="number">Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,</li>
  <li>To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!</li>
  <li>Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,</li>
  <li>To bid me trudge:</li>
  <li>And since that time it is eleven years;</li>
  <li class="number">For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,</li>
  <li>She could have run and waddled all about;</li>
  <li>For even the day before, she broke her brow:</li>
  <li>And then my husband — God be with his soul!</li>
  <li>A' was a merry man — took up the child:</li>
  <li class="number">'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?</li>
  <li>Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;</li>
  <li>Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,</li>
  <li>The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'</li>
  <li>To see, now, how a jest shall come about!</li>
  <li class="number">I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,</li>

  <li>Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,</li>

  <li>And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow</li>
  <li>A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;</li>
  <li>A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:</li>
  <li>'Yea,' quoth my husband,'fall'st upon thy face?</li>
  <li class="number">Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;</li>
  <li>Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'</li>

  <li>How stands your disposition to be married?</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">JULIET</li>

  <li class="speaker">LADY CAPULET</li>
  <li>Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,</li>
  <li>Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,</li>
  <li class="number">Are made already mothers: by my count,</li>
  <li>I was your mother much upon these years</li>
  <li>That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:</li>

  <li class="speaker">Nurse</li>
  <li>A man, young lady! lady, such a man</li>

  <li>And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;</li>
  <li>Examine every married lineament,</li>
  <li>And see how one another lends content</li>
  <li>And what obscured in this fair volume lies</li>
  <li class="number">Find written in the margent of his eyes.</li>
  <li>This precious book of love, this unbound lover,</li>
  <li>To beautify him, only lacks a cover:</li>
  <li>The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride</li>
  <li>For fair without the fair within to hide:</li>
  <li class="number">That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,</li>

  <li>So shall you share all that he doth possess,</li>
  <li>By having him, making yourself no less.</li>

  <li class="number">Then dreams, he of another benefice:</li>
  <li>Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,</li>

  <li>Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon</li>
  <li class="number">Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,</li>
  <li>And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two</li>
  <li>And sleeps again. This is that very Mab</li>
  <li>That plats the manes of horses in the night,</li>
  <li>And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,</li>
  <li class="number">Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:</li>
  <li>This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,</li>

  <li>I should have been more strange, I must confess,</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FRIAR LAURENCE</li>
  <li>The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,</li>
  <li>Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,</li>
  <li>And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels</li>
  <li>From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:</li>
  <li class="number">Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,</li>
  <li>The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,</li>
  <li>I must up-fill this osier cage of ours</li>
  <li>With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.</li>
  <li>The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;</li>
  <li class="number">What is her burying grave that is her womb,</li>
  <li>And from her womb children of divers kind</li>
  <li>We sucking on her natural bosom find,</li>
  <li>Many for many virtues excellent,</li>
  <li>None but for some and yet all different.</li>
  <li class="number">O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies</li>
  <li>In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:</li>
  <li>For nought so vile that on the earth doth live</li>
  <li>But to the earth some special good doth give,</li>
  <li>Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use</li>
  <li class="number">Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:</li>
  <li>Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;</li>
  <li>And vice sometimes by action dignified.</li>
  <li>Within the infant rind of this small flower</li>
  <li>Poison hath residence and medicine power:</li>
  <li class="number">For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;</li>
  <li>Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.</li>
  <li>Two such opposed kings encamp them still</li>
  <li>In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;</li>
  <li>And where the worser is predominant,</li>

  <li>What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?</li>
  <li>Young son, it argues a distemper'd head</li>
  <li class="number">So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:</li>
  <li>Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,</li>
  <li>And where care lodges, sleep will never lie;</li>
  <li>But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain</li>
  <li>Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:</li>
  <li class="number">Therefore thy earliness doth me assure</li>
  <li>Thou art up-roused by some distemperature;</li>
  <li>Or if not so, then here I hit it right,</li>
  <li>Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.</li>

  <li>And all combined, save what thou must combine</li>
  <li>By holy marriage: when and where and how</li>
  <li>We met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow,</li>
  <li>I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,</li>

  <li class="speaker">FRIAR LAURENCE</li>
  <li>Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!</li>
  <li>Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,</li>

  <li>Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.</li>
  <li class="number">Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine</li>
  <li>Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!</li>
  <li>How much salt water thrown away in waste,</li>
  <li>To season love, that of it doth not taste!</li>
  <li>The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,</li>
  <li class="number">Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;</li>
  <li>Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit</li>
  <li>Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:</li>
  <li>If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,</li>
  <li>Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:</li>
  <li class="number">And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then,</li>
  <li>Women may fall, when there's no strength in men.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROMEO</li>
  <li>Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.</li>

<ol class="speech">

  <li>For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.</li>

  <li>The other did not so.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FRIAR LAURENCE</li>
  <li class="number">O, she knew well</li>
  <li>Thy love did read by rote and could not spell.</li>
  <li>But come, young waverer, come, go with me,</li>
  <li>In one respect I'll thy assistant be;</li>

<h3>SCENE I.  A public place.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, Page, and Servants</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BENVOLIO</li>
  <li>I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire:</li>
  <li>The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,</li>
  <li>And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl;</li>
  <li>For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MERCUTIO</li>
  <li class="number">Thou art like one of those fellows that when he</li>
  <li>enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword</li>
  <li>upon the table and says 'God send me no need of</li>
  <li>thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws</li>
  <li>it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BENVOLIO</li>
  <li class="number">Am I like such a fellow?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MERCUTIO</li>
  <li>Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as</li>
  <li>any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as</li>
  <li>soon moody to be moved.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BENVOLIO</li>
  <li>And what to?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MERCUTIO</li>
  <li class="number">Nay, an there were two such, we should have none</li>
  <li>shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why,</li>
  <li>thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,</li>
  <li>or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou</li>
  <li>wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no</li>
  <li class="number">other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what</li>
  <li>eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?</li>
  <li>Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of</li>
  <li>meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as</li>
  <li>an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a</li>
  <li class="number">man for coughing in the street, because he hath</li>
  <li>wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:</li>
  <li>didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing</li>
  <li>his new doublet before Easter? with another, for</li>
  <li>tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou</li>
  <li class="number">wilt tutor me from quarrelling!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BENVOLIO</li>
  <li>An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man</li>
  <li>should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MERCUTIO</li>
  <li>The fee-simple! O simple!</li>

  <li>Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an</li>
  <li class="number">thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BENVOLIO</li>
  <li>We talk here in the public haunt of men:</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TYBALT</li>

  <li>Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TYBALT</li>

  <li class="speaker">ROMEO</li>
  <li>I do protest, I never injured thee,</li>

  <li>Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:</li>
  <li>And so, good Capulet —  which name I tender</li>
  <li class="number">As dearly as my own —  be satisfied.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BENVOLIO</li>
  <li>Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;</li>
  <li>Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink</li>
  <li>How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal</li>
  <li>Your high displeasure: all this uttered</li>
  <li class="number">With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,</li>
  <li>Could not take truce with the unruly spleen</li>
  <li>Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts</li>
  <li>With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,</li>
  <li>Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,</li>
  <li class="number">And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats</li>
  <li>Cold death aside, and with the other sends</li>
  <li>It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,</li>
  <li>Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,</li>
  <li>'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than</li>
  <li class="number">his tongue,</li>
  <li>His agile arm beats down their fatal points,</li>
  <li>And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm</li>
  <li>An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life</li>
  <li>Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;</li>
  <li class="number">But by and by comes back to Romeo,</li>
  <li>Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,</li>
  <li>And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I</li>
  <li>Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.</li>
  <li>And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.</li>
  <li class="number">This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LADY CAPULET</li>
  <li>He is a kinsman to the Montague;</li>
  <li>Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:</li>
  <li>Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,</li>
  <li>And all those twenty could but kill one life.</li>
  <li class="number">I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;</li>
  <li>Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE</li>

  <li class="speaker">MONTAGUE</li>
  <li>Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend;</li>
  <li class="number">His fault concludes but what the law should end,</li>
  <li>The life of Tybalt.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE</li>
  <li>And for that offence</li>
  <li>Immediately we do exile him hence:</li>
  <li>I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,</li>
  <li class="number">My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;</li>
  <li>But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine</li>
  <li>That you shall all repent the loss of mine:</li>
  <li>I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;</li>
  <li>Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:</li>
  <li class="number">Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,</li>
  <li>Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.</li>
  <li>Bear hence this body and attend our will:</li>

  <li>My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;</li>

  <li>'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo — banished;'</li>
  <li>That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'</li>
  <li>Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death</li>

  <li>Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,</li>
  <li>Which modern lamentations might have moved?</li>
  <li class="number">But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death,</li>
  <li>'Romeo is banished,' to speak that word,</li>
  <li>Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,</li>
  <li>All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished!'</li>
  <li>There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROMEO</li>
  <li>Ha, banishment! be merciful, say 'death;'</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FRIAR LAURENCE</li>
  <li>Hence from Verona art thou banished:</li>

  <li>Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,</li>

  <li>This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ROMEO</li>
  <li class="number">'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,</li>
  <li>Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog</li>

  <li>But Romeo may not: more validity,</li>
  <li class="number">More honourable state, more courtship lives</li>
  <li>In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seize</li>

  <li>Who even in pure and vestal modesty,</li>
  <li class="number">Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;</li>
  <li>But Romeo may not; he is banished:</li>
  <li>Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:</li>
  <li>They are free men, but I am banished.</li>

  <li>O friar, the damned use that word in hell;</li>
  <li>Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,</li>
  <li class="number">Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LADY CAPULET</li>
  <li>We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:</li>

  <li>Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,</li>

  <li>That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,</li>

  <li>To hear him named, and cannot come to him.</li>

  <li>I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,</li>
  <li class="number">I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,</li>
  <li>It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,</li>

  <li>As that is desperate which we would prevent.</li>
  <li>If, rather than to marry County Paris,</li>

  <li>Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;</li>

  <li>O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,</li>

  <li>Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;</li>

  <li>Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,</li>
  <li>And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.</li>
  <li>Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes</li>
  <li>To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:</li>
  <li class="number">Then, as the manner of our country is,</li>
  <li>In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier</li>
  <li>Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault</li>
  <li>Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.</li>
  <li>In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,</li>
  <li class="number">Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,</li>
  <li>And hither shall he come: and he and I</li>

  <li>Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.</li>
  <li>And this shall free thee from this present shame;</li>

  <li class="speaker">FRIAR LAURENCE</li>
  <li>I will be brief, for my short date of breath</li>
  <li class="number">Is not so long as is a tedious tale.</li>
  <li>Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;</li>
  <li>And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:</li>
  <li>I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day</li>
  <li>Was Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death</li>
  <li class="number">Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city,</li>
  <li>For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.</li>
  <li>You, to remove that siege of grief from her,</li>
  <li>Betroth'd and would have married her perforce</li>
  <li>To County Paris: then comes she to me,</li>
  <li class="number">And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean</li>
  <li>To rid her from this second marriage,</li>
  <li>Or in my cell there would she kill herself.</li>
  <li>Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,</li>
  <li>A sleeping potion; which so took effect</li>
  <li class="number">As I intended, for it wrought on her</li>
  <li>The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,</li>
  <li>That he should hither come as this dire night,</li>
  <li>To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,</li>
  <li>Being the time the potion's force should cease.</li>
  <li class="number">But he which bore my letter, Friar John,</li>
  <li>Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight</li>
  <li>Return'd my letter back. Then all alone</li>
  <li>At the prefixed hour of her waking,</li>
  <li>Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;</li>
  <li class="number">Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,</li>
  <li>Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:</li>
  <li>But when I came, some minute ere the time</li>
  <li>Of her awaking, here untimely lay</li>
  <li>The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.</li>
  <li class="number">She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,</li>
  <li>And bear this work of heaven with patience:</li>
  <li>But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;</li>
  <li>And she, too desperate, would not go with me,</li>
  <li>But, as it seems, did violence on herself.</li>
  <li class="number">All this I know; and to the marriage</li>
  <li>Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this</li>
  <li>Miscarried by my fault, let my old life</li>
  <li>Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,</li>
  <li>Unto the rigour of severest law.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BALTHASAR</li>
  <li>I brought my master news of Juliet's death;</li>
  <li>And then in post he came from Mantua</li>
  <li>To this same place, to this same monument.</li>
  <li class="number">This letter he early bid me give his father,</li>
  <li>And threatened me with death, going in the vault,</li>
  <li>I departed not and left him there.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE</li>
  <li>Give me the letter; I will look on it.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PAGE</li>
  <li>He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;</li>
  <li>And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:</li>
  <li>Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;</li>
  <li>And by and by my master drew on him;</li>
  <li class="number">And then I ran away to call the watch.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE</li>
  <li>This letter doth make good the friar's words,</li>
  <li>Their course of love, the tidings of her death:</li>
  <li>And here he writes that he did buy a poison</li>
  <li>Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal</li>
  <li class="number">Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.</li>
  <li>Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!</li>
  <li>See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,</li>
  <li>That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.</li>
  <li>And I for winking at your discords too</li>
  <li class="number">Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAPULET</li>
  <li>O brother Montague, give me thy hand:</li>
  <li>This is my daughter's jointure, for no more</li>
  <li>Can I demand.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MONTAGUE</li>
  <li>But I can give thee more:</li>
  <li class="number">For I will raise her statue in pure gold;</li>
  <li>That while Verona by that name is known,</li>
  <li>There shall no figure at such rate be set</li>
  <li>As that of true and faithful Juliet.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAPULET</li>
  <li>As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;</li>
  <li class="number">Poor sacrifices of our enmity!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE</li>
  <li>A glooming peace this morning with it brings;</li>
  <li>The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:</li>
  <li>Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;</li>
  <li>Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:</li>
  <li class="number">For never was a story of more woe</li>
  <li>Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.</li>
