<h3>SCENE I.  King Lear's palace.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter KENT, GLOUCESTER, and EDMUND</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KENT</li>
  <li>I thought the king had more affected the Duke of</li>
  <li>Albany than Cornwall.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>It did always seem so to us: but now, in the</li>
  <li>division of the kingdom, it appears not which of</li>
  <li class="number">the dukes he values most; for equalities are so</li>
  <li>weighed, that curiosity in neither can make choice</li>
  <li>of either's moiety.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KENT</li>
  <li>Is not this your son, my lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge: I have</li>
  <li class="number">so often blushed to acknowledge him, that now I am</li>
  <li>brazed to it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KENT</li>
  <li>I cannot conceive you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>Sir, this young fellow's mother could: whereupon</li>
  <li>she grew round-wombed, and had, indeed, sir, a son</li>
  <li class="number">for her cradle ere she had a husband for her bed.</li>
  <li>Do you smell a fault?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KENT</li>
  <li>I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it</li>
  <li>being so proper.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>But I have, sir, a son by order of law, some year</li>
  <li class="number">elder than this, who yet is no dearer in my account:</li>
  <li>though this knave came something saucily into the</li>
  <li>world before he was sent for, yet was his mother</li>
  <li>fair; there was good sport at his making, and the</li>
  <li>whoreson must be acknowledged. Do you know this</li>
  <li class="number">noble gentleman, Edmund?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EDMUND</li>
  <li>No, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>My lord of Kent: remember him hereafter as my</li>
  <li>honourable friend.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EDMUND</li>
  <li>My services to your lordship.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KENT</li>
  <li class="number">I must love you, and sue to know you better.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EDMUND</li>
  <li>Sir, I shall study deserving.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>He hath been out nine years, and away he shall</li>
  <li>again. The king is coming.</li>

GONERIL, REGAN, CORDELIA, and Attendants</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING LEAR</li>
  <li>Attend the lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li class="number">I shall, my liege.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt GLOUCESTER and EDMUND</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING LEAR</li>
  <li>Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.</li>
  <li>Give me the map there. Know that we have divided</li>
  <li>In three our kingdom: and 'tis our fast intent</li>
  <li>To shake all cares and business from our age;</li>
  <li class="number">Conferring them on younger strengths, while we</li>
  <li>Unburthen'd crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,</li>
  <li>And you, our no less loving son of Albany,</li>
  <li>We have this hour a constant will to publish</li>
  <li>Our daughters' several dowers, that future strife</li>
  <li class="number">May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,</li>
  <li>Great rivals in our youngest daughter's love,</li>
  <li>Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,</li>
  <li>And here are to be answer'd. Tell me, my daughters —  </li>
  <li>Since now we will divest us both of rule,</li>
  <li class="number">Interest of territory, cares of state —  </li>
  <li>Which of you shall we say doth love us most?</li>
  <li>That we our largest bounty may extend</li>
  <li>Where nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril,</li>
  <li>Our eldest-born, speak first.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GONERIL</li>
  <li class="number">Sir, I love you more than words can wield the matter;</li>
  <li>Dearer than eye-sight, space, and liberty;</li>
  <li>Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare;</li>
  <li>No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;</li>
  <li>As much as child e'er loved, or father found;</li>
  <li class="number">A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable;</li>
  <li>Beyond all manner of so much I love you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CORDELIA</li>
  <li>Aside  What shall Cordelia do?</li>
  <li>Love, and be silent.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LEAR</li>
  <li>Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,</li>
  <li class="number">With shadowy forests and with champains rich'd,</li>
  <li>With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,</li>
  <li>We make thee lady: to thine and Albany's issue</li>
  <li>Be this perpetual. What says our second daughter,</li>
  <li>Our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwall? Speak.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">REGAN</li>
  <li class="number">Sir, I am made</li>
  <li>Of the self-same metal that my sister is,</li>
  <li>And prize me at her worth. In my true heart</li>
  <li>I find she names my very deed of love;</li>
  <li>Only she comes too short: that I profess</li>
  <li class="number">Myself an enemy to all other joys,</li>
  <li>Which the most precious square of sense possesses;</li>
  <li>And find I am alone felicitate</li>
  <li>In your dear highness' love.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CORDELIA</li>
  <li>Aside Then poor Cordelia!</li>
  <li class="number">And yet not so; since, I am sure, my love's</li>
  <li>More richer than my tongue.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING LEAR</li>
  <li>To thee and thine hereditary ever</li>
  <li>Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom;</li>
  <li>No less in space, validity, and pleasure,</li>
  <li class="number">Than that conferr'd on Goneril. Now, our joy,</li>
  <li>Although the last, not least; to whose young love</li>
  <li>The vines of France and milk of Burgundy</li>
  <li>Strive to be interess'd; what can you say to draw</li>
  <li>A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CORDELIA</li>
  <li class="number">Nothing, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING LEAR</li>
  <li>Nothing!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CORDELIA</li>
  <li>Nothing.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING LEAR</li>
  <li>Nothing will come of nothing: speak again.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CORDELIA</li>
  <li>Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave</li>
  <li class="number">My heart into my mouth: I love your majesty</li>
  <li>According to my bond; nor more nor less.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING LEAR</li>
  <li>How, how, Cordelia! mend your speech a little,</li>
  <li>Lest it may mar your fortunes.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CORDELIA</li>
  <li>Good my lord,</li>
  <li class="number">You have begot me, bred me, loved me: I</li>
  <li>Return those duties back as are right fit,</li>
  <li>Obey you, love you, and most honour you.</li>
  <li>Why have my sisters husbands, if they say</li>
  <li>They love you all? Haply, when I shall wed,</li>
  <li class="number">That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry</li>
  <li>Half my love with him, half my care and duty:</li>
  <li>Sure, I shall never marry like my sisters,</li>
  <li>To love my father all.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING LEAR</li>
  <li>But goes thy heart with this?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CORDELIA</li>
  <li class="number">Ay, good my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING LEAR</li>
  <li>So young, and so untender?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CORDELIA</li>
  <li>So young, my lord, and true.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING LEAR</li>
  <li>Let it be so; thy truth, then, be thy dower:</li>
  <li>For, by the sacred radiance of the sun,</li>
  <li class="number">The mysteries of Hecate, and the night;</li>
  <li>By all the operation of the orbs</li>
  <li>From whom we do exist, and cease to be;</li>
  <li>Here I disclaim all my paternal care,</li>
  <li>Propinquity and property of blood,</li>
  <li class="number">And as a stranger to my heart and me</li>
  <li>Hold thee, from this, for ever. The barbarous Scythian,</li>
  <li>Or he that makes his generation messes</li>
  <li>To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom</li>
  <li>Be as well neighbour'd, pitied, and relieved,</li>
  <li class="number">As thou my sometime daughter.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KENT</li>
  <li>Good my liege —  </li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING LEAR</li>
  <li>Peace, Kent!</li>
  <li>Come not between the dragon and his wrath.</li>
  <li>I loved her most, and thought to set my rest</li>
  <li class="number">On her kind nursery. Hence, and avoid my sight!</li>
  <li>So be my grave my peace, as here I give</li>
  <li>Her father's heart from her! Call France; who stirs?</li>
  <li>Call Burgundy. Cornwall and Albany,</li>
  <li>With my two daughters' dowers digest this third:</li>
  <li class="number">Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.</li>
  <li>I do invest you jointly with my power,</li>
  <li>Pre-eminence, and all the large effects</li>
  <li>That troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course,</li>
  <li>With reservation of an hundred knights,</li>
  <li class="number">By you to be sustain'd, shall our abode</li>
  <li>Make with you by due turns. Only we still retain</li>
  <li>The name, and all the additions to a king;</li>
  <li>The sway, revenue, execution of the rest,</li>
  <li>Beloved sons, be yours: which to confirm,</li>
  <li class="number">This coronet part betwixt you.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Giving the crown</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KENT</li>
  <li>Royal Lear,</li>
  <li>Whom I have ever honour'd as my king,</li>
  <li>Loved as my father, as my master follow'd,</li>
  <li>As my great patron thought on in my prayers —  </li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING LEAR</li>
  <li class="number">The bow is bent and drawn, make from the shaft.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KENT</li>
  <li>Let it fall rather, though the fork invade</li>
  <li>The region of my heart: be Kent unmannerly,</li>
  <li>When Lear is mad. What wilt thou do, old man?</li>
  <li>Think'st thou that duty shall have dread to speak,</li>
  <li class="number">When power to flattery bows? To plainness honour's bound,</li>
  <li>When majesty stoops to folly. Reverse thy doom;</li>
  <li>And, in thy best consideration, cheque</li>
  <li>This hideous rashness: answer my life my judgment,</li>
  <li>Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least;</li>
  <li class="number">Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound</li>
  <li>Reverbs no hollowness.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING LEAR</li>
  <li>Kent, on thy life, no more.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KENT</li>
  <li>My life I never held but as a pawn</li>
  <li>To wage against thy enemies; nor fear to lose it,</li>
  <li class="number">Thy safety being the motive.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING LEAR</li>
  <li>Out of my sight!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KENT</li>
  <li>See better, Lear; and let me still remain</li>
  <li>The true blank of thine eye.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING LEAR</li>
  <li>Now, by Apollo —  </li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KENT</li>
  <li class="number">Now, by Apollo, king,</li>

  <li class="speaker">KING LEAR</li>
  <li>O, vassal! miscreant!</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Laying his hand on his sword</div>

  <li>Dear sir, forbear.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KENT</li>
  <li>Do:</li>
  <li class="number">Kill thy physician, and the fee bestow</li>
  <li>Upon thy foul disease. Revoke thy doom;</li>
  <li>Or, whilst I can vent clamour from my throat,</li>
  <li>I'll tell thee thou dost evil.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING LEAR</li>
  <li>Hear me, recreant!</li>
  <li class="number">On thine allegiance, hear me!</li>
  <li>Since thou hast sought to make us break our vow,</li>
  <li>Which we durst never yet, and with strain'd pride</li>
  <li>To come between our sentence and our power,</li>
  <li>Which nor our nature nor our place can bear,</li>
  <li class="number">Our potency made good, take thy reward.</li>
  <li>Five days we do allot thee, for provision</li>
  <li>To shield thee from diseases of the world;</li>
  <li>And on the sixth to turn thy hated back</li>
  <li>Upon our kingdom: if, on the tenth day following,</li>
  <li class="number">Thy banish'd trunk be found in our dominions,</li>
  <li>The moment is thy death. Away! by Jupiter,</li>
  <li>This shall not be revoked.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KENT</li>
  <li>Fare thee well, king: sith thus thou wilt appear,</li>

  <li class="stage-direction">To CORDELIA</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Flourish. Re-enter GLOUCESTER, with KING OF FRANCE,
BURGUNDY, and Attendants</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>Here's France and Burgundy, my noble lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING LEAR</li>
  <li>My lord of Burgundy.</li>
  <li>We first address towards you, who with this king</li>
  <li>Hath rivall'd for our daughter: what, in the least,</li>
  <li class="number">Will you require in present dower with her,</li>
  <li>Or cease your quest of love?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BURGUNDY</li>
  <li>Most royal majesty,</li>
  <li>I crave no more than what your highness offer'd,</li>
  <li>Nor will you tender less.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING LEAR</li>
  <li class="number">Right noble Burgundy,</li>
  <li>When she was dear to us, we did hold her so;</li>
  <li>But now her price is fall'n. Sir, there she stands:</li>
  <li>If aught within that little seeming substance,</li>
  <li>Or all of it, with our displeasure pieced,</li>
  <li class="number">And nothing more, may fitly like your grace,</li>
  <li>She's there, and she is yours.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BURGUNDY</li>
  <li>I know no answer.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING LEAR</li>
  <li>Will you, with those infirmities she owes,</li>
  <li>Unfriended, new-adopted to our hate,</li>
  <li class="number">Dower'd with our curse, and stranger'd with our oath,</li>
  <li>Take her, or leave her?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BURGUNDY</li>
  <li>Pardon me, royal sir;</li>
  <li>Election makes not up on such conditions.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING LEAR</li>
  <li>Then leave her, sir; for, by the power that made me,</li>
  <li class="number">I tell you all her wealth.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">To KING OF FRANCE</li>
  <li>For you, great king,</li>
  <li>I would not from your love make such a stray,</li>
  <li>To match you where I hate; therefore beseech you</li>
  <li>To avert your liking a more worthier way</li>
  <li class="number">Than on a wretch whom nature is ashamed</li>
  <li>Almost to acknowledge hers.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING OF FRANCE</li>
  <li>This is most strange,</li>
  <li>That she, that even but now was your best object,</li>
  <li>The argument of your praise, balm of your age,</li>
  <li class="number">Most best, most dearest, should in this trice of time</li>
  <li>Commit a thing so monstrous, to dismantle</li>
  <li>So many folds of favour. Sure, her offence</li>
  <li>Must be of such unnatural degree,</li>
  <li>That monsters it, or your fore-vouch'd affection</li>
  <li class="number">Fall'n into taint: which to believe of her,</li>
  <li>Must be a faith that reason without miracle</li>
  <li>Could never plant in me.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CORDELIA</li>
  <li>I yet beseech your majesty —  </li>
  <li>If for I want that glib and oily art,</li>
  <li class="number">To speak and purpose not; since what I well intend,</li>
  <li>I'll do't before I speak —  that you make known</li>
  <li>It is no vicious blot, murder, or foulness,</li>
  <li>No unchaste action, or dishonour'd step,</li>
  <li>That hath deprived me of your grace and favour;</li>
  <li class="number">But even for want of that for which I am richer,</li>
  <li>A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue</li>
  <li>As I am glad I have not, though not to have it</li>
  <li>Hath lost me in your liking.</li>

  <li class="speaker">KING OF FRANCE</li>
  <li>Is it but this —  a tardiness in nature</li>

  <li>What say you to the lady? Love's not love</li>
  <li class="number">When it is mingled with regards that stand</li>

  <li>Be it lawful I take up what's cast away.</li>
  <li>Gods, gods! 'tis strange that from their cold'st neglect</li>

  <li>Thy dowerless daughter, king, thrown to my chance,</li>
  <li class="number">Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France:</li>
  <li>Not all the dukes of waterish Burgundy</li>
  <li>Can buy this unprized precious maid of me.</li>
  <li>Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind:</li>
  <li>Thou losest here, a better where to find.</li>

  <li>child. We have seen the best of our time:</li>

  <li>Regan, I think you are; I know what reason</li>
  <li>I have to think so: if thou shouldst not be glad,</li>
  <li>I would divorce me from thy mother's tomb,</li>
  <li>Sepulchring an adultress.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">To KENT</li>
  <li class="number">O, are you free?</li>
  <li>Some other time for that. Beloved Regan,</li>
  <li>Thy sister's naught: O Regan, she hath tied</li>
  <li>Sharp-tooth'd unkindness, like a vulture, here:</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Points to his heart</li>

  <li>O, sir, you are old.</li>

  <li>No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse:</li>

  <li>Which the impetuous blasts, with eyeless rage,</li>
  <li>Catch in their fury, and make nothing of;</li>
  <li class="number">Strives in his little world of man to out-scorn</li>

  <li>Who have — as who have not, that their great stars</li>
  <li class="number">Throned and set high? — servants, who seem no less,</li>
  <li>Which are to France the spies and speculations</li>
  <li>Intelligent of our state; what hath been seen,</li>
  <li>Either in snuffs and packings of the dukes,</li>
  <li>Or the hard rein which both of them have borne</li>
  <li class="number">Against the old kind king; or something deeper,</li>
  <li>Whereof perchance these are but furnishings;</li>
  <li>But, true it is, from France there comes a power</li>
  <li>Into this scatter'd kingdom; who already,</li>
  <li>Wise in our negligence, have secret feet</li>
  <li class="number">In some of our best ports, and are at point</li>
  <li>To show their open banner. Now to you:</li>
  <li>If on my credit you dare build so far</li>

  <li>Some that will thank you, making just report</li>
  <li class="number">Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow</li>

  <li>My lady charged my duty in this business.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">REGAN</li>
  <li>Why should she write to Edmund? Might not you</li>
  <li>Transport her purposes by word? Belike,</li>
  <li>Something — I know not what: I'll love thee much,</li>
  <li class="number">Let me unseal the letter.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OSWALD</li>
  <li>Madam, I had rather — </li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">REGAN</li>
  <li>I know your lady does not love her husband;</li>
  <li>I am sure of that: and at her late being here</li>
  <li>She gave strange oeillades and most speaking looks</li>
  <li class="number">To noble Edmund. I know you are of her bosom.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OSWALD</li>
  <li>I, madam?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">REGAN</li>
  <li>I speak in understanding; you are; I know't:</li>
  <li>Therefore I do advise you, take this note:</li>
  <li>My lord is dead; Edmund and I have talk'd;</li>
  <li class="number">And more convenient is he for my hand</li>
  <li>Than for your lady's: you may gather more.</li>
  <li>If you do find him, pray you, give him this;</li>
  <li>And when your mistress hears thus much from you,</li>
  <li>I pray, desire her call her wisdom to her.</li>
  <li class="number">So, fare you well.</li>
  <li>If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor,</li>
  <li>Preferment falls on him that cuts him off.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">OSWALD</li>
  <li>Would I could meet him, madam! I should show</li>
  <li>What party I do follow.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">

  <li class="number">Fare thee well.</li>

<h3>SCENE VI.  Fields near Dover.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter GLOUCESTER, and EDGAR dressed like a peasant</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>When shall we come to the top of that same hill?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EDGAR</li>
  <li>You do climb up it now: look, how we labour.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>Methinks the ground is even.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EDGAR</li>
  <li>Horrible steep.</li>
  <li class="number">Hark, do you hear the sea?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>No, truly.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EDGAR</li>
  <li>Why, then, your other senses grow imperfect</li>
  <li>By your eyes' anguish.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>So may it be, indeed:</li>
  <li class="number">Methinks thy voice is alter'd; and thou speak'st</li>
  <li>In better phrase and matter than thou didst.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EDGAR</li>
  <li>You're much deceived: in nothing am I changed</li>
  <li>But in my garments.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>Methinks you're better spoken.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EDGAR</li>
  <li class="number">Come on, sir; here's the place: stand still. How fearful</li>
  <li>And dizzy 'tis, to cast one's eyes so low!</li>
  <li>The crows and choughs that wing the midway air</li>
  <li>Show scarce so gross as beetles: half way down</li>
  <li>Hangs one that gathers samphire, dreadful trade!</li>
  <li class="number">Methinks he seems no bigger than his head:</li>
  <li>The fishermen, that walk upon the beach,</li>
  <li>Appear like mice; and yond tall anchoring bark,</li>
  <li>Diminish'd to her cock; her cock, a buoy</li>
  <li>Almost too small for sight: the murmuring surge,</li>
  <li class="number">That on the unnumber'd idle pebbles chafes,</li>
  <li>Cannot be heard so high. I'll look no more;</li>
  <li>Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sight</li>
  <li>Topple down headlong.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>Set me where you stand.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EDGAR</li>
  <li class="number">Give me your hand: you are now within a foot</li>
  <li>Of the extreme verge: for all beneath the moon</li>
  <li>Would I not leap upright.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>Let go my hand.</li>
  <li>Here, friend, 's another purse; in it a jewel</li>
  <li class="number">Well worth a poor man's taking: fairies and gods</li>
  <li>Prosper it with thee! Go thou farther off;</li>
  <li>Bid me farewell, and let me hear thee going.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EDGAR</li>
  <li>Now fare you well, good sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>With all my heart.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EDGAR</li>
  <li class="number">Why I do trifle thus with his despair</li>
  <li>Is done to cure it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>Kneeling  O you mighty gods!</li>
  <li>This world I do renounce, and, in your sights,</li>
  <li>Shake patiently my great affliction off:</li>
  <li class="number">If I could bear it longer, and not fall</li>
  <li>To quarrel with your great opposeless wills,</li>
  <li>My snuff and loathed part of nature should</li>
  <li>Burn itself out. If Edgar live, O, bless him!</li>
  <li>Now, fellow, fare thee well.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">He falls forward</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EDGAR</li>
  <li class="number">Gone, sir: farewell.</li>
  <li>And yet I know not how conceit may rob</li>
  <li>The treasury of life, when life itself</li>
  <li>Yields to the theft: had he been where he thought,</li>
  <li>By this, had thought been past. Alive or dead?</li>
  <li class="number">Ho, you sir! friend! Hear you, sir! speak!</li>
  <li>Thus might he pass indeed: yet he revives.</li>
  <li>What are you, sir?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>Away, and let me die.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EDGAR</li>
  <li>Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,</li>
  <li class="number">So many fathom down precipitating,</li>
  <li>Thou'dst shiver'd like an egg: but thou dost breathe;</li>
  <li>Hast heavy substance; bleed'st not; speak'st; art sound.</li>
  <li>Ten masts at each make not the altitude</li>
  <li>Which thou hast perpendicularly fell:</li>
  <li class="number">Thy life's a miracle. Speak yet again.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>But have I fall'n, or no?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EDGAR</li>
  <li>From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.</li>
  <li>Look up a-height; the shrill-gorged lark so far</li>
  <li>Cannot be seen or heard: do but look up.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li class="number">Alack, I have no eyes.</li>
  <li>Is wretchedness deprived that benefit,</li>
  <li>To end itself by death? 'Twas yet some comfort,</li>
  <li>When misery could beguile the tyrant's rage,</li>
  <li>And frustrate his proud will.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EDGAR</li>
  <li class="number">Give me your arm:</li>
  <li>Up: so. How is 't? Feel you your legs? You stand.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>Too well, too well.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EDGAR</li>
  <li>This is above all strangeness.</li>
  <li>Upon the crown o' the cliff, what thing was that</li>
  <li class="number">Which parted from you?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>A poor unfortunate beggar.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EDGAR</li>
  <li>As I stood here below, methought his eyes</li>
  <li>Were two full moons; he had a thousand noses,</li>
  <li>Horns whelk'd and waved like the enridged sea:</li>
  <li class="number">It was some fiend; therefore, thou happy father,</li>
  <li>Think that the clearest gods, who make them honours</li>
  <li>Of men's impossibilities, have preserved thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>I do remember now: henceforth I'll bear</li>
  <li>Affliction till it do cry out itself</li>
  <li class="number">'Enough, enough,' and die. That thing you speak of,</li>
  <li>I took it for a man; often 'twould say</li>
  <li>'The fiend, the fiend:' he led me to that place.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EDGAR</li>
  <li>Bear free and patient thoughts. But who comes here?</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Enter KING LEAR, fantastically dressed with wild flowers</li>
  <li>The safer sense will ne'er accommodate</li>
  <li class="number">His master thus.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING LEAR</li>
  <li>No, they cannot touch me for coining; I am the</li>
  <li>king himself.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EDGAR</li>
  <li>O thou side-piercing sight!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING LEAR</li>
  <li>Nature's above art in that respect. There's your</li>
  <li class="number">press-money. That fellow handles his bow like a</li>
  <li>crow-keeper: draw me a clothier's yard. Look,</li>
  <li>look, a mouse! Peace, peace; this piece of toasted</li>
  <li>cheese will do 't. There's my gauntlet; I'll prove</li>
  <li>it on a giant. Bring up the brown bills. O, well</li>
  <li class="number">flown, bird! i' the clout, i' the clout: hewgh!</li>
  <li>Give the word.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EDGAR</li>
  <li>Sweet marjoram.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING LEAR</li>
  <li>Pass.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>I know that voice.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING LEAR</li>
  <li class="number">Ha! Goneril, with a white beard! They flattered</li>
  <li>me like a dog; and told me I had white hairs in my</li>
  <li>beard ere the black ones were there. To say 'ay'</li>
  <li>and 'no' to every thing that I said! — 'Ay' and 'no'</li>
  <li>too was no good divinity. When the rain came to</li>
  <li class="number">wet me once, and the wind to make me chatter; when</li>
  <li>the thunder would not peace at my bidding; there I</li>
  <li>found 'em, there I smelt 'em out. Go to, they are</li>
  <li>not men o' their words: they told me I was every</li>
  <li>thing; 'tis a lie, I am not ague-proof.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li class="number">The trick of that voice I do well remember:</li>
  <li>Is 't not the king?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING LEAR</li>
  <li>Ay, every inch a king:</li>
  <li>When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.</li>
  <li>I pardon that man's life. What was thy cause? Adultery?</li>
  <li class="number">Thou shalt not die: die for adultery! No:</li>
  <li>The wren goes to 't, and the small gilded fly</li>
  <li>Does lecher in my sight.</li>
  <li>Let copulation thrive; for Gloucester's bastard son</li>
  <li>Was kinder to his father than my daughters</li>
  <li class="number">Got 'tween the lawful sheets.</li>
  <li>To 't, luxury, pell-mell! for I lack soldiers.</li>
  <li>Behold yond simpering dame,</li>
  <li>Whose face between her forks presages snow;</li>
  <li>That minces virtue, and does shake the head</li>
  <li class="number">To hear of pleasure's name;</li>
  <li>The fitchew, nor the soiled horse, goes to 't</li>
  <li>With a more riotous appetite.</li>
  <li>Down from the waist they are Centaurs,</li>
  <li>Though women all above:</li>
  <li class="number">But to the girdle do the gods inherit,</li>
  <li>Beneath is all the fiends';</li>
  <li>There's hell, there's darkness, there's the</li>
  <li>sulphurous pit,</li>
  <li>Burning, scalding, stench, consumption; fie,</li>
  <li class="number">fie, fie! pah, pah! Give me an ounce of civet,</li>
  <li>good apothecary, to sweeten my imagination:</li>
  <li>there's money for thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>O, let me kiss that hand!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING LEAR</li>
  <li>Let me wipe it first; it smells of mortality.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li class="number">O ruin'd piece of nature! This great world</li>
  <li>Shall so wear out to nought. Dost thou know me?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING LEAR</li>
  <li>I remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou squiny</li>
  <li>at me? No, do thy worst, blind Cupid! I'll not</li>
  <li>love. Read thou this challenge; mark but the</li>
  <li class="number">penning of it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>Were all the letters suns, I could not see one.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EDGAR</li>
  <li>I would not take this from report; it is,</li>
  <li>And my heart breaks at it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING LEAR</li>
  <li>Read.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li class="number">What, with the case of eyes?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING LEAR</li>
  <li>O, ho, are you there with me? No eyes in your</li>
  <li>head, nor no money in your purse? Your eyes are in</li>
  <li>a heavy case, your purse in a light; yet you see how</li>
  <li>this world goes.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li class="number">I see it feelingly.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING LEAR</li>
  <li>What, art mad? A man may see how this world goes</li>
  <li>with no eyes. Look with thine ears: see how yond</li>
  <li>justice rails upon yond simple thief. Hark, in</li>
  <li>thine ear: change places; and, handy-dandy, which</li>
  <li class="number">is the justice, which is the thief? Thou hast seen</li>
  <li>a farmer's dog bark at a beggar?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>Ay, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING LEAR</li>
  <li>And the creature run from the cur? There thou</li>
  <li>mightst behold the great image of authority: a</li>
  <li class="number">dog's obeyed in office.</li>
  <li>Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!</li>
  <li>Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back;</li>
  <li>Thou hotly lust'st to use her in that kind</li>
  <li>For which thou whipp'st her. The usurer hangs the cozener.</li>
  <li class="number">Through tatter'd clothes small vices do appear;</li>
  <li>Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,</li>
  <li>And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks:</li>
  <li>Arm it in rags, a pigmy's straw does pierce it.</li>
  <li>None does offend, none, I say, none; I'll able 'em:</li>
  <li class="number">Take that of me, my friend, who have the power</li>
  <li>To seal the accuser's lips. Get thee glass eyes;</li>
  <li>And like a scurvy politician, seem</li>
  <li>To see the things thou dost not. Now, now, now, now:</li>
  <li>Pull off my boots: harder, harder: so.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EDGAR</li>
  <li class="number">O, matter and impertinency mix'd! Reason in madness!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING LEAR</li>
  <li>If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes.</li>
  <li>I know thee well enough; thy name is Gloucester:</li>
  <li>Thou must be patient; we came crying hither:</li>
  <li>Thou know'st, the first time that we smell the air,</li>
  <li class="number">We wawl and cry. I will preach to thee: mark.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>Alack, alack the day!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING LEAR</li>
  <li>When we are born, we cry that we are come</li>
  <li>To this great stage of fools: this a good block;</li>
  <li>It were a delicate stratagem, to shoe</li>
  <li class="number">A troop of horse with felt: I'll put 't in proof;</li>
  <li>And when I have stol'n upon these sons-in-law,</li>
  <li>Then, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KENT</li>
  <li class="number">Kneeling  O my good master!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING LEAR</li>
  <li>Prithee, away.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EDGAR</li>
  <li>'Tis noble Kent, your friend.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING LEAR</li>
  <li>A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!</li>
  <li>I might have saved her; now she's gone for ever!</li>
  <li class="number">Cordelia, Cordelia! stay a little. Ha!</li>
  <li>What is't thou say'st? Her voice was ever soft,</li>
  <li>Gentle, and low, an excellent thing in woman.</li>
  <li>I kill'd the slave that was a-hanging thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Captain</li>
  <li>'Tis true, my lords, he did.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING LEAR</li>
  <li class="number">Did I not, fellow?</li>
  <li>I have seen the day, with my good biting falchion</li>
  <li>I would have made them skip: I am old now,</li>
  <li>And these same crosses spoil me. Who are you?</li>
  <li>Mine eyes are not o' the best: I'll tell you straight.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KENT</li>
  <li class="number">If fortune brag of two she loved and hated,</li>
  <li>One of them we behold.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING LEAR</li>
  <li>This is a dull sight. Are you not Kent?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KENT</li>
  <li>The same,</li>
  <li>Your servant Kent: Where is your servant Caius?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING LEAR</li>
  <li class="number">He's a good fellow, I can tell you that;</li>
  <li>He'll strike, and quickly too: he's dead and rotten.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KENT</li>
  <li>No, my good lord; I am the very man —  </li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING LEAR</li>
  <li>I'll see that straight.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KENT</li>
  <li>That, from your first of difference and decay,</li>
  <li class="number">Have follow'd your sad steps.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING LEAR</li>
  <li>You are welcome hither.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KENT</li>
  <li>Nor no man else: all's cheerless, dark, and deadly.</li>
  <li>Your eldest daughters have fordone them selves,</li>
  <li>And desperately are dead.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING LEAR</li>
  <li class="number">Ay, so I think.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ALBANY</li>
  <li>He knows not what he says: and vain it is</li>
  <li>That we present us to him.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EDGAR</li>
  <li>Very bootless.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter a Captain</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Captain</li>
  <li>Edmund is dead, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ALBANY</li>
  <li class="number">That's but a trifle here.</li>
  <li>You lords and noble friends, know our intent.</li>
  <li>What comfort to this great decay may come</li>
  <li>Shall be applied: for us we will resign,</li>
  <li>During the life of this old majesty,</li>
  <li class="number">To him our absolute power:</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">To EDGAR and KENT</li>
  <li>you, to your rights:</li>
  <li>With boot, and such addition as your honours</li>
  <li>Have more than merited. All friends shall taste</li>
  <li>The wages of their virtue, and all foes</li>
  <li class="number">The cup of their deservings. O, see, see!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING LEAR</li>
  <li>And my poor fool is hang'd! No, no, no life!</li>
  <li>Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life,</li>
  <li>And thou no breath at all? Thou'lt come no more,</li>
  <li>Never, never, never, never, never!</li>
  <li class="number">Pray you, undo this button: thank you, sir.</li>
  <li>Do you see this? Look on her, look, her lips,</li>
  <li>Look there, look there!</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Dies</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EDGAR</li>
  <li>He faints! My lord, my lord!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KENT</li>
  <li>Break, heart; I prithee, break!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EDGAR</li>
  <li class="number">Look up, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KENT</li>
  <li>Vex not his ghost: O, let him pass! he hates him much</li>
  <li>That would upon the rack of this tough world</li>
  <li>Stretch him out longer.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EDGAR</li>
  <li>He is gone, indeed.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KENT</li>
  <li class="number">The wonder is, he hath endured so long:</li>
  <li>He but usurp'd his life.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ALBANY</li>
  <li>Bear them from hence. Our present business</li>
  <li>Is general woe.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">To KENT and EDGAR</li>
  <li>Friends of my soul, you twain</li>
  <li class="number">Rule in this realm, and the gored state sustain.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KENT</li>
  <li>I have a journey, sir, shortly to go;</li>
  <li>My master calls me, I must not say no.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ALBANY</li>
  <li>The weight of this sad time we must obey;</li>
  <li>Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.</li>
  <li class="number">The oldest hath borne most: we that are young</li>
  <li>Shall never see so much, nor live so long.</li>
