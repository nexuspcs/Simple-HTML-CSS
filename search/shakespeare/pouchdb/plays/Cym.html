<h3>SCENE I.  Britain. The garden of Cymbeline's palace.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter two Gentlemen</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Gentleman</li>
  <li>You do not meet a man but frowns: our bloods</li>
  <li>No more obey the heavens than our courtiers</li>
  <li>Still seem as does the king.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Gentleman</li>
  <li>But what's the matter?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Gentleman</li>
  <li class="number">His daughter, and the heir of's kingdom, whom</li>
  <li>He purposed to his wife's sole son — a widow</li>
  <li>That late he married — hath referr'd herself</li>
  <li>Unto a poor but worthy gentleman: she's wedded;</li>
  <li>Her husband banish'd; she imprison'd: all</li>
  <li class="number">Is outward sorrow; though I think the king</li>
  <li>Be touch'd at very heart.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Gentleman</li>
  <li>None but the king?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Gentleman</li>
  <li>He that hath lost her too; so is the queen,</li>
  <li>That most desired the match; but not a courtier,</li>
  <li class="number">Although they wear their faces to the bent</li>
  <li>Of the king's look's, hath a heart that is not</li>
  <li>Glad at the thing they scowl at.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Gentleman</li>
  <li>And why so?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Gentleman</li>
  <li>He that hath miss'd the princess is a thing</li>
  <li class="number">Too bad for bad report: and he that hath her — </li>
  <li>I mean, that married her, alack, good man!</li>
  <li>And therefore banish'd — is a creature such</li>
  <li>As, to seek through the regions of the earth</li>
  <li>For one his like, there would be something failing</li>
  <li class="number">In him that should compare. I do not think</li>
  <li>So fair an outward and such stuff within</li>
  <li>Endows a man but he.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Gentleman</li>
  <li>You speak him far.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Gentleman</li>
  <li>I do extend him, sir, within himself,</li>
  <li class="number">Crush him together rather than unfold</li>
  <li>His measure duly.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Gentleman</li>
  <li>What's his name and birth?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Gentleman</li>
  <li>I cannot delve him to the root: his father</li>
  <li>Was call'd Sicilius, who did join his honour</li>
  <li class="number">Against the Romans with Cassibelan,</li>
  <li>But had his titles by Tenantius whom</li>
  <li>He served with glory and admired success,</li>
  <li>So gain'd the sur-addition Leonatus;</li>
  <li>And had, besides this gentleman in question,</li>
  <li class="number">Two other sons, who in the wars o' the time</li>
  <li>Died with their swords in hand; for which</li>
  <li>their father,</li>
  <li>Then old and fond of issue, took such sorrow</li>
  <li>That he quit being, and his gentle lady,</li>
  <li class="number">Big of this gentleman our theme, deceased</li>
  <li>As he was born. The king he takes the babe</li>
  <li>To his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,</li>
  <li>Breeds him and makes him of his bed-chamber,</li>
  <li>Puts to him all the learnings that his time</li>
  <li class="number">Could make him the receiver of; which he took,</li>
  <li>As we do air, fast as 'twas minister'd,</li>
  <li>And in's spring became a harvest, lived in court — </li>
  <li>Which rare it is to do — most praised, most loved,</li>
  <li>A sample to the youngest, to the more mature</li>
  <li class="number">A glass that feated them, and to the graver</li>
  <li>A child that guided dotards; to his mistress,</li>
  <li>For whom he now is banish'd, her own price</li>
  <li>Proclaims how she esteem'd him and his virtue;</li>
  <li>By her election may be truly read</li>
  <li class="number">What kind of man he is.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Gentleman</li>
  <li>I honour him</li>
  <li>Even out of your report. But, pray you, tell me,</li>
  <li>Is she sole child to the king?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Gentleman</li>
  <li>His only child.</li>
  <li class="number">He had two sons: if this be worth your hearing,</li>
  <li>Mark it: the eldest of them at three years old,</li>
  <li>I' the swathing-clothes the other, from their nursery</li>
  <li>Were stol'n, and to this hour no guess in knowledge</li>
  <li>Which way they went.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Gentleman</li>
  <li class="number">How long is this ago?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Gentleman</li>
  <li>Some twenty years.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Gentleman</li>
  <li>That a king's children should be so convey'd,</li>
  <li>So slackly guarded, and the search so slow,</li>
  <li>That could not trace them!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Gentleman</li>
  <li class="number">Howsoe'er 'tis strange,</li>
  <li>Or that the negligence may well be laugh'd at,</li>
  <li>Yet is it true, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Gentleman</li>
  <li>I do well believe you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Gentleman</li>
  <li>We must forbear: here comes the gentleman,</li>
  <li class="number">The queen, and princess.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt</div>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter the QUEEN, POSTHUMUS LEONATUS, and IMOGEN</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">QUEEN</li>
  <li>No, be assured you shall not find me, daughter,</li>
  <li>After the slander of most stepmothers,</li>
  <li>Evil-eyed unto you: you're my prisoner, but</li>
  <li>Your gaoler shall deliver you the keys</li>
  <li class="number">That lock up your restraint. For you, Posthumus,</li>
  <li>So soon as I can win the offended king,</li>
  <li>I will be known your advocate: marry, yet</li>
  <li>The fire of rage is in him, and 'twere good</li>
  <li>You lean'd unto his sentence with what patience</li>
  <li class="number">Your wisdom may inform you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</li>
  <li>Please your highness,</li>
  <li>I will from hence to-day.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">QUEEN</li>
  <li>You know the peril.</li>
  <li>I'll fetch a turn about the garden, pitying</li>
  <li class="number">The pangs of barr'd affections, though the king</li>
  <li>Hath charged you should not speak together.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IMOGEN</li>
  <li>O</li>
  <li>Dissembling courtesy! How fine this tyrant</li>
  <li>Can tickle where she wounds! My dearest husband,</li>
  <li class="number">I something fear my father's wrath; but nothing — </li>
  <li>Always reserved my holy duty — what</li>
  <li>His rage can do on me: you must be gone;</li>
  <li>And I shall here abide the hourly shot</li>
  <li>Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,</li>
  <li class="number">But that there is this jewel in the world</li>
  <li>That I may see again.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</li>
  <li>My queen! my mistress!</li>
  <li>O lady, weep no more, lest I give cause</li>
  <li>To be suspected of more tenderness</li>
  <li class="number">Than doth become a man. I will remain</li>
  <li>The loyal'st husband that did e'er plight troth:</li>
  <li>My residence in Rome at one Philario's,</li>
  <li>Who to my father was a friend, to me</li>
  <li>Known but by letter: thither write, my queen,</li>
  <li class="number">And with mine eyes I'll drink the words you send,</li>
  <li>Though ink be made of gall.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Re-enter QUEEN</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">QUEEN</li>
  <li>Be brief, I pray you:</li>
  <li>If the king come, I shall incur I know not</li>
  <li>How much of his displeasure.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Aside</li>
  <li class="number">Yet I'll move him</li>
  <li>To walk this way: I never do him wrong,</li>
  <li>But he does buy my injuries, to be friends;</li>
  <li>Pays dear for my offences.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</li>
  <li>Should we be taking leave</li>
  <li class="number">As long a term as yet we have to live,</li>
  <li>The loathness to depart would grow. Adieu!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IMOGEN</li>
  <li>Nay, stay a little:</li>
  <li>Were you but riding forth to air yourself,</li>
  <li>Such parting were too petty. Look here, love;</li>
  <li class="number">This diamond was my mother's: take it, heart;</li>
  <li>But keep it till you woo another wife,</li>
  <li>When Imogen is dead.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</li>
  <li>How, how! another?</li>
  <li>You gentle gods, give me but this I have,</li>
  <li class="number">And sear up my embracements from a next</li>
  <li>With bonds of death!</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Putting on the ring</li>
  <li>Remain, remain thou here</li>
  <li>While sense can keep it on. And, sweetest, fairest,</li>
  <li>As I my poor self did exchange for you,</li>
  <li class="number">To your so infinite loss, so in our trifles</li>
  <li>I still win of you: for my sake wear this;</li>
  <li>It is a manacle of love; I'll place it</li>
  <li>Upon this fairest prisoner.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Putting a bracelet upon her arm</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IMOGEN</li>
  <li>O the gods!</li>

  <li class="speaker">POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</li>
  <li>Alack, the king!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CYMBELINE</li>
  <li>Thou basest thing, avoid! hence, from my sight!</li>
  <li>If after this command thou fraught the court</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</li>
  <li>The gods protect you!</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IMOGEN</li>
  <li>There cannot be a pinch in death</li>
  <li>More sharp than this is.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CYMBELINE</li>
  <li class="number">O disloyal thing,</li>
  <li>That shouldst repair my youth, thou heap'st</li>
  <li>A year's age on me.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IMOGEN</li>
  <li>I beseech you, sir,</li>
  <li>Harm not yourself with your vexation</li>
  <li class="number">I am senseless of your wrath; a touch more rare</li>
  <li>Subdues all pangs, all fears.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CYMBELINE</li>
  <li>Past grace? obedience?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IMOGEN</li>
  <li>Past hope, and in despair; that way, past grace.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CYMBELINE</li>
  <li>That mightst have had the sole son of my queen!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IMOGEN</li>
  <li class="number">O blest, that I might not! I chose an eagle,</li>
  <li>And did avoid a puttock.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CYMBELINE</li>
  <li>Thou took'st a beggar; wouldst have made my throne</li>
  <li>A seat for baseness.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IMOGEN</li>
  <li>No; I rather added</li>
  <li class="number">A lustre to it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CYMBELINE</li>
  <li>O thou vile one!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IMOGEN</li>
  <li>Sir,</li>
  <li>It is your fault that I have loved Posthumus:</li>
  <li>You bred him as my playfellow, and he is</li>
  <li class="number">A man worth any woman, overbuys me</li>
  <li>Almost the sum he pays.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CYMBELINE</li>
  <li>What, art thou mad?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IMOGEN</li>
  <li>Almost, sir: heaven restore me! Would I were</li>

  <li class="number">Our neighbour shepherd's son!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CYMBELINE</li>
  <li>Thou foolish thing!</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Re-enter QUEEN</li>
  <li>They were again together: you have done</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PISANIO</li>

  <li>No harm, I trust, is done?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PISANIO</li>
  <li>There might have been,</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">QUEEN</li>
  <li>I am very glad on't.</li>

  <li>I would they were in Afric both together;</li>
  <li class="number">Myself by with a needle, that I might prick</li>
  <li>The goer-back. Why came you from your master?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PISANIO</li>
  <li>On his command: he would not suffer me</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter CLOTEN and two Lords</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Lord</li>
  <li>Sir, I would advise you to shift a shirt; the</li>

  <li>sacrifice: where air comes out, air comes in:</li>
  <li>there's none abroad so wholesome as that you vent.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CLOTEN</li>
  <li class="number">If my shirt were bloody, then to shift it. Have I hurt him?</li>

  <li class="speaker">Second Lord</li>
  <li>Aside  No, 'faith; not so much as his patience.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Lord</li>
  <li>Hurt him! his body's a passable carcass, if he be</li>
  <li>not hurt: it is a thoroughfare for steel, if it be not hurt.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Lord</li>

  <li class="speaker">First Lord</li>
  <li>Sir, as I told you always, her beauty and her brain</li>

  <li class="speaker">PISANIO</li>
  <li>No, madam; for so long</li>
  <li>As he could make me with this eye or ear</li>
  <li>Distinguish him from others, he did keep</li>
  <li>The deck, with glove, or hat, or handkerchief,</li>
  <li class="number">Still waving, as the fits and stirs of 's mind</li>
  <li>Could best express how slow his soul sail'd on,</li>
  <li>How swift his ship.</li>

  <li class="speaker">IMOGEN</li>

  <li class="speaker">PISANIO</li>
  <li>Madam, so I did.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IMOGEN</li>
  <li>I would have broke mine eye-strings; crack'd them, but</li>
  <li>To look upon him, till the diminution</li>
  <li>Of space had pointed him sharp as my needle,</li>
  <li class="number">Nay, follow'd him, till he had melted from</li>
  <li>The smallness of a gnat to air, and then</li>
  <li>Have turn'd mine eye and wept. But, good Pisanio,</li>
  <li>When shall we hear from him?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PISANIO</li>
  <li>Be assured, madam,</li>
  <li class="number">With his next vantage.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IMOGEN</li>
  <li>I did not take my leave of him, but had</li>
  <li>Most pretty things to say: ere I could tell him</li>
  <li>How I would think on him at certain hours</li>
  <li>Such thoughts and such, or I could make him swear</li>
  <li class="number">The shes of Italy should not betray</li>
  <li>Mine interest and his honour, or have charged him,</li>
  <li>At the sixth hour of morn, at noon, at midnight,</li>
  <li>To encounter me with orisons, for then</li>
  <li>I am in heaven for him; or ere I could</li>
  <li class="number">Give him that parting kiss which I had set</li>
  <li>Betwixt two charming words, comes in my father</li>

<h3>SCENE IV.  Rome. Philario's house.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter PHILARIO, IACHIMO, a Frenchman, a
Dutchman, and a Spaniard</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IACHIMO</li>
  <li>Believe it, sir, I have seen him in Britain: he was</li>
  <li>then of a crescent note, expected to prove so worthy</li>
  <li>as since he hath been allowed the name of; but I</li>
  <li>could then have looked on him without the help of</li>
  <li class="number">admiration, though the catalogue of his endowments</li>
  <li>had been tabled by his side and I to peruse him by items.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PHILARIO</li>
  <li>You speak of him when he was less furnished than now</li>
  <li>he is with that which makes him both without and within.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Frenchman</li>
  <li>I have seen him in France: we had very many there</li>
  <li class="number">could behold the sun with as firm eyes as he.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IACHIMO</li>
  <li>This matter of marrying his king's daughter, wherein</li>
  <li>he must be weighed rather by her value than his own,</li>
  <li>words him, I doubt not, a great deal from the matter.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Frenchman</li>
  <li>And then his banishment.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IACHIMO</li>
  <li class="number">Ay, and the approbation of those that weep this</li>
  <li>lamentable divorce under her colours are wonderfully</li>
  <li>to extend him; be it but to fortify her judgment,</li>
  <li>which else an easy battery might lay flat, for</li>
  <li>taking a beggar without less quality. But how comes</li>
  <li class="number">it he is to sojourn with you? How creeps</li>
  <li>acquaintance?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PHILARIO</li>
  <li>His father and I were soldiers together; to whom I</li>
  <li>have been often bound for no less than my life.</li>
  <li>Here comes the Briton: let him be so entertained</li>
  <li class="number">amongst you as suits, with gentlemen of your</li>
  <li>knowing, to a stranger of his quality.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</li>
  <li>I beseech you all, be better known to this</li>
  <li>gentleman; whom I commend to you as a noble friend</li>
  <li>of mine: how worthy he is I will leave to appear</li>
  <li class="number">hereafter, rather than story him in his own hearing.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Frenchman</li>
  <li>Sir, we have known together in Orleans.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</li>
  <li>Since when I have been debtor to you for courtesies,</li>
  <li>which I will be ever to pay and yet pay still.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Frenchman</li>
  <li>Sir, you o'er-rate my poor kindness: I was glad I</li>
  <li class="number">did atone my countryman and you; it had been pity</li>
  <li>you should have been put together with so mortal a</li>
  <li>purpose as then each bore, upon importance of so</li>
  <li>slight and trivial a nature.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</li>
  <li>By your pardon, sir, I was then a young traveller;</li>
  <li class="number">rather shunned to go even with what I heard than in</li>
  <li>my every action to be guided by others' experiences:</li>
  <li>but upon my mended judgment — if I offend not to say</li>
  <li>it is mended — my quarrel was not altogether slight.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Frenchman</li>
  <li>'Faith, yes, to be put to the arbitrement of swords,</li>
  <li class="number">and by such two that would by all likelihood have</li>
  <li>confounded one the other, or have fallen both.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IACHIMO</li>
  <li>Can we, with manners, ask what was the difference?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Frenchman</li>
  <li>Safely, I think: 'twas a contention in public,</li>
  <li>which may, without contradiction, suffer the report.</li>
  <li class="number">It was much like an argument that fell out last</li>
  <li>night, where each of us fell in praise of our</li>
  <li>country mistresses; this gentleman at that time</li>
  <li>vouching — and upon warrant of bloody</li>
  <li>affirmation — his to be more fair, virtuous, wise,</li>
  <li class="number">chaste, constant-qualified and less attemptable</li>
  <li>than any the rarest of our ladies in France.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IACHIMO</li>
  <li>That lady is not now living, or this gentleman's</li>
  <li>opinion by this worn out.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</li>
  <li>She holds her virtue still and I my mind.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IACHIMO</li>
  <li class="number">You must not so far prefer her 'fore ours of Italy.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</li>
  <li>Being so far provoked as I was in France, I would</li>
  <li>abate her nothing, though I profess myself her</li>
  <li>adorer, not her friend.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IACHIMO</li>
  <li>As fair and as good — a kind of hand-in-hand</li>
  <li class="number">comparison — had been something too fair and too good</li>
  <li>for any lady in Britain. If she went before others</li>
  <li>I have seen, as that diamond of yours outlustres</li>
  <li>many I have beheld. I could not but believe she</li>
  <li>excelled many: but I have not seen the most</li>
  <li class="number">precious diamond that is, nor you the lady.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</li>
  <li>I praised her as I rated her: so do I my stone.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IACHIMO</li>
  <li>What do you esteem it at?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</li>
  <li>More than the world enjoys.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IACHIMO</li>
  <li>Either your unparagoned mistress is dead, or she's</li>
  <li class="number">outprized by a trifle.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</li>
  <li>You are mistaken: the one may be sold, or given, if</li>
  <li>there were wealth enough for the purchase, or merit</li>
  <li>for the gift: the other is not a thing for sale,</li>
  <li>and only the gift of the gods.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IACHIMO</li>
  <li class="number">Which the gods have given you?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</li>
  <li>Which, by their graces, I will keep.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IACHIMO</li>
  <li>You may wear her in title yours: but, you know,</li>
  <li>strange fowl light upon neighbouring ponds. Your</li>
  <li>ring may be stolen too: so your brace of unprizable</li>
  <li class="number">estimations; the one is but frail and the other</li>
  <li>casual; a cunning thief, or a that way accomplished</li>
  <li>courtier, would hazard the winning both of first and last.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</li>
  <li>Your Italy contains none so accomplished a courtier</li>
  <li>to convince the honour of my mistress, if, in the</li>
  <li class="number">holding or loss of that, you term her frail. I do</li>
  <li>nothing doubt you have store of thieves;</li>
  <li>notwithstanding, I fear not my ring.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PHILARIO</li>
  <li>Let us leave here, gentlemen.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</li>
  <li>Sir, with all my heart. This worthy signior, I</li>
  <li class="number">thank him, makes no stranger of me; we are familiar at first.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IACHIMO</li>
  <li>With five times so much conversation, I should get</li>
  <li>ground of your fair mistress, make her go back, even</li>
  <li>to the yielding, had I admittance and opportunity to friend.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</li>
  <li>No, no.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IACHIMO</li>
  <li class="number">I dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to</li>
  <li>your ring; which, in my opinion, o'ervalues it</li>
  <li>something: but I make my wager rather against your</li>
  <li>confidence than her reputation: and, to bar your</li>
  <li>offence herein too, I durst attempt it against any</li>
  <li class="number">lady in the world.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</li>
  <li>You are a great deal abused in too bold a</li>
  <li>persuasion; and I doubt not you sustain what you're</li>
  <li>worthy of by your attempt.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IACHIMO</li>
  <li>What's that?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</li>
  <li class="number">A repulse: though your attempt, as you call it,</li>
  <li>deserve more; a punishment too.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PHILARIO</li>
  <li>Gentlemen, enough of this: it came in too suddenly;</li>
  <li>let it die as it was born, and, I pray you, be</li>
  <li>better acquainted.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IACHIMO</li>
  <li class="number">Would I had put my estate and my neighbour's on the</li>
  <li>approbation of what I have spoke!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</li>
  <li>What lady would you choose to assail?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IACHIMO</li>
  <li>Yours; whom in constancy you think stands so safe.</li>
  <li>I will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring,</li>
  <li class="number">that, commend me to the court where your lady is,</li>
  <li>with no more advantage than the opportunity of a</li>
  <li>second conference, and I will bring from thence</li>
  <li>that honour of hers which you imagine so reserved.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</li>
  <li>I will wage against your gold, gold to it: my ring</li>
  <li class="number">I hold dear as my finger; 'tis part of it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IACHIMO</li>
  <li>You are afraid, and therein the wiser. If you buy</li>
  <li>ladies' flesh at a million a dram, you cannot</li>
  <li>preserve it from tainting: but I see you have some</li>
  <li>religion in you, that you fear.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</li>
  <li class="number">This is but a custom in your tongue; you bear a</li>
  <li>graver purpose, I hope.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IACHIMO</li>
  <li>I am the master of my speeches, and would undergo</li>
  <li>what's spoken, I swear.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</li>
  <li>Will you? I shall but lend my diamond till your</li>
  <li class="number">return: let there be covenants drawn between's: my</li>
  <li>mistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness of your</li>
  <li>unworthy thinking: I dare you to this match: here's my ring.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PHILARIO</li>
  <li>I will have it no lay.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IACHIMO</li>
  <li>By the gods, it is one. If I bring you no</li>
  <li class="number">sufficient testimony that I have enjoyed the dearest</li>
  <li>bodily part of your mistress, my ten thousand ducats</li>
  <li>are yours; so is your diamond too: if I come off,</li>
  <li>and leave her in such honour as you have trust in,</li>
  <li>she your jewel, this your jewel, and my gold are</li>
  <li class="number">yours: provided I have your commendation for my more</li>
  <li>free entertainment.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</li>
  <li>I embrace these conditions; let us have articles</li>
  <li>betwixt us. Only, thus far you shall answer: if</li>
  <li>you make your voyage upon her and give me directly</li>
  <li class="number">to understand you have prevailed, I am no further</li>
  <li>your enemy; she is not worth our debate: if she</li>
  <li>remain unseduced, you not making it appear</li>
  <li>otherwise, for your ill opinion and the assault you</li>
  <li>have made to her chastity you shall answer me with</li>
  <li class="number">your sword.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IACHIMO</li>
  <li>Your hand; a covenant: we will have these things set</li>
  <li>down by lawful counsel, and straight away for</li>
  <li>Britain, lest the bargain should catch cold and</li>
  <li>starve: I will fetch my gold and have our two</li>

  <li>Pleaseth your highness, ay: here they are, madam:</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Presenting a small box</li>
  <li>But I beseech your grace, without offence —  </li>
  <li>My conscience bids me ask — wherefore you have</li>
  <li>Commanded of me those most poisonous compounds,</li>

  <li>But though slow, deadly?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">QUEEN</li>
  <li>I wonder, doctor,</li>
  <li>Thou ask'st me such a question. Have I not been</li>

  <li class="number">To make perfumes? distil? preserve? yea, so</li>
  <li>That our great king himself doth woo me oft</li>
  <li>For my confections? Having thus far proceeded —  </li>
  <li>Unless thou think'st me devilish — is't not meet</li>
  <li>That I did amplify my judgment in</li>
  <li class="number">Other conclusions? I will try the forces</li>
  <li>Of these thy compounds on such creatures as</li>
  <li>We count not worth the hanging, but none human,</li>
  <li>To try the vigour of them and apply</li>

  <li>Which first, perchance, she'll prove on</li>

  <li>No danger in what show of death it makes,</li>
  <li>More than the locking-up the spirits a time,</li>
  <li>To be more fresh, reviving. She is fool'd</li>
  <li class="number">With a most false effect; and I the truer,</li>
  <li>So to be false with her.</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter IMOGEN</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IMOGEN</li>
  <li>A father cruel, and a step-dame false;</li>
  <li>A foolish suitor to a wedded lady,</li>
  <li>That hath her husband banish'd; — O, that husband!</li>
  <li>My supreme crown of grief! and those repeated</li>
  <li class="number">Vexations of it! Had I been thief-stol'n,</li>
  <li>As my two brothers, happy! but most miserable</li>
  <li>Is the desire that's glorious: blest be those,</li>
  <li>How mean soe'er, that have their honest wills,</li>
  <li>Which seasons comfort. Who may this be? Fie!</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter PISANIO and IACHIMO</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PISANIO</li>
  <li class="number">Madam, a noble gentleman of Rome,</li>
  <li>Comes from my lord with letters.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IACHIMO</li>
  <li>Change you, madam?</li>
  <li>The worthy Leonatus is in safety</li>
  <li>And greets your highness dearly.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Presents a letter</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IMOGEN</li>
  <li class="number">Thanks, good sir:</li>
  <li>You're kindly welcome.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IACHIMO</li>
  <li>Aside  All of her that is out of door most rich!</li>
  <li>If she be furnish'd with a mind so rare,</li>
  <li>She is alone the Arabian bird, and I</li>
  <li class="number">Have lost the wager. Boldness be my friend!</li>
  <li>Arm me, audacity, from head to foot!</li>
  <li>Or, like the Parthian, I shall flying fight;</li>
  <li>Rather directly fly.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">

  <li>him accordingly, as you value your trust — </li>
  <li>LEONATUS.'</li>
  <li>So far I read aloud:</li>
  <li>But even the very middle of my heart</li>
  <li class="number">Is warm'd by the rest, and takes it thankfully.</li>
  <li>You are as welcome, worthy sir, as I</li>
  <li>Have words to bid you, and shall find it so</li>
  <li>In all that I can do.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IACHIMO</li>
  <li>Thanks, fairest lady.</li>
  <li class="number">What, are men mad? Hath nature given them eyes</li>
  <li>To see this vaulted arch, and the rich crop</li>
  <li>Of sea and land, which can distinguish 'twixt</li>
  <li>The fiery orbs above and the twinn'd stones</li>
  <li>Upon the number'd beach? and can we not</li>
  <li class="number">Partition make with spectacles so precious</li>
  <li>'Twixt fair and foul?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IMOGEN</li>
  <li>What makes your admiration?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IACHIMO</li>
  <li>It cannot be i' the eye, for apes and monkeys</li>
  <li>'Twixt two such shes would chatter this way and</li>
  <li class="number">Contemn with mows the other; nor i' the judgment,</li>
  <li>For idiots in this case of favour would</li>

  <li>Sluttery to such neat excellence opposed</li>
  <li>Should make desire vomit emptiness,</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IMOGEN</li>
  <li>What is the matter, trow?</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IACHIMO</li>
  <li>The cloyed will,</li>

  <li class="speaker">PISANIO</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IACHIMO</li>
  <li class="number">Well, madam.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IMOGEN</li>
  <li>Is he disposed to mirth? I hope he is.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IACHIMO</li>
  <li>Exceeding pleasant; none a stranger there</li>
  <li>So merry and so gamesome: he is call'd</li>
  <li>The Briton reveller.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IMOGEN</li>
  <li class="number">When he was here,</li>
  <li>He did incline to sadness, and oft-times</li>
  <li>Not knowing why.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IACHIMO</li>
  <li>I never saw him sad.</li>
  <li>There is a Frenchman his companion, one</li>
  <li class="number">An eminent monsieur, that, it seems, much loves</li>
  <li>A Gallian girl at home; he furnaces</li>
  <li>The thick sighs from him, whiles the jolly Briton — </li>
  <li>Your lord, I mean — laughs from's free lungs, cries 'O,</li>
  <li>Can my sides hold, to think that man, who knows</li>
  <li class="number">By history, report, or his own proof,</li>
  <li>What woman is, yea, what she cannot choose</li>
  <li>But must be, will his free hours languish for</li>
  <li>Assured bondage?'</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IMOGEN</li>
  <li>Will my lord say so?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IACHIMO</li>
  <li class="number">Ay, madam, with his eyes in flood with laughter:</li>
  <li>It is a recreation to be by</li>
  <li>And hear him mock the Frenchman. But, heavens know,</li>
  <li>Some men are much to blame.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IMOGEN</li>
  <li>Not he, I hope.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IACHIMO</li>
  <li class="number">Not he: but yet heaven's bounty towards him might</li>
  <li>Be used more thankfully. In himself, 'tis much;</li>
  <li>In you, which I account his beyond all talents,</li>
  <li>Whilst I am bound to wonder, I am bound</li>
  <li>To pity too.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IMOGEN</li>
  <li class="number">What do you pity, sir?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IACHIMO</li>
  <li>Two creatures heartily.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IMOGEN</li>
  <li>Am I one, sir?</li>
  <li>You look on me: what wreck discern you in me</li>
  <li>Deserves your pity?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IACHIMO</li>
  <li class="number">Lamentable! What,</li>
  <li>To hide me from the radiant sun and solace</li>
  <li>I' the dungeon by a snuff?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IMOGEN</li>
  <li>I pray you, sir,</li>
  <li>Deliver with more openness your answers</li>
  <li class="number">To my demands. Why do you pity me?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IACHIMO</li>
  <li>That others do — </li>
  <li>I was about to say — enjoy your — But</li>
  <li>It is an office of the gods to venge it,</li>
  <li>Not mine to speak on 't.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IMOGEN</li>
  <li class="number">You do seem to know</li>
  <li>Something of me, or what concerns me: pray you —  </li>
  <li>Since doubling things go ill often hurts more</li>
  <li>Than to be sure they do; for certainties</li>
  <li>Either are past remedies, or, timely knowing,</li>
  <li class="number">The remedy then born — discover to me</li>
  <li>What both you spur and stop.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IACHIMO</li>
  <li>Had I this cheek</li>
  <li>To bathe my lips upon; this hand, whose touch,</li>
  <li>Whose every touch, would force the feeler's soul</li>
  <li class="number">To the oath of loyalty; this object, which</li>
  <li>Takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye,</li>
  <li>Fixing it only here; should I, damn'd then,</li>
  <li>Slaver with lips as common as the stairs</li>
  <li>That mount the Capitol; join gripes with hands</li>
  <li class="number">Made hard with hourly falsehood — falsehood, as</li>
  <li>With labour; then by-peeping in an eye</li>
  <li>Base and unlustrous as the smoky light</li>
  <li>That's fed with stinking tallow; it were fit</li>
  <li>That all the plagues of hell should at one time</li>
  <li class="number">Encounter such revolt.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IMOGEN</li>
  <li>My lord, I fear,</li>
  <li>Has forgot Britain.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IACHIMO</li>
  <li>And himself. Not I,</li>
  <li>Inclined to this intelligence, pronounce</li>
  <li class="number">The beggary of his change; but 'tis your graces</li>
  <li>That from pay mutest conscience to my tongue</li>
  <li>Charms this report out.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IMOGEN</li>
  <li>Let me hear no more.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IACHIMO</li>
  <li>O dearest soul! your cause doth strike my heart</li>
  <li class="number">With pity, that doth make me sick. A lady</li>
  <li>So fair, and fasten'd to an empery,</li>
  <li>Would make the great'st king double —  to be partner'd</li>
  <li>With tomboys hired with that self-exhibition</li>
  <li>Which your own coffers yield! with diseased ventures</li>
  <li class="number">That play with all infirmities for gold</li>
  <li>Which rottenness can lend nature! such boil'd stuff</li>
  <li>As well might poison poison! Be revenged;</li>
  <li>Or she that bore you was no queen, and you</li>
  <li>Recoil from your great stock.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IMOGEN</li>
  <li class="number">Revenged!</li>
  <li>How should I be revenged? If this be true —  </li>
  <li>As I have such a heart that both mine ears</li>
  <li>Must not in haste abuse — if it be true,</li>
  <li>How should I be revenged?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IACHIMO</li>
  <li class="number">Should he make me</li>
  <li>Live, like Diana's priest, betwixt cold sheets,</li>
  <li>Whiles he is vaulting variable ramps,</li>
  <li>In your despite, upon your purse? Revenge it.</li>
  <li>I dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure,</li>
  <li class="number">More noble than that runagate to your bed,</li>
  <li>And will continue fast to your affection,</li>
  <li>Still close as sure.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IMOGEN</li>
  <li>What, ho, Pisanio!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IACHIMO</li>
  <li>Let me my service tender on your lips.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IMOGEN</li>
  <li class="number">Away! I do condemn mine ears that have</li>
  <li>So long attended thee. If thou wert honourable,</li>
  <li>Thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue, not</li>
  <li>For such an end thou seek'st —  as base as strange.</li>
  <li>Thou wrong'st a gentleman, who is as far</li>
  <li class="number">From thy report as thou from honour, and</li>
  <li>Solicit'st here a lady that disdains</li>
  <li>Thee and the devil alike. What ho, Pisanio!</li>
  <li>The king my father shall be made acquainted</li>
  <li>Of thy assault: if he shall think it fit,</li>
  <li class="number">A saucy stranger in his court to mart</li>
  <li>As in a Romish stew and to expound</li>
  <li>His beastly mind to us, he hath a court</li>
  <li>He little cares for and a daughter who</li>
  <li>He not respects at all. What, ho, Pisanio!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IACHIMO</li>
  <li class="number">O happy Leonatus! I may say</li>
  <li>The credit that thy lady hath of thee</li>
  <li>Deserves thy trust, and thy most perfect goodness</li>
  <li>Her assured credit. Blessed live you long!</li>
  <li>A lady to the worthiest sir that ever</li>
  <li class="number">Country call'd his! and you his mistress, only</li>
  <li>For the most worthiest fit! Give me your pardon.</li>
  <li>I have spoke this, to know if your affiance</li>
  <li>Were deeply rooted; and shall make your lord,</li>
  <li>That which he is, new o'er: and he is one</li>
  <li class="number">The truest manner'd; such a holy witch</li>
  <li>That he enchants societies into him;</li>
  <li>Half all men's hearts are his.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IMOGEN</li>
  <li>You make amends.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IACHIMO</li>
  <li>He sits 'mongst men like a descended god:</li>
  <li class="number">He hath a kind of honour sets him off,</li>
  <li>More than a mortal seeming. Be not angry,</li>
  <li>Most mighty princess, that I have adventured</li>
  <li>To try your taking a false report; which hath</li>
  <li>Honour'd with confirmation your great judgment</li>
  <li class="number">In the election of a sir so rare,</li>
  <li>Which you know cannot err: the love I bear him</li>
  <li>Made me to fan you thus, but the gods made you,</li>
  <li>Unlike all others, chaffless. Pray, your pardon.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IMOGEN</li>
  <li>All's well, sir: take my power i' the court</li>
  <li class="number">for yours.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IACHIMO</li>
  <li>My humble thanks. I had almost forgot</li>
  <li>To entreat your grace but in a small request,</li>
  <li>And yet of moment to, for it concerns</li>
  <li>Your lord; myself and other noble friends,</li>
  <li class="number">Are partners in the business.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IMOGEN</li>
  <li>Pray, what is't?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IACHIMO</li>
  <li>Some dozen Romans of us and your lord — </li>
  <li>The best feather of our wing — have mingled sums</li>
  <li>To buy a present for the emperor</li>
  <li class="number">Which I, the factor for the rest, have done</li>
  <li>In France: 'tis plate of rare device, and jewels</li>
  <li>Of rich and exquisite form; their values great;</li>
  <li>And I am something curious, being strange,</li>
  <li>To have them in safe stowage: may it please you</li>
  <li class="number">To take them in protection?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IMOGEN</li>
  <li>Willingly;</li>
  <li>And pawn mine honour for their safety: since</li>
  <li>My lord hath interest in them, I will keep them</li>
  <li>In my bedchamber.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IACHIMO</li>
  <li class="number">They are in a trunk,</li>
  <li>Attended by my men: I will make bold</li>
  <li>To send them to you, only for this night;</li>
  <li>I must aboard to-morrow.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IMOGEN</li>
  <li>O, no, no.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IACHIMO</li>
  <li class="number">Yes, I beseech; or I shall short my word</li>
  <li>By lengthening my return. From Gallia</li>
  <li>I cross'd the seas on purpose and on promise</li>
  <li>To see your grace.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IMOGEN</li>
  <li>I thank you for your pains:</li>
  <li class="number">But not away to-morrow!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IACHIMO</li>
  <li>O, I must, madam:</li>
  <li>Therefore I shall beseech you, if you please</li>
  <li>To greet your lord with writing, do't to-night:</li>
  <li>I have outstood my time; which is material</li>
  <li class="number">To the tender of our present.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IMOGEN</li>
  <li>I will write.</li>
  <li>Send your trunk to me; it shall safe be kept,</li>
  <li>And truly yielded you. You're very welcome.</li>

  <li>Was there ever man had such luck! when I kissed the</li>

  <li>hundred pound on't: and then a whoreson jackanapes</li>
  <li>must take me up for swearing; as if I borrowed mine</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Lord</li>
  <li>What got he by that? You have broke his pate with</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CLOTEN</li>
  <li>I am not vexed more at any thing in the earth: a</li>
  <li>pox on't! I had rather not be so noble as I am;</li>
  <li>they dare not fight with me, because of the queen my</li>

  <li>No, I know that: but it is fit I should commit</li>

  <li class="number">I have read three hours then: mine eyes are weak:</li>
  <li>Fold down the leaf where I have left: to bed:</li>
  <li>Take not away the taper, leave it burning;</li>

  <li>The crickets sing, and man's o'er-labour'd sense</li>
  <li>Repairs itself by rest. Our Tarquin thus</li>
  <li class="number">Did softly press the rushes, ere he waken'd</li>
  <li>The chastity he wounded. Cytherea,</li>
  <li>How bravely thou becomest thy bed, fresh lily,</li>
  <li>And whiter than the sheets! That I might touch!</li>
  <li>But kiss; one kiss! Rubies unparagon'd,</li>
  <li class="number">How dearly they do't! 'Tis her breathing that</li>
  <li>Perfumes the chamber thus: the flame o' the taper</li>
  <li>Bows toward her, and would under-peep her lids,</li>
  <li>To see the enclosed lights, now canopied</li>
  <li>Under these windows, white and azure laced</li>
  <li class="number">With blue of heaven's own tinct. But my design,</li>
  <li>To note the chamber: I will write all down:</li>
  <li>Such and such pictures; there the window; such</li>
  <li>The adornment of her bed; the arras; figures,</li>
  <li>Why, such and such; and the contents o' the story.</li>
  <li class="number">Ah, but some natural notes about her body,</li>
  <li>Above ten thousand meaner moveables</li>
  <li>Would testify, to enrich mine inventory.</li>
  <li>O sleep, thou ape of death, lie dull upon her!</li>
  <li>And be her sense but as a monument,</li>
  <li class="number">Thus in a chapel lying! Come off, come off:</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Taking off her bracelet</li>
  <li>As slippery as the Gordian knot was hard!</li>
  <li>'Tis mine; and this will witness outwardly,</li>
  <li>As strongly as the conscience does within,</li>
  <li>To the madding of her lord. On her left breast</li>
  <li class="number">A mole cinque-spotted, like the crimson drops</li>
  <li>I' the bottom of a cowslip: here's a voucher,</li>
  <li>Stronger than ever law could make: this secret</li>
  <li>Will force him think I have pick'd the lock and ta'en</li>
  <li>The treasure of her honour. No more. To what end?</li>
  <li class="number">Why should I write this down, that's riveted,</li>
  <li>Screw'd to my memory? She hath been reading late</li>
  <li>The tale of Tereus; here the leaf's turn'd down</li>
  <li>Where Philomel gave up. I have enough:</li>
  <li>To the trunk again, and shut the spring of it.</li>
  <li class="number">Swift, swift, you dragons of the night, that dawning</li>
  <li>May bare the raven's eye! I lodge in fear;</li>
  <li>Though this a heavenly angel, hell is here.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Clock strikes</li>
  <li>One, two, three: time, time!</li>

  <li>Of her or you, having proceeded but</li>
  <li class="number">By both your wills.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</li>
  <li>If you can make't apparent</li>
  <li>That you have tasted her in bed, my hand</li>
  <li>And ring is yours; if not, the foul opinion</li>
  <li>You had of her pure honour gains or loses</li>
  <li class="number">Your sword or mine, or masterless leaves both</li>
  <li>To who shall find them.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IACHIMO</li>
  <li>Sir, my circumstances,</li>
  <li>Being so near the truth as I will make them,</li>
  <li>Must first induce you to believe: whose strength</li>
  <li class="number">I will confirm with oath; which, I doubt not,</li>
  <li>You'll give me leave to spare, when you shall find</li>
  <li>You need it not.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</li>
  <li>Proceed.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IACHIMO</li>
  <li>First, her bedchamber —  </li>
  <li class="number">Where, I confess, I slept not, but profess</li>
  <li>Had that was well worth watching — it was hang'd</li>
  <li>With tapesty of silk and silver; the story</li>
  <li>Proud Cleopatra, when she met her Roman,</li>
  <li>And Cydnus swell'd above the banks, or for</li>
  <li class="number">The press of boats or pride: a piece of work</li>
  <li>So bravely done, so rich, that it did strive</li>
  <li>In workmanship and value; which I wonder'd</li>
  <li>Could be so rarely and exactly wrought,</li>
  <li>Since the true life on't was — </li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</li>
  <li class="number">This is true;</li>
  <li>And this you might have heard of here, by me,</li>
  <li>Or by some other.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IACHIMO</li>
  <li>More particulars</li>
  <li>Must justify my knowledge.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</li>
  <li class="number">So they must,</li>
  <li>Or do your honour injury.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IACHIMO</li>
  <li>The chimney</li>
  <li>Is south the chamber, and the chimney-piece</li>
  <li>Chaste Dian bathing: never saw I figures</li>
  <li class="number">So likely to report themselves: the cutter</li>
  <li>Was as another nature, dumb; outwent her,</li>
  <li>Motion and breath left out.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</li>
  <li>This is a thing</li>
  <li>Which you might from relation likewise reap,</li>
  <li class="number">Being, as it is, much spoke of.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IACHIMO</li>
  <li>The roof o' the chamber</li>
  <li>With golden cherubins is fretted: her andirons — </li>
  <li>I had forgot them — were two winking Cupids</li>
  <li>Of silver, each on one foot standing, nicely</li>
  <li class="number">Depending on their brands.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</li>
  <li>This is her honour!</li>
  <li>Let it be granted you have seen all this — and praise</li>
  <li>Be given to your remembrance — the description</li>
  <li>Of what is in her chamber nothing saves</li>
  <li class="number">The wager you have laid.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IACHIMO</li>
  <li>Then, if you can,</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Showing the bracelet</li>
  <li>Be pale: I beg but leave to air this jewel; see!</li>
  <li>And now 'tis up again: it must be married</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</li>
  <li class="number">Jove!</li>
  <li>Once more let me behold it: is it that</li>
  <li>Which I left with her?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IACHIMO</li>
  <li>Sir — I thank her — that:</li>
  <li>She stripp'd it from her arm; I see her yet;</li>
  <li class="number">Her pretty action did outsell her gift,</li>
  <li>And yet enrich'd it too: she gave it me, and said</li>
  <li>She prized it once.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</li>
  <li>May be she pluck'd it off</li>
  <li>To send it me.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IACHIMO</li>
  <li class="number">She writes so to you, doth she?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</li>
  <li>O, no, no, no! 'tis true. Here, take this too;</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Gives the ring</li>
  <li>It is a basilisk unto mine eye,</li>
  <li>Kills me to look on't. Let there be no honour</li>
  <li>Where there is beauty; truth, where semblance; love,</li>
  <li class="number">Where there's another man: the vows of women</li>
  <li>Of no more bondage be, to where they are made,</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</li>
  <li>Very true;</li>
  <li class="number">And so, I hope, he came by't. Back my ring:</li>
  <li>Render to me some corporal sign about her,</li>
  <li>More evident than this; for this was stolen.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IACHIMO</li>
  <li>By Jupiter, I had it from her arm.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">

  <li>Hark you, he swears; by Jupiter he swears.</li>
  <li class="number">'Tis true: — nay, keep the ring — 'tis true: I am sure</li>
  <li>She would not lose it: her attendants are</li>
  <li>All sworn and honourable: — they induced to steal it!</li>
  <li>And by a stranger! — No, he hath enjoyed her:</li>
  <li>The cognizance of her incontinency</li>
  <li class="number">Is this: she hath bought the name of whore</li>
  <li>thus dearly.</li>
  <li>There, take thy hire; and all the fiends of hell</li>
  <li>Divide themselves between you!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">

  <li>If you seek</li>
  <li class="number">For further satisfying, under her breast — </li>

<h3>SCENE I.  Britain. A hall in Cymbeline's palace.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter in state, CYMBELINE, QUEEN, CLOTEN,
and Lords at one door, and at another,
CAIUS LUCIUS and Attendants</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CYMBELINE</li>
  <li>Now say, what would Augustus Caesar with us?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAIUS LUCIUS</li>
  <li>When Julius Caesar, whose remembrance yet</li>
  <li>Lives in men's eyes and will to ears and tongues</li>
  <li>Be theme and hearing ever, was in this Britain</li>
  <li class="number">And conquer'd it, Cassibelan, thine uncle —  </li>
  <li>Famous in Caesar's praises, no whit less</li>
  <li>Than in his feats deserving it — for him</li>
  <li>And his succession granted Rome a tribute,</li>
  <li>Yearly three thousand pounds, which by thee lately</li>
  <li class="number">Is left untender'd.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">QUEEN</li>
  <li>And, to kill the marvel,</li>
  <li>Shall be so ever.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CLOTEN</li>
  <li>There be many Caesars,</li>
  <li>Ere such another Julius. Britain is</li>
  <li class="number">A world by itself; and we will nothing pay</li>
  <li>For wearing our own noses.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">QUEEN</li>
  <li>That opportunity</li>
  <li>Which then they had to take from 's, to resume</li>
  <li>We have again. Remember, sir, my liege,</li>
  <li class="number">The kings your ancestors, together with</li>
  <li>The natural bravery of your isle, which stands</li>
  <li>As Neptune's park, ribbed and paled in</li>
  <li>With rocks unscalable and roaring waters,</li>
  <li>With sands that will not bear your enemies' boats,</li>
  <li class="number">But suck them up to the topmast. A kind of conquest</li>
  <li>Caesar made here; but made not here his brag</li>
  <li>Of 'Came' and 'saw' and 'overcame: ' with shame — </li>
  <li>That first that ever touch'd him — he was carried</li>
  <li>From off our coast, twice beaten; and his shipping — </li>
  <li class="number">Poor ignorant baubles! —  upon our terrible seas,</li>
  <li>Like egg-shells moved upon their surges, crack'd</li>
  <li>As easily 'gainst our rocks: for joy whereof</li>
  <li>The famed Cassibelan, who was once at point — </li>
  <li>O giglot fortune! — to master Caesar's sword,</li>
  <li class="number">Made Lud's town with rejoicing fires bright</li>
  <li>And Britons strut with courage.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CLOTEN</li>
  <li>Come, there's no more tribute to be paid: our</li>
  <li>kingdom is stronger than it was at that time; and,</li>
  <li>as I said, there is no moe such Caesars: other of</li>
  <li class="number">them may have crook'd noses, but to owe such</li>
  <li>straight arms, none.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CYMBELINE</li>
  <li>Son, let your mother end.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CLOTEN</li>
  <li>We have yet many among us can gripe as hard as</li>
  <li>Cassibelan: I do not say I am one; but I have a</li>
  <li class="number">hand. Why tribute? why should we pay tribute? If</li>
  <li>Caesar can hide the sun from us with a blanket, or</li>
  <li>put the moon in his pocket, we will pay him tribute</li>
  <li>for light; else, sir, no more tribute, pray you now.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CYMBELINE</li>
  <li>You must know,</li>
  <li class="number">Till the injurious Romans did extort</li>
  <li>This tribute from us, we were free:</li>
  <li>Caesar's ambition,</li>
  <li>Which swell'd so much that it did almost stretch</li>
  <li>The sides o' the world, against all colour here</li>
  <li class="number">Did put the yoke upon 's; which to shake off</li>
  <li>Becomes a warlike people, whom we reckon</li>
  <li>Ourselves to be.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CLOTEN</li>
  <li class="speaker">Lords</li>
  <li>We do.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CYMBELINE</li>
  <li>Say, then, to Caesar,</li>
  <li class="number">Our ancestor was that Mulmutius which</li>
  <li>Ordain'd our laws, whose use the sword of Caesar</li>
  <li>Hath too much mangled; whose repair and franchise</li>
  <li>Shall, by the power we hold, be our good deed,</li>
  <li>Though Rome be therefore angry: Mulmutius made our laws,</li>
  <li class="number">Who was the first of Britain which did put</li>
  <li>His brows within a golden crown and call'd</li>
  <li>Himself a king.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAIUS LUCIUS</li>
  <li>I am sorry, Cymbeline,</li>
  <li>That I am to pronounce Augustus Caesar — </li>
  <li class="number">Caesar, that hath more kings his servants than</li>
  <li>Thyself domestic officers — thine enemy:</li>
  <li>Receive it from me, then: war and confusion</li>
  <li>In Caesar's name pronounce I 'gainst thee: look</li>
  <li>For fury not to be resisted. Thus defied,</li>
  <li class="number">I thank thee for myself.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CYMBELINE</li>
  <li>Thou art welcome, Caius.</li>
  <li>Thy Caesar knighted me; my youth I spent</li>
  <li>Much under him; of him I gather'd honour;</li>
  <li>Which he to seek of me again, perforce,</li>
  <li class="number">Behoves me keep at utterance. I am perfect</li>
  <li>That the Pannonians and Dalmatians for</li>
  <li>Their liberties are now in arms; a precedent</li>
  <li>Which not to read would show the Britons cold:</li>
  <li>So Caesar shall not find them.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAIUS LUCIUS</li>
  <li class="number">Let proof speak.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CLOTEN</li>
  <li>His majesty bids you welcome. Make</li>
  <li>pastime with us a day or two, or longer: if</li>
  <li>you seek us afterwards in other terms, you</li>
  <li>shall find us in our salt-water girdle: if you</li>
  <li class="number">beat us out of it, it is yours; if you fall in</li>
  <li>the adventure, our crows shall fare the better</li>

  <li>Why, one that rode to's execution, man,</li>

  <li>Go bid my woman feign a sickness; say</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BELARIUS</li>
  <li>A goodly day not to keep house, with such</li>
  <li>Whose roof's as low as ours! Stoop, boys; this gate</li>
  <li>Instructs you how to adore the heavens and bows you</li>
  <li>To a morning's holy office: the gates of monarchs</li>
  <li class="number">Are arch'd so high that giants may jet through</li>
  <li>And keep their impious turbans on, without</li>
  <li>Good morrow to the sun. Hail, thou fair heaven!</li>
  <li>We house i' the rock, yet use thee not so hardly</li>
  <li>As prouder livers do.</li>

  <li>Hail, heaven!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BELARIUS</li>
  <li>Now for our mountain sport: up to yond hill;</li>
  <li>Your legs are young; I'll tread these flats. Consider,</li>
  <li>When you above perceive me like a crow,</li>
  <li class="number">That it is place which lessens and sets off;</li>
  <li>And you may then revolve what tales I have told you</li>
  <li>Of courts, of princes, of the tricks in war:</li>
  <li>This service is not service, so being done,</li>
  <li>But being so allow'd: to apprehend thus,</li>
  <li class="number">Draws us a profit from all things we see;</li>
  <li>And often, to our comfort, shall we find</li>
  <li>The sharded beetle in a safer hold</li>
  <li>Than is the full-wing'd eagle. O, this life</li>
  <li>Is nobler than attending for a cheque,</li>
  <li class="number">Richer than doing nothing for a bauble,</li>
  <li>Prouder than rustling in unpaid-for silk:</li>
  <li>Such gain the cap of him that makes 'em fine,</li>
  <li>Yet keeps his book uncross'd: no life to ours.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GUIDERIUS</li>
  <li>Out of your proof you speak: we, poor unfledged,</li>
  <li class="number">Have never wing'd from view o' the nest, nor know not</li>
  <li>What air's from home. Haply this life is best,</li>
  <li>If quiet life be best; sweeter to you</li>
  <li>That have a sharper known; well corresponding</li>
  <li>With your stiff age: but unto us it is</li>
  <li class="number">A cell of ignorance; travelling a-bed;</li>
  <li>A prison for a debtor, that not dares</li>
  <li>To stride a limit.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ARVIRAGUS</li>
  <li>What should we speak of</li>
  <li>When we are old as you? when we shall hear</li>
  <li class="number">The rain and wind beat dark December, how,</li>
  <li>In this our pinching cave, shall we discourse</li>
  <li>The freezing hours away? We have seen nothing;</li>
  <li>We are beastly, subtle as the fox for prey,</li>
  <li>Like warlike as the wolf for what we eat;</li>
  <li class="number">Our valour is to chase what flies; our cage</li>
  <li>We make a quire, as doth the prison'd bird,</li>
  <li>And sing our bondage freely.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">BELARIUS</li>
  <li>How you speak!</li>
  <li>Did you but know the city's usuries</li>

  <li>As hard to leave as keep; whose top to climb</li>

  <li>The fear's as bad as falling; the toil o' the war,</li>
  <li>A pain that only seems to seek out danger</li>
  <li class="number">I' the name of fame and honour; which dies i'</li>
  <li>the search,</li>
  <li>And hath as oft a slanderous epitaph</li>
  <li>As record of fair act; nay, many times,</li>
  <li>Doth ill deserve by doing well; what's worse,</li>
  <li class="number">Must court'sy at the censure: — O boys, this story</li>
  <li>The world may read in me: my body's mark'd</li>
  <li>With Roman swords, and my report was once</li>
  <li>First with the best of note: Cymbeline loved me,</li>
  <li>And when a soldier was the theme, my name</li>
  <li class="number">Was not far off: then was I as a tree</li>
  <li>Whose boughs did bend with fruit: but in one night,</li>
  <li>A storm or robbery, call it what you will,</li>
  <li>Shook down my mellow hangings, nay, my leaves,</li>
  <li>And left me bare to weather.</li>

  <li class="speaker">BELARIUS</li>
  <li>My fault being nothing — as I have told you oft — </li>
  <li>But that two villains, whose false oaths prevail'd</li>
  <li>Before my perfect honour, swore to Cymbeline</li>
  <li>I was confederate with the Romans: so</li>
  <li class="number">Follow'd my banishment, and this twenty years</li>
  <li>This rock and these demesnes have been my world;</li>
  <li>Where I have lived at honest freedom, paid</li>
  <li>More pious debts to heaven than in all</li>
  <li>The fore-end of my time. But up to the mountains!</li>
  <li class="number">This is not hunters' language: he that strikes</li>
  <li>The venison first shall be the lord o' the feast;</li>
  <li>To him the other two shall minister;</li>
  <li>And we will fear no poison, which attends</li>
  <li>In place of greater state. I'll meet you in the valleys.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Exeunt GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS</li>
  <li class="number">How hard it is to hide the sparks of nature!</li>
  <li>These boys know little they are sons to the king;</li>
  <li>Nor Cymbeline dreams that they are alive.</li>
  <li>They think they are mine; and though train'd</li>
  <li>up thus meanly</li>
  <li class="number">I' the cave wherein they bow, their thoughts do hit</li>
  <li>The roofs of palaces, and nature prompts them</li>
  <li>In simple and low things to prince it much</li>
  <li>Beyond the trick of others. This Polydore,</li>
  <li>The heir of Cymbeline and Britain, who</li>
  <li class="number">The king his father call'd Guiderius —  Jove!</li>
  <li>When on my three-foot stool I sit and tell</li>
  <li>The warlike feats I have done, his spirits fly out</li>
  <li>Into my story: say 'Thus, mine enemy fell,</li>
  <li>And thus I set my foot on 's neck;' even then</li>
  <li class="number">The princely blood flows in his cheek, he sweats,</li>
  <li>Strains his young nerves and puts himself in posture</li>
  <li>That acts my words. The younger brother, Cadwal,</li>
  <li>Once Arviragus, in as like a figure,</li>
  <li>Strikes life into my speech and shows much more</li>
  <li class="number">His own conceiving. — Hark, the game is roused!</li>
  <li>O Cymbeline! heaven and my conscience knows</li>
  <li>Thou didst unjustly banish me: whereon,</li>
  <li>At three and two years old, I stole these babes;</li>
  <li>Thinking to bar thee of succession, as</li>
  <li class="number">Thou reft'st me of my lands. Euriphile,</li>
  <li>Thou wast their nurse; they took thee for</li>
  <li>their mother,</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter PISANIO and IMOGEN</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IMOGEN</li>
  <li>Thou told'st me, when we came from horse, the place</li>
  <li>Was near at hand: ne'er long'd my mother so</li>
  <li>To see me first, as I have now. Pisanio! man!</li>
  <li>Where is Posthumus? What is in thy mind,</li>
  <li class="number">That makes thee stare thus? Wherefore breaks that sigh</li>
  <li>From the inward of thee? One, but painted thus,</li>
  <li>Would be interpreted a thing perplex'd</li>
  <li>Beyond self-explication: put thyself</li>
  <li>Into a havior of less fear, ere wildness</li>
  <li class="number">Vanquish my staider senses. What's the matter?</li>
  <li>Why tender'st thou that paper to me, with</li>
  <li>A look untender? If't be summer news,</li>
  <li>Smile to't before; if winterly, thou need'st</li>
  <li>But keep that countenance still. My husband's hand!</li>
  <li class="number">That drug-damn'd Italy hath out-craftied him,</li>
  <li>And he's at some hard point. Speak, man: thy tongue</li>
  <li>May take off some extremity, which to read</li>
  <li>Would be even mortal to me.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PISANIO</li>
  <li>Please you, read;</li>
  <li class="number">And you shall find me, wretched man, a thing</li>
  <li>The most disdain'd of fortune.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IMOGEN</li>
  <li>Reads  'Thy mistress, Pisanio, hath played the</li>
  <li>strumpet in my bed; the testimonies whereof lie</li>
  <li>bleeding in me. I speak not out of weak surmises,</li>
  <li class="number">but from proof as strong as my grief and as certain</li>
  <li>as I expect my revenge. That part thou, Pisanio,</li>
  <li>must act for me, if thy faith be not tainted with</li>
  <li>the breach of hers. Let thine own hands take away</li>
  <li>her life: I shall give thee opportunity at</li>
  <li class="number">Milford-Haven. She hath my letter for the purpose</li>
  <li>where, if thou fear to strike and to make me certain</li>
  <li>it is done, thou art the pandar to her dishonour and</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PISANIO</li>
  <li>What shall I need to draw my sword? the paper</li>
  <li class="number">Hath cut her throat already. No, 'tis slander,</li>

  <li>Outvenoms all the worms of Nile, whose breath</li>
  <li>Rides on the posting winds and doth belie</li>
  <li>All corners of the world: kings, queens and states,</li>
  <li class="number">Maids, matrons, nay, the secrets of the grave</li>
  <li>This viperous slander enters. What cheer, madam?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IMOGEN</li>
  <li>False to his bed! What is it to be false?</li>
  <li>To lie in watch there and to think on him?</li>
  <li>To weep 'twixt clock and clock? if sleep</li>
  <li class="number">charge nature,</li>
  <li>To break it with a fearful dream of him</li>
  <li>And cry myself awake? that's false to's bed, is it?</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PISANIO</li>
  <li>Alas, good lady!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IMOGEN</li>
  <li>I false! Thy conscience witness: Iachimo,</li>
  <li class="number">Thou didst accuse him of incontinency;</li>
  <li>Thou then look'dst like a villain; now methinks</li>
  <li>Thy favour's good enough. Some jay of Italy</li>
  <li>Whose mother was her painting, hath betray'd him:</li>
  <li>Poor I am stale, a garment out of fashion;</li>
  <li class="number">And, for I am richer than to hang by the walls,</li>
  <li>I must be ripp'd: — to pieces with me! — O,</li>
  <li>Men's vows are women's traitors! All good seeming,</li>
  <li>By thy revolt, O husband, shall be thought</li>
  <li>Put on for villany; not born where't grows,</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PISANIO</li>
  <li>Good madam, hear me.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IMOGEN</li>
  <li>True honest men being heard, like false Aeneas,</li>
  <li>Were in his time thought false, and Sinon's weeping</li>
  <li>Did scandal many a holy tear, took pity</li>
  <li class="number">From most true wretchedness: so thou, Posthumus,</li>
  <li>Wilt lay the leaven on all proper men;</li>
  <li>Goodly and gallant shall be false and perjured</li>
  <li>From thy great fall. Come, fellow, be thou honest:</li>
  <li>Do thou thy master's bidding: when thou see'st him,</li>
  <li class="number">A little witness my obedience: look!</li>
  <li>I draw the sword myself: take it, and hit</li>
  <li>The innocent mansion of my love, my heart;</li>
  <li>Fear not; 'tis empty of all things but grief;</li>
  <li>Thy master is not there, who was indeed</li>
  <li class="number">The riches of it: do his bidding; strike</li>
  <li>Thou mayst be valiant in a better cause;</li>
  <li>But now thou seem'st a coward.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PISANIO</li>
  <li>Hence, vile instrument!</li>
  <li>Thou shalt not damn my hand.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IMOGEN</li>
  <li class="number">Why, I must die;</li>
  <li>And if I do not by thy hand, thou art</li>
  <li>No servant of thy master's. Against self-slaughter</li>
  <li>There is a prohibition so divine</li>
  <li>That cravens my weak hand. Come, here's my heart.</li>
  <li class="number">Something's afore't. Soft, soft! we'll no defence;</li>
  <li>Obedient as the scabbard. What is here?</li>
  <li>The scriptures of the loyal Leonatus,</li>
  <li>All turn'd to heresy? Away, away,</li>
  <li>Corrupters of my faith! you shall no more</li>
  <li class="number">Be stomachers to my heart. Thus may poor fools</li>
  <li>Believe false teachers: though those that</li>
  <li>are betray'd</li>
  <li>Do feel the treason sharply, yet the traitor</li>
  <li>Stands in worse case of woe.</li>
  <li class="number">And thou, Posthumus, thou that didst set up</li>
  <li>My disobedience 'gainst the king my father</li>
  <li>And make me put into contempt the suits</li>
  <li>Of princely fellows, shalt hereafter find</li>
  <li>It is no act of common passage, but</li>
  <li class="number">A strain of rareness: and I grieve myself</li>
  <li>To think, when thou shalt be disedged by her</li>
  <li>That now thou tirest on, how thy memory</li>
  <li>Will then be pang'd by me. Prithee, dispatch:</li>
  <li>The lamb entreats the butcher: where's thy knife?</li>
  <li class="number">Thou art too slow to do thy master's bidding,</li>
  <li>When I desire it too.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PISANIO</li>
  <li>O gracious lady,</li>
  <li>Since I received command to do this business</li>
  <li>I have not slept one wink.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IMOGEN</li>
  <li class="number">Do't, and to bed then.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PISANIO</li>
  <li>I'll wake mine eye-balls blind first.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IMOGEN</li>
  <li>Wherefore then</li>
  <li>Didst undertake it? Why hast thou abused</li>
  <li>So many miles with a pretence? this place?</li>
  <li class="number">Mine action and thine own? our horses' labour?</li>
  <li>The time inviting thee? the perturb'd court,</li>
  <li>For my being absent? whereunto I never</li>
  <li>Purpose return. Why hast thou gone so far,</li>
  <li>To be unbent when thou hast ta'en thy stand,</li>
  <li class="number">The elected deer before thee?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PISANIO</li>
  <li>But to win time</li>
  <li>To lose so bad employment; in the which</li>
  <li>I have consider'd of a course. Good lady,</li>
  <li>Hear me with patience.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IMOGEN</li>
  <li class="number">Talk thy tongue weary; speak</li>
  <li>I have heard I am a strumpet; and mine ear</li>
  <li>Therein false struck, can take no greater wound,</li>
  <li>Nor tent to bottom that. But speak.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PISANIO</li>
  <li>Then, madam,</li>
  <li class="number">I thought you would not back again.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IMOGEN</li>
  <li>Most like;</li>
  <li>Bringing me here to kill me.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PISANIO</li>
  <li>Not so, neither:</li>
  <li>But if I were as wise as honest, then</li>
  <li class="number">My purpose would prove well. It cannot be</li>
  <li>But that my master is abused:</li>
  <li>Some villain, ay, and singular in his art.</li>
  <li>Hath done you both this cursed injury.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IMOGEN</li>
  <li>Some Roman courtezan.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PISANIO</li>
  <li class="number">No, on my life.</li>
  <li>I'll give but notice you are dead and send him</li>
  <li>Some bloody sign of it; for 'tis commanded</li>
  <li>I should do so: you shall be miss'd at court,</li>
  <li>And that will well confirm it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IMOGEN</li>
  <li class="number">Why good fellow,</li>
  <li>What shall I do the where? where bide? how live?</li>
  <li>Or in my life what comfort, when I am</li>
  <li>Dead to my husband?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PISANIO</li>
  <li>If you'll back to the court — </li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IMOGEN</li>
  <li class="number">No court, no father; nor no more ado</li>
  <li>With that harsh, noble, simple nothing,</li>
  <li>That Cloten, whose love-suit hath been to me</li>
  <li>As fearful as a siege.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PISANIO</li>
  <li>If not at court,</li>
  <li class="number">Then not in Britain must you bide.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IMOGEN</li>
  <li>Where then</li>
  <li>Hath Britain all the sun that shines? Day, night,</li>
  <li>Are they not but in Britain? I' the world's volume</li>
  <li>Our Britain seems as of it, but not in 't;</li>
  <li class="number">In a great pool a swan's nest: prithee, think</li>
  <li>There's livers out of Britain.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PISANIO</li>
  <li>I am most glad</li>
  <li>You think of other place. The ambassador,</li>
  <li>Lucius the Roman, comes to Milford-Haven</li>
  <li class="number">To-morrow: now, if you could wear a mind</li>
  <li>Dark as your fortune is, and but disguise</li>
  <li>That which, to appear itself, must not yet be</li>
  <li>But by self-danger, you should tread a course</li>
  <li>Pretty and full of view; yea, haply, near</li>
  <li class="number">The residence of Posthumus; so nigh at least</li>
  <li>That though his actions were not visible, yet</li>
  <li>Report should render him hourly to your ear</li>
  <li>As truly as he moves.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IMOGEN</li>
  <li>O, for such means!</li>
  <li class="number">Though peril to my modesty, not death on't,</li>
  <li>I would adventure.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PISANIO</li>
  <li>Well, then, here's the point:</li>
  <li>You must forget to be a woman; change</li>
  <li>Command into obedience: fear and niceness — </li>
  <li class="number">The handmaids of all women, or, more truly,</li>
  <li>Woman its pretty self — into a waggish courage:</li>
  <li>Ready in gibes, quick-answer'd, saucy and</li>
  <li>As quarrelous as the weasel; nay, you must</li>
  <li>Forget that rarest treasure of your cheek,</li>
  <li class="number">Exposing it — but, O, the harder heart!</li>
  <li>Alack, no remedy! — to the greedy touch</li>
  <li>Of common-kissing Titan, and forget</li>
  <li>Your laboursome and dainty trims, wherein</li>
  <li>You made great Juno angry.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IMOGEN</li>
  <li class="number">Nay, be brief</li>
  <li>I see into thy end, and am almost</li>
  <li>A man already.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PISANIO</li>
  <li>First, make yourself but like one.</li>
  <li>Fore-thinking this, I have already fit — </li>
  <li class="number">'Tis in my cloak-bag — doublet, hat, hose, all</li>
  <li>That answer to them: would you in their serving,</li>
  <li>And with what imitation you can borrow</li>
  <li>From youth of such a season, 'fore noble Lucius</li>
  <li>Present yourself, desire his service, tell him</li>
  <li class="number">wherein you're happy —  which you'll make him know,</li>
  <li>If that his head have ear in music —  doubtless</li>
  <li>With joy he will embrace you, for he's honourable</li>
  <li>And doubling that, most holy. Your means abroad,</li>
  <li>You have me, rich; and I will never fail</li>
  <li class="number">Beginning nor supplyment.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">IMOGEN</li>
  <li>Thou art all the comfort</li>
  <li>The gods will diet me with. Prithee, away:</li>
  <li>There's more to be consider'd; but we'll even</li>
  <li>All that good time will give us: this attempt</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PISANIO</li>
  <li>Well, madam, we must take a short farewell,</li>
  <li>Lest, being miss'd, I be suspected of</li>
  <li>Your carriage from the court. My noble mistress,</li>
  <li class="number">Here is a box; I had it from the queen:</li>
  <li>What's in't is precious; if you are sick at sea,</li>

  <li class="speaker">CAIUS LUCIUS</li>
  <li>Thanks, royal sir.</li>
  <li>My emperor hath wrote, I must from hence;</li>

  <li class="number">My master's enemy.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CYMBELINE</li>
  <li>Our subjects, sir,</li>
  <li>Will not endure his yoke; and for ourself</li>
  <li>To show less sovereignty than they, must needs</li>
  <li>Appear unkinglike.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAIUS LUCIUS</li>
  <li class="number">So, sir: I desire of you</li>
  <li>A conduct over-land to Milford-Haven.</li>
  <li>Madam, all joy befal your grace!</li>

  <li class="speaker">QUEEN</li>

  <li class="speaker">CYMBELINE</li>
  <li>My lords, you are appointed for that office;</li>

  <li>So farewell, noble Lucius.</li>

  <li class="speaker">CAIUS LUCIUS</li>
  <li>Your hand, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CLOTEN</li>
  <li>Receive it friendly; but from this time forth</li>
  <li>I wear it as your enemy.</li>

  <li class="number">Sir, the event</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CYMBELINE</li>
  <li>Leave not the worthy Lucius, good my lords,</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt LUCIUS and Lords</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">QUEEN</li>
  <li>He goes hence frowning: but it honours us</li>

  <li class="speaker">CYMBELINE</li>
  <li>Lucius hath wrote already to the emperor</li>
  <li>How it goes here. It fits us therefore ripely</li>
  <li class="number">Our chariots and our horsemen be in readiness:</li>
  <li>The powers that he already hath in Gallia</li>
  <li>Will soon be drawn to head, from whence he moves</li>
  <li>His war for Britain.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">QUEEN</li>
  <li>'Tis not sleepy business;</li>
  <li class="number">But must be look'd to speedily and strongly.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CYMBELINE</li>
  <li>Our expectation that it would be thus</li>
  <li>Hath made us forward. But, my gentle queen,</li>
  <li>Where is our daughter? She hath not appear'd</li>
  <li>Before the Roman, nor to us hath tender'd</li>
  <li class="number">The duty of the day: she looks us like</li>
  <li>A thing more made of malice than of duty:</li>
  <li>We have noted it. Call her before us; for</li>
  <li>We have been too slight in sufferance.</li>

  <li>Royal sir,</li>
  <li class="number">Since the exile of Posthumus, most retired</li>
  <li>Hath her life been; the cure whereof, my lord,</li>
  <li>'Tis time must do. Beseech your majesty,</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Re-enter Attendant</div>

  <li>Please you, sir,</li>
  <li>Her chambers are all lock'd; and there's no answer</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">QUEEN</li>
  <li>My lord, when last I went to visit her,</li>
  <li>She pray'd me to excuse her keeping close,</li>
  <li>Whereto constrain'd by her infirmity,</li>
  <li>She should that duty leave unpaid to you,</li>
  <li class="number">Which daily she was bound to proffer: this</li>
  <li>She wish'd me to make known; but our great court</li>
  <li>Made me to blame in memory.</li>

  <li>Where is she gone? Haply, despair hath seized her,</li>
  <li class="number">Or, wing'd with fervor of her love, she's flown</li>
  <li>To her desired Posthumus: gone she is</li>

  <li>And but the backs of Britons seen, all flying</li>
  <li>Through a straight lane; the enemy full-hearted,</li>
  <li class="number">Lolling the tongue with slaughtering, having work</li>

  <li>Excited me to treason: their dear loss,</li>
  <li class="number">The more of you 'twas felt, the more it shaped</li>
  <li>Unto my end of stealing them. But, gracious sir,</li>

  <li>peace and plenty.'</li>
  <li>Thou, Leonatus, art the lion's whelp;</li>
  <li>The fit and apt construction of thy name,</li>
  <li>Being Leonatus, doth import so much.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">To CYMBELINE</li>
  <li class="number">The piece of tender air, thy virtuous daughter,</li>
  <li>Which we call 'mollis aer;' and 'mollis aer'</li>
  <li>We term it 'mulier:' which 'mulier' I divine</li>
  <li>Is this most constant wife; who, even now,</li>
  <li>Answering the letter of the oracle,</li>
  <li class="number">Unknown to you, unsought, were clipp'd about</li>
  <li>With this most tender air.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CYMBELINE</li>
  <li>This hath some seeming.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Soothsayer</li>
  <li>The lofty cedar, royal Cymbeline,</li>
  <li>Personates thee: and thy lopp'd branches point</li>
  <li class="number">Thy two sons forth; who, by Belarius stol'n,</li>
  <li>For many years thought dead, are now revived,</li>
  <li>To the majestic cedar join'd, whose issue</li>
  <li>Promises Britain peace and plenty.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CYMBELINE</li>
  <li>Well</li>
  <li class="number">My peace we will begin. And, Caius Lucius,</li>
  <li>Although the victor, we submit to Caesar,</li>
  <li>And to the Roman empire; promising</li>
  <li>To pay our wonted tribute, from the which</li>
  <li>We were dissuaded by our wicked queen;</li>
  <li class="number">Whom heavens, in justice, both on her and hers,</li>
  <li>Have laid most heavy hand.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Soothsayer</li>
  <li>The fingers of the powers above do tune</li>
  <li>The harmony of this peace. The vision</li>
  <li>Which I made known to Lucius, ere the stroke</li>
  <li class="number">Of this yet scarce-cold battle, at this instant</li>
  <li>Is full accomplish'd; for the Roman eagle,</li>
  <li>From south to west on wing soaring aloft,</li>
  <li>Lessen'd herself, and in the beams o' the sun</li>
  <li>So vanish'd: which foreshow'd our princely eagle,</li>
  <li class="number">The imperial Caesar, should again unite</li>
  <li>His favour with the radiant Cymbeline,</li>
  <li>Which shines here in the west.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CYMBELINE</li>
  <li>Laud we the gods;</li>
  <li>And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils</li>
  <li class="number">From our blest altars. Publish we this peace</li>
  <li>To all our subjects. Set we forward: let</li>
  <li>A Roman and a British ensign wave</li>
  <li>Friendly together: so through Lud's-town march:</li>
  <li>And in the temple of great Jupiter</li>
  <li class="number">Our peace we'll ratify; seal it with feasts.</li>
  <li>Set on there! Never was a war did cease,</li>
  <li>Ere bloody hands were wash'd, with such a peace.</li>
