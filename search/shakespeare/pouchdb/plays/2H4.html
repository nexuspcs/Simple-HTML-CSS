<h3>SCENE I.  The same.</h3>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LORD BARDOLPH</li>
  <li>Who keeps the gate here, ho?</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">The Porter opens the gate</li>
  <li>Where is the earl?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Porter</li>
  <li>What shall I say you are?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LORD BARDOLPH</li>
  <li>Tell thou the earl</li>
  <li class="number">That the Lord Bardolph doth attend him here.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Porter</li>
  <li>His lordship is walk'd forth into the orchard;</li>
  <li>Please it your honour, knock but at the gate,</li>
  <li>And he himself wilt answer.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter NORTHUMBERLAND</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LORD BARDOLPH</li>
  <li>Here comes the earl.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit Porter</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NORTHUMBERLAND</li>
  <li class="number">What news, Lord Bardolph? every minute now</li>
  <li>Should be the father of some stratagem:</li>
  <li>The times are wild: contention, like a horse</li>
  <li>Full of high feeding, madly hath broke loose</li>
  <li>And bears down all before him.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LORD BARDOLPH</li>
  <li class="number">Noble earl,</li>
  <li>I bring you certain news from Shrewsbury.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NORTHUMBERLAND</li>
  <li>Good, an God will!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LORD BARDOLPH</li>
  <li>As good as heart can wish:</li>
  <li>The king is almost wounded to the death;</li>
  <li class="number">And, in the fortune of my lord your son,</li>
  <li>Prince Harry slain outright; and both the Blunts</li>
  <li>Kill'd by the hand of Douglas; young Prince John</li>
  <li>And Westmoreland and Stafford fled the field;</li>
  <li>And Harry Monmouth's brawn, the hulk Sir John,</li>
  <li class="number">Is prisoner to your son: O, such a day,</li>
  <li>So fought, so follow'd and so fairly won,</li>
  <li>Came not till now to dignify the times,</li>
  <li>Since Caesar's fortunes!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NORTHUMBERLAND</li>
  <li>How is this derived?</li>
  <li class="number">Saw you the field? came you from Shrewsbury?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LORD BARDOLPH</li>
  <li>I spake with one, my lord, that came from thence,</li>
  <li>A gentleman well bred and of good name,</li>
  <li>That freely render'd me these news for true.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NORTHUMBERLAND</li>
  <li>Here comes my servant Travers, whom I sent</li>
  <li class="number">On Tuesday last to listen after news.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter TRAVERS</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LORD BARDOLPH</li>
  <li>My lord, I over-rode him on the way;</li>
  <li>And he is furnish'd with no certainties</li>
  <li>More than he haply may retail from me.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NORTHUMBERLAND</li>
  <li>Now, Travers, what good tidings comes with you?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TRAVERS</li>
  <li class="number">My lord, Sir John Umfrevile turn'd me back</li>
  <li>With joyful tidings; and, being better horsed,</li>
  <li>Out-rode me. After him came spurring hard</li>
  <li>A gentleman, almost forspent with speed,</li>
  <li>That stopp'd by me to breathe his bloodied horse.</li>
  <li class="number">He ask'd the way to Chester; and of him</li>
  <li>I did demand what news from Shrewsbury:</li>
  <li>He told me that rebellion had bad luck</li>
  <li>And that young Harry Percy's spur was cold.</li>
  <li>With that, he gave his able horse the head,</li>
  <li class="number">And bending forward struck his armed heels</li>
  <li>Against the panting sides of his poor jade</li>
  <li>Up to the rowel-head, and starting so</li>
  <li>He seem'd in running to devour the way,</li>
  <li>Staying no longer question.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NORTHUMBERLAND</li>
  <li class="number">Ha! Again:</li>
  <li>Said he young Harry Percy's spur was cold?</li>
  <li>Of Hotspur Coldspur? that rebellion</li>
  <li>Had met ill luck?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LORD BARDOLPH</li>
  <li>My lord, I'll tell you what;</li>
  <li class="number">If my young lord your son have not the day,</li>
  <li>Upon mine honour, for a silken point</li>
  <li>I'll give my barony: never talk of it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NORTHUMBERLAND</li>
  <li>Why should that gentleman that rode by Travers</li>
  <li>Give then such instances of loss?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LORD BARDOLPH</li>
  <li class="number">Who, he?</li>
  <li>He was some hilding fellow that had stolen</li>
  <li>The horse he rode on, and, upon my life,</li>
  <li>Spoke at a venture. Look, here comes more news.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter MORTON</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NORTHUMBERLAND</li>
  <li>Yea, this man's brow, like to a title-leaf,</li>
  <li class="number">Foretells the nature of a tragic volume:</li>
  <li>So looks the strand whereon the imperious flood</li>
  <li>Hath left a witness'd usurpation.</li>
  <li>Say, Morton, didst thou come from Shrewsbury?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MORTON</li>
  <li>I ran from Shrewsbury, my noble lord;</li>
  <li class="number">Where hateful death put on his ugliest mask</li>
  <li>To fright our party.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NORTHUMBERLAND</li>
  <li>How doth my son and brother?</li>
  <li>Thou tremblest; and the whiteness in thy cheek</li>
  <li>Is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand.</li>
  <li class="number">Even such a man, so faint, so spiritless,</li>
  <li>So dull, so dead in look, so woe-begone,</li>
  <li>Drew Priam's curtain in the dead of night,</li>
  <li>And would have told him half his Troy was burnt;</li>
  <li>But Priam found the fire ere he his tongue,</li>
  <li class="number">And I my Percy's death ere thou report'st it.</li>
  <li>This thou wouldst say, 'Your son did thus and thus;</li>
  <li>Your brother thus: so fought the noble Douglas:'</li>
  <li>Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds:</li>
  <li>But in the end, to stop my ear indeed,</li>
  <li class="number">Thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise,</li>
  <li>Ending with 'Brother, son, and all are dead.'</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MORTON</li>
  <li>Douglas is living, and your brother, yet;</li>
  <li>But, for my lord your son — </li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NORTHUMBERLAND</li>
  <li>Why, he is dead.</li>
  <li class="number">See what a ready tongue suspicion hath!</li>
  <li>He that but fears the thing he would not know</li>
  <li>Hath by instinct knowledge from others' eyes</li>
  <li>That what he fear'd is chanced. Yet speak, Morton;</li>
  <li>Tell thou an earl his divination lies,</li>
  <li class="number">And I will take it as a sweet disgrace</li>
  <li>And make thee rich for doing me such wrong.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MORTON</li>
  <li>You are too great to be by me gainsaid:</li>
  <li>Your spirit is too true, your fears too certain.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NORTHUMBERLAND</li>
  <li>Yet, for all this, say not that Percy's dead.</li>
  <li class="number">I see a strange confession in thine eye:</li>
  <li>Thou shakest thy head and hold'st it fear or sin</li>
  <li>To speak a truth. If he be slain, say so;</li>
  <li>The tongue offends not that reports his death:</li>
  <li>And he doth sin that doth belie the dead,</li>
  <li class="number">Not he which says the dead is not alive.</li>
  <li>Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news</li>
  <li>Hath but a losing office, and his tongue</li>
  <li>Sounds ever after as a sullen bell,</li>
  <li>Remember'd tolling a departing friend.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LORD BARDOLPH</li>
  <li class="number">I cannot think, my lord, your son is dead.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MORTON</li>
  <li>I am sorry I should force you to believe</li>
  <li>That which I would to God I had not seen;</li>
  <li>But these mine eyes saw him in bloody state,</li>
  <li>Rendering faint quittance, wearied and out-breathed,</li>
  <li class="number">To Harry Monmouth; whose swift wrath beat down</li>
  <li>The never-daunted Percy to the earth,</li>
  <li>From whence with life he never more sprung up.</li>
  <li>In few, his death, whose spirit lent a fire</li>
  <li>Even to the dullest peasant in his camp,</li>
  <li class="number">Being bruited once, took fire and heat away</li>
  <li>From the best temper'd courage in his troops;</li>
  <li>For from his metal was his party steel'd;</li>
  <li>Which once in him abated, all the rest</li>
  <li>Turn'd on themselves, like dull and heavy lead:</li>
  <li class="number">And as the thing that's heavy in itself,</li>
  <li>Upon enforcement flies with greatest speed,</li>
  <li>So did our men, heavy in Hotspur's loss,</li>
  <li>Lend to this weight such lightness with their fear</li>
  <li>That arrows fled not swifter toward their aim</li>
  <li class="number">Than did our soldiers, aiming at their safety,</li>
  <li>Fly from the field. Then was the noble Worcester</li>
  <li>Too soon ta'en prisoner; and that furious Scot,</li>
  <li>The bloody Douglas, whose well-labouring sword</li>
  <li>Had three times slain the appearance of the king,</li>
  <li class="number">'Gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame</li>
  <li>Of those that turn'd their backs, and in his flight,</li>
  <li>Stumbling in fear, was took. The sum of all</li>
  <li>Is that the king hath won, and hath sent out</li>
  <li>A speedy power to encounter you, my lord,</li>
  <li class="number">Under the conduct of young Lancaster</li>
  <li>And Westmoreland. This is the news at full.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NORTHUMBERLAND</li>
  <li>For this I shall have time enough to mourn.</li>
  <li>In poison there is physic; and these news,</li>
  <li>Having been well, that would have made me sick,</li>
  <li class="number">Being sick, have in some measure made me well:</li>
  <li>And as the wretch, whose fever-weaken'd joints,</li>
  <li>Like strengthless hinges, buckle under life,</li>
  <li>Impatient of his fit, breaks like a fire</li>
  <li>Out of his keeper's arms, even so my limbs,</li>
  <li class="number">Weaken'd with grief, being now enraged with grief,</li>
  <li>Are thrice themselves. Hence, therefore, thou nice crutch!</li>
  <li>A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel</li>
  <li>Must glove this hand: and hence, thou sickly quoif!</li>
  <li>Thou art a guard too wanton for the head</li>
  <li class="number">Which princes, flesh'd with conquest, aim to hit.</li>
  <li>Now bind my brows with iron; and approach</li>
  <li>The ragged'st hour that time and spite dare bring</li>
  <li>To frown upon the enraged Northumberland!</li>
  <li>Let heaven kiss earth! now let not Nature's hand</li>
  <li class="number">Keep the wild flood confined! let order die!</li>
  <li>And let this world no longer be a stage</li>
  <li>To feed contention in a lingering act;</li>
  <li>But let one spirit of the first-born Cain</li>
  <li>Reign in all bosoms, that, each heart being set</li>
  <li class="number">On bloody courses, the rude scene may end,</li>
  <li>And darkness be the burier of the dead!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TRAVERS</li>
  <li>This strained passion doth you wrong, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LORD BARDOLPH</li>
  <li>Sweet earl, divorce not wisdom from your honour.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MORTON</li>
  <li>The lives of all your loving complices</li>
  <li class="number">Lean on your health; the which, if you give o'er</li>
  <li>To stormy passion, must perforce decay.</li>
  <li>You cast the event of war, my noble lord,</li>
  <li>And summ'd the account of chance, before you said</li>
  <li>'Let us make head.' It was your presurmise,</li>
  <li class="number">That, in the dole of blows, your son might drop:</li>
  <li>You knew he walk'd o'er perils, on an edge,</li>
  <li>More likely to fall in than to get o'er;</li>
  <li>You were advised his flesh was capable</li>
  <li>Of wounds and scars and that his forward spirit</li>
  <li class="number">Would lift him where most trade of danger ranged:</li>
  <li>Yet did you say 'Go forth;' and none of this,</li>
  <li>Though strongly apprehended, could restrain</li>
  <li>The stiff-borne action: what hath then befallen,</li>
  <li>Or what hath this bold enterprise brought forth,</li>
  <li class="number">More than that being which was like to be?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LORD BARDOLPH</li>
  <li>We all that are engaged to this loss</li>
  <li>Knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas</li>
  <li>That if we wrought our life 'twas ten to one;</li>
  <li>And yet we ventured, for the gain proposed</li>
  <li class="number">Choked the respect of likely peril fear'd;</li>
  <li>And since we are o'erset, venture again.</li>
  <li>Come, we will all put forth, body and goods.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MORTON</li>
  <li>'Tis more than time: and, my most noble lord,</li>
  <li>I hear for certain, and do speak the truth,</li>
  <li class="number">The gentle Archbishop of York is up</li>
  <li>With well-appointed powers: he is a man</li>
  <li>Who with a double surety binds his followers.</li>
  <li>My lord your son had only but the corpse,</li>
  <li>But shadows and the shows of men, to fight;</li>
  <li class="number">For that same word, rebellion, did divide</li>
  <li>The action of their bodies from their souls;</li>
  <li>And they did fight with queasiness, constrain'd,</li>
  <li>As men drink potions, that their weapons only</li>
  <li>Seem'd on our side; but, for their spirits and souls,</li>
  <li class="number">This word, rebellion, it had froze them up,</li>
  <li>As fish are in a pond. But now the bishop</li>
  <li>Turns insurrection to religion:</li>
  <li>Supposed sincere and holy in his thoughts,</li>
  <li>He's followed both with body and with mind;</li>
  <li class="number">And doth enlarge his rising with the blood</li>
  <li>Of fair King Richard, scraped from Pomfret stones;</li>
  <li>Derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause;</li>
  <li>Tells them he doth bestride a bleeding land,</li>
  <li>Gasping for life under great Bolingbroke;</li>
  <li class="number">And more and less do flock to follow him.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NORTHUMBERLAND</li>
  <li>I knew of this before; but, to speak truth,</li>
  <li>This present grief had wiped it from my mind.</li>
  <li>Go in with me; and counsel every man</li>
  <li>The aptest way for safety and revenge:</li>
  <li class="number">Get posts and letters, and make friends with speed:</li>
  <li>Never so few, and never yet more need.</li>

<h3>SCENE II.  London. A street.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter FALSTAFF, with his Page bearing his sword
and buckler</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li>Sirrah, you giant, what says the doctor to my water?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Page</li>
  <li>He said, sir, the water itself was a good healthy</li>
  <li>water; but, for the party that owed it, he might</li>
  <li>have more diseases than he knew for.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li class="number">Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me: the</li>
  <li>brain of this foolish-compounded clay, man, is not</li>
  <li>able to invent anything that tends to laughter, more</li>
  <li>than I invent or is invented on me: I am not only</li>
  <li>witty in myself, but the cause that wit is in other</li>
  <li class="number">men. I do here walk before thee like a sow that</li>
  <li>hath overwhelmed all her litter but one. If the</li>
  <li>prince put thee into my service for any other reason</li>
  <li>than to set me off, why then I have no judgment.</li>
  <li>Thou whoreson mandrake, thou art fitter to be worn</li>
  <li class="number">in my cap than to wait at my heels. I was never</li>
  <li>manned with an agate till now: but I will inset you</li>
  <li>neither in gold nor silver, but in vile apparel, and</li>
  <li>send you back again to your master, for a jewel —  </li>
  <li>the juvenal, the prince your master, whose chin is</li>
  <li class="number">not yet fledged. I will sooner have a beard grow in</li>
  <li>the palm of my hand than he shall get one on his</li>
  <li>cheek; and yet he will not stick to say his face is</li>
  <li>a face-royal: God may finish it when he will, 'tis</li>
  <li>not a hair amiss yet: he may keep it still at a</li>
  <li class="number">face-royal, for a barber shall never earn sixpence</li>
  <li>out of it; and yet he'll be crowing as if he had</li>
  <li>writ man ever since his father was a bachelor. He</li>
  <li>may keep his own grace, but he's almost out of mine,</li>
  <li>I can assure him. What said Master Dombledon about</li>
  <li class="number">the satin for my short cloak and my slops?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Page</li>
  <li>He said, sir, you should procure him better</li>
  <li>assurance than Bardolph: he would not take his</li>
  <li>band and yours; he liked not the security.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li>Let him be damned, like the glutton! pray God his</li>
  <li class="number">tongue be hotter! A whoreson Achitophel! a rascally</li>
  <li>yea-forsooth knave! to bear a gentleman in hand,</li>
  <li>and then stand upon security! The whoreson</li>
  <li>smooth-pates do now wear nothing but high shoes, and</li>
  <li>bunches of keys at their girdles; and if a man is</li>
  <li class="number">through with them in honest taking up, then they</li>
  <li>must stand upon security. I had as lief they would</li>
  <li>put ratsbane in my mouth as offer to stop it with</li>
  <li>security. I looked a' should have sent me two and</li>
  <li>twenty yards of satin, as I am a true knight, and he</li>
  <li class="number">sends me security. Well, he may sleep in security;</li>
  <li>for he hath the horn of abundance, and the lightness</li>
  <li>of his wife shines through it: and yet cannot he</li>
  <li>see, though he have his own lanthorn to light him.</li>
  <li>Where's Bardolph?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Page</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li>Why, sir, did I say you were an honest man? setting</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Servant</li>
  <li>I pray you, sir, then set your knighthood and our</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Servant</li>
  <li>Sir, my lord would speak with you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</li>
  <li class="number">Sir John Falstaff, a word with you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li>My good lord! God give your lordship good time of</li>
  <li>day. I am glad to see your lordship abroad: I heard</li>
  <li>say your lordship was sick: I hope your lordship</li>
  <li>goes abroad by advice. Your lordship, though not</li>
  <li class="number">clean past your youth, hath yet some smack of age in</li>
  <li>you, some relish of the saltness of time; and I must</li>
  <li>humbly beseech your lordship to have a reverent care</li>
  <li>of your health.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</li>
  <li>Sir John, I sent for you before your expedition to</li>
  <li class="number">Shrewsbury.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li>An't please your lordship, I hear his majesty is</li>
  <li>returned with some discomfort from Wales.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</li>
  <li>I talk not of his majesty: you would not come when</li>
  <li>I sent for you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li class="number">And I hear, moreover, his highness is fallen into</li>
  <li>this same whoreson apoplexy.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</li>
  <li>Well, God mend him! I pray you, let me speak with</li>
  <li>you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li>This apoplexy is, as I take it, a kind of lethargy,</li>
  <li class="number">an't please your lordship; a kind of sleeping in the</li>
  <li>blood, a whoreson tingling.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</li>
  <li>What tell you me of it? be it as it is.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li>It hath its original from much grief, from study and</li>
  <li>perturbation of the brain: I have read the cause of</li>
  <li class="number">his effects in Galen: it is a kind of deafness.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</li>
  <li>I think you are fallen into the disease; for you</li>
  <li>hear not what I say to you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li>Very well, my lord, very well: rather, an't please</li>
  <li>you, it is the disease of not listening, the malady</li>
  <li class="number">of not marking, that I am troubled withal.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</li>
  <li>To punish you by the heels would amend the</li>
  <li>attention of your ears; and I care not if I do</li>
  <li>become your physician.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li>I am as poor as Job, my lord, but not so patient:</li>
  <li class="number">your lordship may minister the potion of</li>
  <li>imprisonment to me in respect of poverty; but how</li>
  <li>should I be your patient to follow your</li>
  <li>prescriptions, the wise may make some dram of a</li>
  <li>scruple, or indeed a scruple itself.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</li>
  <li class="number">I sent for you, when there were matters against you</li>
  <li>for your life, to come speak with me.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li>As I was then advised by my learned counsel in the</li>
  <li>laws of this land-service, I did not come.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</li>
  <li>Well, the truth is, Sir John, you live in great infamy.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li class="number">He that buckles him in my belt cannot live in less.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</li>
  <li>Your means are very slender, and your waste is great.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li>I would it were otherwise; I would my means were</li>
  <li>greater, and my waist slenderer.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</li>
  <li>You have misled the youthful prince.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li class="number">The young prince hath misled me: I am the fellow</li>
  <li>with the great belly, and he my dog.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</li>
  <li>Well, I am loath to gall a new-healed wound: your</li>
  <li>day's service at Shrewsbury hath a little gilded</li>
  <li>over your night's exploit on Gad's-hill: you may</li>
  <li class="number">thank the unquiet time for your quiet o'er-posting</li>
  <li>that action.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li>My lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</li>
  <li>But since all is well, keep it so: wake not a</li>
  <li>sleeping wolf.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li class="number">To wake a wolf is as bad as to smell a fox.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</li>
  <li>What! you are as a candle, the better part burnt</li>
  <li>out.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li>A wassail candle, my lord, all tallow: if I did say</li>
  <li>of wax, my growth would approve the truth.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</li>
  <li class="number">There is not a white hair on your face but should</li>
  <li>have his effect of gravity.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li>His effect of gravy, gravy, gravy.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</li>
  <li>You follow the young prince up and down, like his</li>
  <li>ill angel.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li class="number">Not so, my lord; your ill angel is light; but I hope</li>
  <li>he that looks upon me will take me without weighing:</li>
  <li>and yet, in some respects, I grant, I cannot go: I</li>
  <li>cannot tell. Virtue is of so little regard in these</li>
  <li>costermonger times that true valour is turned</li>
  <li class="number">bear-herd: pregnancy is made a tapster, and hath</li>
  <li>his quick wit wasted in giving reckonings: all the</li>
  <li>other gifts appertinent to man, as the malice of</li>
  <li>this age shapes them, are not worth a gooseberry.</li>
  <li>You that are old consider not the capacities of us</li>
  <li class="number">that are young; you do measure the heat of our</li>
  <li>livers with the bitterness of your galls: and we</li>
  <li>that are in the vaward of our youth, I must confess,</li>
  <li>are wags too.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</li>
  <li>Do you set down your name in the scroll of youth,</li>
  <li class="number">that are written down old with all the characters of</li>
  <li>age? Have you not a moist eye? a dry hand? a</li>
  <li>yellow cheek? a white beard? a decreasing leg? an</li>
  <li>increasing belly? is not your voice broken? your</li>
  <li>wind short? your chin double? your wit single? and</li>
  <li class="number">every part about you blasted with antiquity? and</li>
  <li>will you yet call yourself young? Fie, fie, fie, Sir John!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li>My lord, I was born about three of the clock in the</li>
  <li>afternoon, with a white head and something a round</li>
  <li>belly. For my voice, I have lost it with halloing</li>
  <li class="number">and singing of anthems. To approve my youth</li>
  <li>further, I will not: the truth is, I am only old in</li>
  <li>judgment and understanding; and he that will caper</li>
  <li>with me for a thousand marks, let him lend me the</li>
  <li>money, and have at him! For the box of the ear that</li>
  <li class="number">the prince gave you, he gave it like a rude prince,</li>
  <li>and you took it like a sensible lord. I have</li>
  <li>chequed him for it, and the young lion repents;</li>
  <li>marry, not in ashes and sackcloth, but in new silk</li>
  <li>and old sack.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</li>
  <li class="number">Well, God send the prince a better companion!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li>God send the companion a better prince! I cannot</li>
  <li>rid my hands of him.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</li>
  <li>Well, the king hath severed you and Prince Harry: I</li>
  <li>hear you are going with Lord John of Lancaster</li>
  <li class="number">against the Archbishop and the Earl of</li>
  <li>Northumberland.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li>Yea; I thank your pretty sweet wit for it. But look</li>
  <li>you pray, all you that kiss my lady Peace at home,</li>
  <li>that our armies join not in a hot day; for, by the</li>
  <li class="number">Lord, I take but two shirts out with me, and I mean</li>
  <li>not to sweat extraordinarily: if it be a hot day,</li>
  <li>and I brandish any thing but a bottle, I would I</li>
  <li>might never spit white again. There is not a</li>
  <li>dangerous action can peep out his head but I am</li>
  <li class="number">thrust upon it: well, I cannot last ever: but it</li>
  <li>was alway yet the trick of our English nation, if</li>
  <li>they have a good thing, to make it too common. If</li>
  <li>ye will needs say I am an old man, you should give</li>
  <li>me rest. I would to God my name were not so</li>
  <li class="number">terrible to the enemy as it is: I were better to be</li>
  <li>eaten to death with a rust than to be scoured to</li>
  <li>nothing with perpetual motion.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</li>
  <li>Well, be honest, be honest; and God bless your</li>
  <li>expedition!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li class="number">Will your lordship lend me a thousand pound to</li>
  <li>furnish me forth?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</li>
  <li>Not a penny, not a penny; you are too impatient to</li>
  <li>bear crosses. Fare you well: commend me to my</li>
  <li>cousin Westmoreland.</li>

<h3>SCENE III.  York. The Archbishop's palace.</h3>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</li>
  <li>Thus have you heard our cause and known our means;</li>
  <li>And, my most noble friends, I pray you all,</li>
  <li>Speak plainly your opinions of our hopes:</li>
  <li>And first, lord marshal, what say you to it?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MOWBRAY</li>
  <li class="number">I well allow the occasion of our arms;</li>
  <li>But gladly would be better satisfied</li>
  <li>How in our means we should advance ourselves</li>
  <li>To look with forehead bold and big enough</li>
  <li>Upon the power and puissance of the king.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HASTINGS</li>
  <li class="number">Our present musters grow upon the file</li>
  <li>To five and twenty thousand men of choice;</li>
  <li>And our supplies live largely in the hope</li>
  <li>Of great Northumberland, whose bosom burns</li>
  <li>With an incensed fire of injuries.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LORD BARDOLPH</li>
  <li class="number">The question then, Lord Hastings, standeth thus;</li>
  <li>Whether our present five and twenty thousand</li>
  <li>May hold up head without Northumberland?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HASTINGS</li>
  <li>With him, we may.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LORD BARDOLPH</li>
  <li>Yea, marry, there's the point:</li>
  <li class="number">But if without him we be thought too feeble,</li>
  <li>My judgment is, we should not step too far</li>
  <li>Till we had his assistance by the hand;</li>
  <li>For in a theme so bloody-faced as this</li>
  <li>Conjecture, expectation, and surmise</li>
  <li class="number">Of aids incertain should not be admitted.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</li>
  <li>'Tis very true, Lord Bardolph; for indeed</li>
  <li>It was young Hotspur's case at Shrewsbury.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LORD BARDOLPH</li>
  <li>It was, my lord; who lined himself with hope,</li>
  <li>Eating the air on promise of supply,</li>
  <li class="number">Flattering himself in project of a power</li>
  <li>Much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts:</li>
  <li>And so, with great imagination</li>
  <li>Proper to madmen, led his powers to death</li>
  <li>And winking leap'd into destruction.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HASTINGS</li>

  <li class="speaker">LORD BARDOLPH</li>
  <li>Yes, if this present quality of war,</li>
  <li>Indeed the instant action: a cause on foot</li>
  <li>Lives so in hope as in an early spring</li>
  <li class="number">We see the appearing buds; which to prove fruit,</li>
  <li>Hope gives not so much warrant as despair</li>
  <li>That frosts will bite them. When we mean to build,</li>
  <li>We first survey the plot, then draw the model;</li>
  <li>And when we see the figure of the house,</li>
  <li class="number">Then must we rate the cost of the erection;</li>
  <li>Which if we find outweighs ability,</li>
  <li>What do we then but draw anew the model</li>
  <li>In fewer offices, or at last desist</li>
  <li>To build at all? Much more, in this great work,</li>
  <li class="number">Which is almost to pluck a kingdom down</li>
  <li>And set another up, should we survey</li>
  <li>The plot of situation and the model,</li>
  <li>Consent upon a sure foundation,</li>
  <li>Question surveyors, know our own estate,</li>
  <li class="number">How able such a work to undergo,</li>
  <li>To weigh against his opposite; or else</li>
  <li>We fortify in paper and in figures,</li>
  <li>Using the names of men instead of men:</li>
  <li>Like one that draws the model of a house</li>
  <li class="number">Beyond his power to build it; who, half through,</li>
  <li>Gives o'er and leaves his part-created cost</li>
  <li>A naked subject to the weeping clouds</li>
  <li>And waste for churlish winter's tyranny.</li>
</ol>

  <li>I think we are a body strong enough,</li>
  <li>Even as we are, to equal with the king.</li>
</ol>

MISTRESS QUICKLY O Lord, ay! good Master Snare.

SNARE Here, here.

FANG Snare, we must arrest Sir John Falstaff.

MISTRESS QUICKLY Yea, good Master Snare; I have entered him and all.

SNARE It may chance cost some of us our lives, for he will stab.

MISTRESS QUICKLY Alas the day! take heed of him; he stabbed me in
mine own house, and that most beastly: in good
faith, he cares not what mischief he does. If his
weapon be out: he will foin like any devil; he will
spare neither man, woman, nor child.

FANG If I can close with him, I care not for his thrust.

MISTRESS QUICKLY No, nor I neither: I'll be at your elbow.

FANG An I but fist him once; an a' come but within my vice —

MISTRESS QUICKLY I am undone by his going; I warrant you, he's an
infinitive thing upon my score. Good Master Fang,
hold him sure: good Master Snare, let him not
'scape. A' comes continuantly to Pie-corner — saving
your manhoods — to buy a saddle; and he is indited to
dinner to the Lubber's-head in Lumbert street, to
Master Smooth's the silkman: I pray ye, since my
exion is entered and my case so openly known to the
world, let him be brought in to his answer. A
hundred mark is a long one for a poor lone woman to
bear: and I have borne, and borne, and borne, and
have been fubbed off, and fubbed off, and fubbed
off, from this day to that day, that it is a shame
to be thought on. There is no honesty in such
dealing; unless a woman should be made an ass and a
beast, to bear every knave's wrong. Yonder he
comes; and that errant malmsey-nose knave, Bardolph,
with him. Do your offices, do your offices: Master
Fang and Master Snare, do me, do me, do me your offices.

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</li>
  <li>Before God, I am exceeding weary.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POINS</li>
  <li>Is't come to that? I had thought weariness durst not</li>
  <li>have attached one of so high blood.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</li>
  <li>Faith, it does me; though it discolours the</li>
  <li class="number">complexion of my greatness to acknowledge it. Doth</li>
  <li>it not show vilely in me to desire small beer?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POINS</li>
  <li>Why, a prince should not be so loosely studied as</li>
  <li>to remember so weak a composition.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</li>
  <li>Belike then my appetite was not princely got; for,</li>
  <li class="number">by my troth, I do now remember the poor creature,</li>
  <li>small beer. But, indeed, these humble</li>
  <li>considerations make me out of love with my</li>
  <li>greatness. What a disgrace is it to me to remember</li>
  <li>thy name! or to know thy face to-morrow! or to</li>
  <li class="number">take note how many pair of silk stockings thou</li>
  <li>hast, viz. these, and those that were thy</li>
  <li>peach-coloured ones! or to bear the inventory of thy</li>
  <li>shirts, as, one for superfluity, and another for</li>
  <li>use! But that the tennis-court-keeper knows better</li>
  <li class="number">than I; for it is a low ebb of linen with thee when</li>
  <li>thou keepest not racket there; as thou hast not done</li>
  <li>a great while, because the rest of thy low</li>
  <li>countries have made a shift to eat up thy holland:</li>
  <li>and God knows, whether those that bawl out the ruins</li>
  <li class="number">of thy linen shall inherit his kingdom: but the</li>
  <li>midwives say the children are not in the fault;</li>
  <li>whereupon the world increases, and kindreds are</li>
  <li>mightily strengthened.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POINS</li>
  <li>How ill it follows, after you have laboured so hard,</li>
  <li class="number">you should talk so idly! Tell me, how many good</li>
  <li>young princes would do so, their fathers being so</li>
  <li>sick as yours at this time is?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</li>
  <li>Shall I tell thee one thing, Poins?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POINS</li>
  <li>Yes, faith; and let it be an excellent good thing.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</li>
  <li class="number">It shall serve among wits of no higher breeding than thine.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POINS</li>
  <li>Go to; I stand the push of your one thing that you</li>
  <li>will tell.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</li>
  <li>Marry, I tell thee, it is not meet that I should be</li>
  <li>sad, now my father is sick: albeit I could tell</li>
  <li class="number">thee, as to one it pleases me, for fault of a</li>
  <li>better, to call my friend, I could be sad, and sad</li>
  <li>indeed too.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POINS</li>
  <li>Very hardly upon such a subject.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</li>
  <li>By this hand thou thinkest me as far in the devil's</li>
  <li class="number">book as thou and Falstaff for obduracy and</li>
  <li>persistency: let the end try the man. But I tell</li>
  <li>thee, my heart bleeds inwardly that my father is so</li>
  <li>sick: and keeping such vile company as thou art</li>
  <li>hath in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POINS</li>
  <li class="number">The reason?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</li>
  <li>What wouldst thou think of me, if I should weep?</li>

  <li class="speaker">POINS</li>
  <li>I would think thee a most princely hypocrite.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</li>
  <li>It would be every man's thought; and thou art a</li>
  <li>blessed fellow to think as every man thinks: never</li>
  <li class="number">a man's thought in the world keeps the road-way</li>
  <li>better than thine: every man would think me an</li>
  <li>hypocrite indeed. And what accites your most</li>
  <li>worshipful thought to think so?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POINS</li>
  <li>Why, because you have been so lewd and so much</li>

  <li>Into the sea! and, other times, to see</li>
  <li class="number">The beachy girdle of the ocean</li>
  <li>Too wide for Neptune's hips; how chances mock,</li>

  <li>The happiest youth, viewing his progress through,</li>
  <li class="number">What perils past, what crosses to ensue,</li>
  <li>Would shut the book, and sit him down and die.</li>
  <li>'Tis not 'ten years gone</li>
  <li>Since Richard and Northumberland, great friends,</li>
  <li>Did feast together, and in two years after</li>
  <li class="number">Were they at wars: it is but eight years since</li>
  <li>This Percy was the man nearest my soul,</li>

  <li>And laid his love and life under my foot,</li>
  <li>Yea, for my sake, even to the eyes of Richard</li>
  <li class="number">Gave him defiance. But which of you was by — </li>
  <li>You, cousin Nevil, as I may remember — </li>
  <li class="stage-direction">To WARWICK</li>
  <li>When Richard, with his eye brimful of tears,</li>

  <li class="number">'The time shall come,' thus did he follow it,</li>
  <li>'The time will come, that foul sin, gathering head,</li>

  <li class="number">Indeed, sir, to my cost.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SHALLOW</li>
  <li>A' must, then, to the inns o' court shortly. I was</li>

  <li>I may say to you, we knew where the bona-robas were</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SHALLOW</li>
  <li class="number">It is well said, in faith, sir; and it is well said</li>

  <li>but I will maintain the word with my sword to be a</li>
  <li>soldier-like word, and a word of exceeding good</li>
  <li>command, by heaven. Accommodated; that is, when a</li>
  <li class="number">man is, as they say, accommodated; or when a man is,</li>
  <li>being, whereby a' may be thought to be accommodated;</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MOULDY</li>
  <li>I was pricked well enough before, an you could have</li>
  <li>let me alone: my old dame will be undone now for</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li>You may: but if he had been a man's tailor, he'ld</li>

  <li>discharge you with the motion of a pewterer's</li>
  <li class="number">hammer, come off and on swifter than he that gibbets</li>

  <li>level at the edge of a penknife. And for a retreat;</li>
  <li class="number">how swiftly will this Feeble the woman's tailor run</li>

  <li>would manage you his piece thus; and a' would about</li>

  <li class="stage-direction">Exeunt BARDOLPH, Recruits, etc.</li>
  <li>As I return, I will fetch off these justices: I do</li>
  <li>see the bottom of Justice Shallow. Lord, Lord, how</li>
  <li>subject we old men are to this vice of lying! This</li>
  <li>same starved justice hath done nothing but prate to</li>
  <li class="number">me of the wildness of his youth, and the feats he</li>
  <li>hath done about Turnbull Street: and every third</li>
  <li>word a lie, duer paid to the hearer than the Turk's</li>
  <li>tribute. I do remember him at Clement's Inn like a</li>
  <li>man made after supper of a cheese-paring: when a'</li>
  <li class="number">was naked, he was, for all the world, like a forked</li>
  <li>radish, with a head fantastically carved upon it</li>
  <li>with a knife: a' was so forlorn, that his</li>
  <li>dimensions to any thick sight were invincible: a'</li>
  <li>was the very genius of famine; yet lecherous as a</li>
  <li class="number">monkey, and the whores called him mandrake: a' came</li>
  <li>ever in the rearward of the fashion, and sung those</li>
  <li>tunes to the overscutched huswives that he heard the</li>
  <li>carmen whistle, and swear they were his fancies or</li>
  <li>his good-nights. And now is this Vice's dagger</li>
  <li class="number">become a squire, and talks as familiarly of John a</li>
  <li>Gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him; and</li>
  <li>I'll be sworn a' ne'er saw him but once in the</li>
  <li>Tilt-yard; and then he burst his head for crowding</li>
  <li>among the marshal's men. I saw it, and told John a</li>
  <li class="number">Gaunt he beat his own name; for you might have</li>
  <li>thrust him and all his apparel into an eel-skin; the</li>
  <li>case of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him, a</li>
  <li>court: and now has he land and beefs. Well, I'll</li>
  <li>be acquainted with him, if I return; and it shall</li>
  <li class="number">go hard but I will make him a philosopher's two</li>
  <li>stones to me: if the young dace be a bait for the</li>
  <li>old pike, I see no reason in the law of nature but I</li>
  <li>may snap at him. Let time shape, and there an end.</li>

  <li>New-dated letters from Northumberland;</li>
  <li class="number">Their cold intent, tenor and substance, thus:</li>
  <li>Here doth he wish his person, with such powers</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter WESTMORELAND</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MOWBRAY</li>
  <li>I think it is my Lord of Westmoreland.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WESTMORELAND</li>
  <li>Health and fair greeting from our general,</li>
  <li class="number">The prince, Lord John and Duke of Lancaster.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</li>
  <li>Say on, my Lord of Westmoreland, in peace:</li>
  <li>What doth concern your coming?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WESTMORELAND</li>
  <li>Then, my lord,</li>
  <li>Unto your grace do I in chief address</li>
  <li class="number">The substance of my speech. If that rebellion</li>
  <li>Came like itself, in base and abject routs,</li>
  <li>Led on by bloody youth, guarded with rags,</li>
  <li>And countenanced by boys and beggary,</li>
  <li>I say, if damn'd commotion so appear'd,</li>
  <li class="number">In his true, native and most proper shape,</li>
  <li>You, reverend father, and these noble lords</li>
  <li>Had not been here, to dress the ugly form</li>
  <li>Of base and bloody insurrection</li>
  <li>With your fair honours. You, lord archbishop,</li>
  <li class="number">Whose see is by a civil peace maintained,</li>
  <li>Whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touch'd,</li>
  <li>Whose learning and good letters peace hath tutor'd,</li>
  <li>Whose white investments figure innocence,</li>
  <li>The dove and very blessed spirit of peace,</li>
  <li class="number">Wherefore do you so ill translate ourself</li>
  <li>Out of the speech of peace that bears such grace,</li>
  <li>Into the harsh and boisterous tongue of war;</li>
  <li>Turning your books to graves, your ink to blood,</li>
  <li>Your pens to lances and your tongue divine</li>
  <li class="number">To a trumpet and a point of war?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</li>
  <li>Wherefore do I this? so the question stands.</li>
  <li>Briefly to this end: we are all diseased,</li>
  <li>And with our surfeiting and wanton hours</li>
  <li>Have brought ourselves into a burning fever,</li>
  <li class="number">And we must bleed for it; of which disease</li>
  <li>Our late king, Richard, being infected, died.</li>
  <li>But, my most noble Lord of Westmoreland,</li>
  <li>I take not on me here as a physician,</li>
  <li>Nor do I as an enemy to peace</li>
  <li class="number">Troop in the throngs of military men;</li>
  <li>But rather show awhile like fearful war,</li>
  <li>To diet rank minds sick of happiness</li>
  <li>And purge the obstructions which begin to stop</li>
  <li>Our very veins of life. Hear me more plainly.</li>
  <li class="number">I have in equal balance justly weigh'd</li>
  <li>What wrongs our arms may do, what wrongs we suffer,</li>
  <li>And find our griefs heavier than our offences.</li>
  <li>We see which way the stream of time doth run,</li>
  <li>And are enforced from our most quiet there</li>
  <li class="number">By the rough torrent of occasion;</li>
  <li>And have the summary of all our griefs,</li>
  <li>When time shall serve, to show in articles;</li>
  <li>Which long ere this we offer'd to the king,</li>
  <li>And might by no suit gain our audience:</li>
  <li class="number">When we are wrong'd and would unfold our griefs,</li>
  <li>We are denied access unto his person</li>
  <li>Even by those men that most have done us wrong.</li>
  <li>The dangers of the days but newly gone,</li>
  <li>Whose memory is written on the earth</li>
  <li class="number">With yet appearing blood, and the examples</li>
  <li>Of every minute's instance, present now,</li>
  <li>Hath put us in these ill-beseeming arms,</li>
  <li>Not to break peace or any branch of it,</li>
  <li>But to establish here a peace indeed,</li>
  <li class="number">Concurring both in name and quality.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WESTMORELAND</li>
  <li>When ever yet was your appeal denied?</li>
  <li>Wherein have you been galled by the king?</li>
  <li>What peer hath been suborn'd to grate on you,</li>
  <li>That you should seal this lawless bloody book</li>
  <li class="number">Of forged rebellion with a seal divine</li>
  <li>And consecrate commotion's bitter edge?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</li>
  <li>My brother general, the commonwealth,</li>
  <li>To brother born an household cruelty,</li>
  <li>I make my quarrel in particular.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WESTMORELAND</li>
  <li class="number">There is no need of any such redress;</li>
  <li>Or if there were, it not belongs to you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MOWBRAY</li>
  <li>Why not to him in part, and to us all</li>
  <li>That feel the bruises of the days before,</li>
  <li>And suffer the condition of these times</li>
  <li class="number">To lay a heavy and unequal hand</li>
  <li>Upon our honours?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WESTMORELAND</li>
  <li>O, my good Lord Mowbray,</li>
  <li>Construe the times to their necessities,</li>
  <li>And you shall say indeed, it is the time,</li>
  <li class="number">And not the king, that doth you injuries.</li>
  <li>Yet for your part, it not appears to me</li>
  <li>Either from the king or in the present time</li>
  <li>That you should have an inch of any ground</li>
  <li>To build a grief on: were you not restored</li>
  <li class="number">To all the Duke of Norfolk's signories,</li>
  <li>Your noble and right well remember'd father's?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MOWBRAY</li>
  <li>What thing, in honour, had my father lost,</li>
  <li>That need to be revived and breathed in me?</li>
  <li>The king that loved him, as the state stood then,</li>
  <li class="number">Was force perforce compell'd to banish him:</li>
  <li>And then that Harry Bolingbroke and he,</li>
  <li>Being mounted and both roused in their seats,</li>
  <li>Their neighing coursers daring of the spur,</li>
  <li>Their armed staves in charge, their beavers down,</li>
  <li class="number">Their eyes of fire sparking through sights of steel</li>
  <li>And the loud trumpet blowing them together,</li>
  <li>Then, then, when there was nothing could have stay'd</li>
  <li>My father from the breast of Bolingbroke,</li>
  <li>O when the king did throw his warder down,</li>
  <li class="number">His own life hung upon the staff he threw;</li>
  <li>Then threw he down himself and all their lives</li>
  <li>That by indictment and by dint of sword</li>
  <li>Have since miscarried under Bolingbroke.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WESTMORELAND</li>
  <li>You speak, Lord Mowbray, now you know not what.</li>
  <li class="number">The Earl of Hereford was reputed then</li>
  <li>In England the most valiant gentlemen:</li>
  <li>Who knows on whom fortune would then have smiled?</li>
  <li>But if your father had been victor there,</li>
  <li>He ne'er had borne it out of Coventry:</li>
  <li class="number">For all the country in a general voice</li>
  <li>Cried hate upon him; and all their prayers and love</li>
  <li>Were set on Hereford, whom they doted on</li>
  <li>And bless'd and graced indeed, more than the king.</li>
  <li>But this is mere digression from my purpose.</li>
  <li class="number">Here come I from our princely general</li>
  <li>To know your griefs; to tell you from his grace</li>
  <li>That he will give you audience; and wherein</li>
  <li>It shall appear that your demands are just,</li>
  <li>You shall enjoy them, every thing set off</li>
  <li class="number">That might so much as think you enemies.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MOWBRAY</li>
  <li>But he hath forced us to compel this offer;</li>
  <li>And it proceeds from policy, not love.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WESTMORELAND</li>
  <li>Mowbray, you overween to take it so;</li>
  <li>This offer comes from mercy, not from fear:</li>
  <li class="number">For, lo! within a ken our army lies,</li>
  <li>Upon mine honour, all too confident</li>
  <li>To give admittance to a thought of fear.</li>
  <li>Our battle is more full of names than yours,</li>
  <li>Our men more perfect in the use of arms,</li>
  <li class="number">Our armour all as strong, our cause the best;</li>
  <li>Then reason will our heart should be as good</li>
  <li>Say you not then our offer is compell'd.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MOWBRAY</li>
  <li>Well, by my will we shall admit no parley.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WESTMORELAND</li>
  <li>That argues but the shame of your offence:</li>
  <li class="number">A rotten case abides no handling.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HASTINGS</li>
  <li>Hath the Prince John a full commission,</li>
  <li>In very ample virtue of his father,</li>
  <li>To hear and absolutely to determine</li>
  <li>Of what conditions we shall stand upon?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WESTMORELAND</li>
  <li class="number">That is intended in the general's name:</li>
  <li>I muse you make so slight a question.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</li>
  <li>Then take, my Lord of Westmoreland, this schedule,</li>
  <li>For this contains our general grievances:</li>
  <li>Each several article herein redress'd,</li>
  <li class="number">All members of our cause, both here and hence,</li>
  <li>That are insinew'd to this action,</li>
  <li>Acquitted by a true substantial form</li>
  <li>And present execution of our wills</li>
  <li>To us and to our purposes confined,</li>
  <li class="number">We come within our awful banks again</li>
  <li>And knit our powers to the arm of peace.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WESTMORELAND</li>
  <li>This will I show the general. Please you, lords,</li>
  <li>In sight of both our battles we may meet;</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MOWBRAY</li>
  <li>Yea, but our valuation shall be such</li>
  <li class="number">That every slight and false-derived cause,</li>
  <li>Yea, every idle, nice and wanton reason</li>
  <li>Shall to the king taste of this action;</li>

  <li>We shall be winnow'd with so rough a wind</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</li>
  <li>No, no, my lord. Note this; the king is weary</li>
  <li>Of dainty and such picking grievances:</li>
  <li>For he hath found to end one doubt by death</li>
  <li class="number">Revives two greater in the heirs of life,</li>
  <li>And therefore will he wipe his tables clean</li>
  <li>And keep no tell-tale to his memory</li>
  <li>That may repeat and history his loss</li>
  <li>To new remembrance; for full well he knows</li>
  <li class="number">He cannot so precisely weed this land</li>
  <li>As his misdoubts present occasion:</li>
  <li>His foes are so enrooted with his friends</li>
  <li>That, plucking to unfix an enemy,</li>
  <li>He doth unfasten so and shake a friend:</li>
  <li class="number">So that this land, like an offensive wife</li>
  <li>That hath enraged him on to offer strokes,</li>
  <li>As he is striking, holds his infant up</li>
  <li>And hangs resolved correction in the arm</li>
  <li>That was uprear'd to execution.</li>

the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, HASTINGS, and others: from
the other side, Prince John of LANCASTER, and
WESTMORELAND; Officers, and others with them</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LANCASTER</li>
  <li>You are well encounter'd here, my cousin Mowbray:</li>
  <li>Good day to you, gentle lord archbishop;</li>
  <li>And so to you, Lord Hastings, and to all.</li>
  <li>My Lord of York, it better show'd with you</li>
  <li class="number">When that your flock, assembled by the bell,</li>
  <li>Encircled you to hear with reverence</li>
  <li>Your exposition on the holy text</li>
  <li>Than now to see you here an iron man,</li>
  <li>Cheering a rout of rebels with your drum,</li>
  <li class="number">Turning the word to sword and life to death.</li>
  <li>That man that sits within a monarch's heart,</li>
  <li>And ripens in the sunshine of his favour,</li>
  <li>Would he abuse the countenance of the king,</li>
  <li>Alack, what mischiefs might he set abrooch</li>
  <li class="number">In shadow of such greatness! With you, lord bishop,</li>
  <li>It is even so. Who hath not heard it spoken</li>
  <li>How deep you were within the books of God?</li>
  <li>To us the speaker in his parliament;</li>
  <li>To us the imagined voice of God himself;</li>
  <li class="number">The very opener and intelligencer</li>
  <li>Between the grace, the sanctities of heaven</li>
  <li>And our dull workings. O, who shall believe</li>
  <li>But you misuse the reverence of your place,</li>
  <li>Employ the countenance and grace of heaven,</li>
  <li class="number">As a false favourite doth his prince's name,</li>
  <li>In deeds dishonourable? You have ta'en up,</li>
  <li>Under the counterfeited zeal of God,</li>
  <li>The subjects of his substitute, my father,</li>
  <li>And both against the peace of heaven and him</li>
  <li class="number">Have here up-swarm'd them.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</li>
  <li>Good my Lord of Lancaster,</li>
  <li>I am not here against your father's peace;</li>

  <li>The time misorder'd doth, in common sense,</li>
  <li class="number">Crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form,</li>
  <li>To hold our safety up. I sent your grace</li>
  <li>The parcels and particulars of our grief,</li>
  <li>The which hath been with scorn shoved from the court,</li>
  <li>Whereon this Hydra son of war is born;</li>
  <li class="number">Whose dangerous eyes may well be charm'd asleep</li>
  <li>With grant of our most just and right desires,</li>

  <li>And though we here fall down,</li>

  <li>And so success of mischief shall be born</li>
  <li class="number">And heir from heir shall hold this quarrel up</li>
  <li>Whiles England shall have generation.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LANCASTER</li>

  <li>I like them all, and do allow them well,</li>

  <li>My father's purposes have been mistook,</li>
  <li>And some about him have too lavishly</li>
  <li class="number">Wrested his meaning and authority.</li>
  <li>My lord, these griefs shall be with speed redress'd;</li>
  <li>Upon my soul, they shall. If this may please you,</li>
  <li>Discharge your powers unto their several counties,</li>
  <li>As we will ours: and here between the armies</li>
  <li class="number">Let's drink together friendly and embrace,</li>

  <li>your dukedom. Good faith, this same young sober-</li>
  <li>blooded boy doth not love me; nor a man cannot make</li>
  <li>him laugh; but that's no marvel, he drinks no wine.</li>
  <li>There's never none of these demure boys come to any</li>
  <li class="number">proof; for thin drink doth so over-cool their blood,</li>
  <li>and making many fish-meals, that they fall into a</li>
  <li>kind of male green-sickness; and then when they</li>
  <li>marry, they get wenches: they are generally fools</li>
  <li>and cowards; which some of us should be too, but for</li>
  <li class="number">inflammation. A good sherris sack hath a two-fold</li>
  <li>operation in it. It ascends me into the brain;</li>
  <li>dries me there all the foolish and dull and curdy</li>
  <li>vapours which environ it; makes it apprehensive,</li>
  <li>quick, forgetive, full of nimble fiery and</li>
  <li class="number">delectable shapes, which, delivered o'er to the</li>
  <li>voice, the tongue, which is the birth, becomes</li>
  <li>excellent wit. The second property of your</li>
  <li>excellent sherris is, the warming of the blood;</li>
  <li>which, before cold and settled, left the liver</li>
  <li class="number">white and pale, which is the badge of pusillanimity</li>
  <li>and cowardice; but the sherris warms it and makes</li>
  <li>it course from the inwards to the parts extreme:</li>
  <li>it illumineth the face, which as a beacon gives</li>
  <li>warning to all the rest of this little kingdom,</li>
  <li class="number">man, to arm; and then the vital commoners and</li>
  <li>inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain,</li>
  <li>the heart, who, great and puffed up with this</li>
  <li>retinue, doth any deed of courage; and this valour</li>
  <li>comes of sherris. So that skill in the weapon is</li>
  <li class="number">nothing without sack, for that sets it a-work; and</li>
  <li>learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil, till</li>
  <li>sack commences it and sets it in act and use.</li>
  <li>Hereof comes it that Prince Harry is valiant; for</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING HENRY IV</li>
  <li>Now, lords, if God doth give successful end</li>
  <li>To this debate that bleedeth at our doors,</li>
  <li>We will our youth lead on to higher fields</li>
  <li>And draw no swords but what are sanctified.</li>
  <li class="number">Our navy is address'd, our power collected,</li>
  <li>Our substitutes in absence well invested,</li>
  <li>And every thing lies level to our wish:</li>
  <li>Only, we want a little personal strength;</li>
  <li>And pause us, till these rebels, now afoot,</li>
  <li class="number">Come underneath the yoke of government.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WARWICK</li>
  <li>Both which we doubt not but your majesty</li>
  <li>Shall soon enjoy.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING HENRY IV</li>
  <li>Humphrey, my son of Gloucester,</li>
  <li>Where is the prince your brother?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li class="number">I think he's gone to hunt, my lord, at Windsor.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING HENRY IV</li>
  <li>And how accompanied?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>I do not know, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING HENRY IV</li>
  <li>Is not his brother, Thomas of Clarence, with him?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>No, my good lord; he is in presence here.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CLARENCE</li>
  <li class="number">What would my lord and father?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING HENRY IV</li>
  <li>Nothing but well to thee, Thomas of Clarence.</li>
  <li>How chance thou art not with the prince thy brother?</li>
  <li>He loves thee, and thou dost neglect him, Thomas;</li>
  <li>Thou hast a better place in his affection</li>
  <li class="number">Than all thy brothers: cherish it, my boy,</li>
  <li>And noble offices thou mayst effect</li>
  <li>Of mediation, after I am dead,</li>
  <li>Between his greatness and thy other brethren:</li>
  <li>Therefore omit him not; blunt not his love,</li>
  <li class="number">Nor lose the good advantage of his grace</li>
  <li>By seeming cold or careless of his will;</li>
  <li>For he is gracious, if he be observed:</li>
  <li>He hath a tear for pity and a hand</li>
  <li>Open as day for melting charity:</li>
  <li class="number">Yet notwithstanding, being incensed, he's flint,</li>
  <li>As humorous as winter and as sudden</li>
  <li>As flaws congealed in the spring of day.</li>
  <li>His temper, therefore, must be well observed:</li>
  <li>Chide him for faults, and do it reverently,</li>
  <li class="number">When thou perceive his blood inclined to mirth;</li>
  <li>But, being moody, give him line and scope,</li>
  <li>Till that his passions, like a whale on ground,</li>
  <li>Confound themselves with working. Learn this, Thomas,</li>
  <li>And thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends,</li>
  <li class="number">A hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in,</li>
  <li>That the united vessel of their blood,</li>
  <li>Mingled with venom of suggestion — </li>
  <li>As, force perforce, the age will pour it in — </li>
  <li>Shall never leak, though it do work as strong</li>
  <li class="number">As aconitum or rash gunpowder.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CLARENCE</li>
  <li>I shall observe him with all care and love.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING HENRY IV</li>
  <li>Why art thou not at Windsor with him, Thomas?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CLARENCE</li>
  <li>He is not there to-day; he dines in London.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">

  <li>And how accompanied? canst thou tell that?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING HENRY IV</li>
  <li>Most subject is the fattest soil to weeds;</li>
  <li>And he, the noble image of my youth,</li>
  <li>Is overspread with them: therefore my grief</li>
  <li>Stretches itself beyond the hour of death:</li>
  <li class="number">The blood weeps from my heart when I do shape</li>
  <li>In forms imaginary the unguided days</li>
  <li>And rotten times that you shall look upon</li>
  <li>When I am sleeping with my ancestors.</li>
  <li>For when his headstrong riot hath no curb,</li>
  <li class="number">When rage and hot blood are his counsellors,</li>
  <li>When means and lavish manners meet together,</li>
  <li>O, with what wings shall his affections fly</li>
  <li>Towards fronting peril and opposed decay!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WARWICK</li>
  <li>My gracious lord, you look beyond him quite:</li>
  <li class="number">The prince but studies his companions</li>
  <li>Like a strange tongue, wherein, to gain the language,</li>
  <li>'Tis needful that the most immodest word</li>
  <li>Be look'd upon and learn'd; which once attain'd,</li>
  <li>Your highness knows, comes to no further use</li>
  <li class="number">But to be known and hated. So, like gross terms,</li>
  <li>The prince will in the perfectness of time</li>
  <li>Cast off his followers; and their memory</li>
  <li>Shall as a pattern or a measure live,</li>
  <li>By which his grace must mete the lives of others,</li>
  <li class="number">Turning past evils to advantages.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING HENRY IV</li>
  <li>And wherefore should these good news make me sick?</li>
  <li>Will fortune never come with both hands full,</li>
  <li>But write her fair words still in foulest letters?</li>
  <li>She either gives a stomach and no food;</li>
  <li class="number">Such are the poor, in health; or else a feast</li>
  <li>And takes away the stomach; such are the rich,</li>
  <li>That have abundance and enjoy it not.</li>
  <li>I should rejoice now at this happy news;</li>
  <li>And now my sight fails, and my brain is giddy:</li>
  <li class="number">O me! come near me; now I am much ill.</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CLARENCE</li>
  <li>No, no, he cannot long hold out these pangs:</li>
  <li>The incessant care and labour of his mind</li>
  <li>Hath wrought the mure that should confine it in</li>
  <li class="number">So thin that life looks through and will break out.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</li>
  <li>The people fear me; for they do observe</li>
  <li>Unfather'd heirs and loathly births of nature:</li>
  <li>The seasons change their manners, as the year</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CLARENCE</li>
  <li class="number">The river hath thrice flow'd, no ebb between;</li>

  <li class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</li>
  <li>O, pardon me, my liege! but for my tears,</li>

  <li>Let me no more from this obedience rise,</li>
  <li class="number">Which my most inward true and duteous spirit</li>
  <li>Teacheth, this prostrate and exterior bending.</li>
  <li>God witness with me, when I here came in,</li>
  <li>And found no course of breath within your majesty,</li>
  <li>How cold it struck my heart! If I do feign,</li>
  <li class="number">O, let me in my present wildness die</li>
  <li>And never live to show the incredulous world</li>
  <li>The noble change that I have purposed!</li>
  <li>Coming to look on you, thinking you dead,</li>
  <li>And dead almost, my liege, to think you were,</li>
  <li class="number">I spake unto this crown as having sense,</li>
  <li>And thus upbraided it: 'The care on thee depending</li>
  <li>Hath fed upon the body of my father;</li>
  <li>Therefore, thou best of gold art worst of gold:</li>
  <li>Other, less fine in carat, is more precious,</li>
  <li class="number">Preserving life in medicine potable;</li>
  <li>But thou, most fine, most honour'd: most renown'd,</li>
  <li>Hast eat thy bearer up.' Thus, my most royal liege,</li>
  <li>Accusing it, I put it on my head,</li>
  <li>To try with it, as with an enemy</li>
  <li class="number">That had before my face murder'd my father,</li>

  <li class="speaker">KING HENRY IV</li>
  <li class="number">O my son,</li>
  <li>God put it in thy mind to take it hence,</li>
  <li>That thou mightst win the more thy father's love,</li>
  <li>Pleading so wisely in excuse of it!</li>
  <li>Come hither, Harry, sit thou by my bed;</li>
  <li class="number">And hear, I think, the very latest counsel</li>
  <li>That ever I shall breathe. God knows, my son,</li>
  <li>By what by-paths and indirect crook'd ways</li>
  <li>I met this crown; and I myself know well</li>
  <li>How troublesome it sat upon my head.</li>
  <li class="number">To thee it shall descend with bitter quiet,</li>
  <li>Better opinion, better confirmation;</li>
  <li>For all the soil of the achievement goes</li>
  <li>With me into the earth. It seem'd in me</li>
  <li>But as an honour snatch'd with boisterous hand,</li>
  <li class="number">And I had many living to upbraid</li>
  <li>My gain of it by their assistances;</li>
  <li>Which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed,</li>
  <li>Wounding supposed peace: all these bold fears</li>
  <li>Thou see'st with peril I have answered;</li>
  <li class="number">For all my reign hath been but as a scene</li>
  <li>Acting that argument: and now my death</li>
  <li>Changes the mode; for what in me was purchased,</li>
  <li>Falls upon thee in a more fairer sort;</li>
  <li>So thou the garland wear'st successively.</li>
  <li class="number">Yet, though thou stand'st more sure than I could do,</li>
  <li>Thou art not firm enough, since griefs are green;</li>
  <li>And all my friends, which thou must make thy friends,</li>
  <li>Have but their stings and teeth newly ta'en out;</li>
  <li>By whose fell working I was first advanced</li>
  <li class="number">And by whose power I well might lodge a fear</li>
  <li>To be again displaced: which to avoid,</li>
  <li>I cut them off; and had a purpose now</li>
  <li>To lead out many to the Holy Land,</li>
  <li>Lest rest and lying still might make them look</li>
  <li class="number">Too near unto my state. Therefore, my Harry,</li>
  <li>Be it thy course to busy giddy minds</li>
  <li>With foreign quarrels; that action, hence borne out,</li>
  <li>May waste the memory of the former days.</li>
  <li>More would I, but my lungs are wasted so</li>
  <li class="number">That strength of speech is utterly denied me.</li>
  <li>How I came by the crown, O God forgive;</li>
  <li>And grant it may with thee in true peace live!</li>

  <li>I grant your worship that he is a knave, sir; but</li>
  <li>yet, God forbid, sir, but a knave should have some</li>

  <li class="number">If I were sawed into quantities, I should make four</li>

  <li>they, by observing of him, do bear themselves like</li>

  <li>imputation of being near their master: if to his</li>
  <li>men, I would curry with Master Shallow that no man</li>
  <li>could better command his servants. It is certain</li>
  <li>that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is</li>
  <li class="number">caught, as men take diseases, one of another:</li>
  <li>therefore let men take heed of their company. I</li>
  <li>will devise matter enough out of this Shallow to</li>
  <li>keep Prince Harry in continual laughter the wearing</li>
  <li>out of six fashions, which is four terms, or two</li>
  <li class="number">actions, and a' shall laugh without intervallums. O,</li>
  <li>it is much that a lie with a slight oath and a jest</li>
  <li>with a sad brow will do with a fellow that never</li>

  <li>The majesty and power of law and justice,</li>
  <li class="number">The image of the king whom I presented,</li>

  <li>Be now the father and propose a son,</li>
  <li>Hear your own dignity so much profaned,</li>
  <li class="number">See your most dreadful laws so loosely slighted,</li>

  <li>Till you do live to see a son of mine</li>

  <li>So shall I live to speak my father's words:</li>
  <li>'Happy am I, that have a man so bold,</li>
  <li class="number">That dares do justice on my proper son;</li>
  <li>And not less happy, having such a son,</li>
  <li>That would deliver up his greatness so</li>
  <li>Into the hands of justice.' You did commit me:</li>
  <li>For which, I do commit into your hand</li>
  <li class="number">The unstained sword that you have used to bear;</li>
  <li>With this remembrance, that you use the same</li>
  <li>With the like bold, just and impartial spirit</li>
  <li>As you have done 'gainst me. There is my hand.</li>
  <li>You shall be as a father to my youth:</li>
  <li class="number">My voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear,</li>
  <li>And I will stoop and humble my intents</li>
  <li>To your well-practised wise directions.</li>
  <li>And, princes all, believe me, I beseech you;</li>
  <li>My father is gone wild into his grave,</li>
  <li class="number">For in his tomb lie my affections;</li>
  <li>And with his spirit sadly I survive,</li>
  <li>To mock the expectation of the world,</li>
  <li>To frustrate prophecies and to raze out</li>
  <li>Rotten opinion, who hath writ me down</li>
  <li class="number">After my seeming. The tide of blood in me</li>
  <li>Hath proudly flow'd in vanity till now:</li>
  <li>Now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea,</li>
  <li>Where it shall mingle with the state of floods</li>
  <li>And flow henceforth in formal majesty.</li>
  <li class="number">Now call we our high court of parliament:</li>
  <li>And let us choose such limbs of noble counsel,</li>
  <li>That the great body of our state may go</li>
  <li>In equal rank with the best govern'd nation;</li>
  <li>That war, or peace, or both at once, may be</li>
  <li class="number">As things acquainted and familiar to us;</li>
  <li>In which you, father, shall have foremost hand.</li>
  <li>Our coronation done, we will accite,</li>
