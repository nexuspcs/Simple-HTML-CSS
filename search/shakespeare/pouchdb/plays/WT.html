<section class="scene">

<h3>SCENE I.  Antechamber in LEONTES' palace.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter CAMILLO and ARCHIDAMUS</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ARCHIDAMUS</li>
  <li>If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia, on</li>
  <li>the like occasion whereon my services are now on</li>
  <li>foot, you shall see, as I have said, great</li>
  <li>difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAMILLO</li>
  <li class="number">I think, this coming summer, the King of Sicilia</li>
  <li>means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ARCHIDAMUS</li>
  <li>Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be</li>
  <li>justified in our loves; for indeed — </li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAMILLO</li>
  <li>Beseech you —  </li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ARCHIDAMUS</li>
  <li class="number">Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge:</li>
  <li>we cannot with such magnificence — in so rare — I know</li>
  <li>not what to say. We will give you sleepy drinks,</li>
  <li>that your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience,</li>
  <li>may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuse</li>
  <li class="number">us.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAMILLO</li>
  <li>You pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ARCHIDAMUS</li>
  <li>Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs me</li>
  <li>and as mine honesty puts it to utterance.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAMILLO</li>
  <li>Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.</li>
  <li class="number">They were trained together in their childhoods; and</li>
  <li>there rooted betwixt them then such an affection,</li>
  <li>which cannot choose but branch now. Since their</li>
  <li>more mature dignities and royal necessities made</li>
  <li>separation of their society, their encounters,</li>
  <li class="number">though not personal, have been royally attorneyed</li>
  <li>with interchange of gifts, letters, loving</li>
  <li>embassies; that they have seemed to be together,</li>
  <li>though absent, shook hands, as over a vast, and</li>
  <li>embraced, as it were, from the ends of opposed</li>
  <li class="number">winds. The heavens continue their loves!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ARCHIDAMUS</li>
  <li>I think there is not in the world either malice or</li>
  <li>matter to alter it. You have an unspeakable</li>
  <li>comfort of your young prince Mamillius: it is a</li>
  <li>gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came</li>
  <li class="number">into my note.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAMILLO</li>
  <li>I very well agree with you in the hopes of him: it</li>
  <li>is a gallant child; one that indeed physics the</li>
  <li>subject, makes old hearts fresh: they that went on</li>
  <li>crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to</li>
  <li class="number">see him a man.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ARCHIDAMUS</li>
  <li>Would they else be content to die?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAMILLO</li>
  <li>Yes; if there were no other excuse why they should</li>
  <li>desire to live.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ARCHIDAMUS</li>
  <li>If the king had no son, they would desire to live</li>
  <li class="number">on crutches till he had one.</li>

<h3>SCENE II.  A room of state in the same.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter LEONTES, HERMIONE, MAMILLIUS,
POLIXENES, CAMILLO, and Attendants</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POLIXENES</li>
  <li>Nine changes of the watery star hath been</li>
  <li>The shepherd's note since we have left our throne</li>
  <li>Without a burthen: time as long again</li>
  <li>Would be find up, my brother, with our thanks;</li>
  <li class="number">And yet we should, for perpetuity,</li>
  <li>Go hence in debt: and therefore, like a cipher,</li>
  <li>Yet standing in rich place, I multiply</li>
  <li>With one 'We thank you' many thousands moe</li>
  <li>That go before it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LEONTES</li>
  <li class="number">Stay your thanks a while;</li>
  <li>And pay them when you part.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POLIXENES</li>
  <li>Sir, that's to-morrow.</li>
  <li>I am question'd by my fears, of what may chance</li>
  <li>Or breed upon our absence; that may blow</li>
  <li class="number">No sneaping winds at home, to make us say</li>
  <li>'This is put forth too truly:' besides, I have stay'd</li>
  <li>To tire your royalty.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LEONTES</li>
  <li>We are tougher, brother,</li>
  <li>Than you can put us to't.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POLIXENES</li>
  <li class="number">No longer stay.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LEONTES</li>
  <li>One seven-night longer.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POLIXENES</li>
  <li>Very sooth, to-morrow.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LEONTES</li>
  <li>We'll part the time between's then; and in that</li>
  <li>I'll no gainsaying.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POLIXENES</li>
  <li class="number">Press me not, beseech you, so.</li>
  <li>There is no tongue that moves, none, none i' the world,</li>
  <li>So soon as yours could win me: so it should now,</li>
  <li>Were there necessity in your request, although</li>
  <li>'Twere needful I denied it. My affairs</li>
  <li class="number">Do even drag me homeward: which to hinder</li>
  <li>Were in your love a whip to me; my stay</li>
  <li>To you a charge and trouble: to save both,</li>
  <li>Farewell, our brother.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LEONTES</li>
  <li>Tongue-tied, our queen?</li>
  <li class="number">speak you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HERMIONE</li>
  <li>I had thought, sir, to have held my peace until</li>
  <li>You have drawn oaths from him not to stay. You, sir,</li>
  <li>Charge him too coldly. Tell him, you are sure</li>
  <li>All in Bohemia's well; this satisfaction</li>
  <li class="number">The by-gone day proclaim'd: say this to him,</li>
  <li>He's beat from his best ward.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LEONTES</li>
  <li>Well said, Hermione.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HERMIONE</li>
  <li>To tell, he longs to see his son, were strong:</li>
  <li>But let him say so then, and let him go;</li>
  <li class="number">But let him swear so, and he shall not stay,</li>
  <li>We'll thwack him hence with distaffs.</li>
  <li>Yet of your royal presence I'll adventure</li>
  <li>The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia</li>
  <li>You take my lord, I'll give him my commission</li>
  <li class="number">To let him there a month behind the gest</li>
  <li>Prefix'd for's parting: yet, good deed, Leontes,</li>
  <li>I love thee not a jar o' the clock behind</li>
  <li>What lady-she her lord. You'll stay?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POLIXENES</li>
  <li>No, madam.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HERMIONE</li>
  <li class="number">Nay, but you will?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POLIXENES</li>
  <li>I may not, verily.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HERMIONE</li>
  <li>Verily!</li>
  <li>You put me off with limber vows; but I,</li>
  <li>Though you would seek to unsphere the</li>
  <li class="number">stars with oaths,</li>
  <li>Should yet say 'Sir, no going.' Verily,</li>
  <li>You shall not go: a lady's 'Verily' 's</li>
  <li>As potent as a lord's. Will you go yet?</li>
  <li>Force me to keep you as a prisoner,</li>
  <li class="number">Not like a guest; so you shall pay your fees</li>
  <li>When you depart, and save your thanks. How say you?</li>
  <li>My prisoner? or my guest? by your dread 'Verily,'</li>
  <li>One of them you shall be.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POLIXENES</li>
  <li>Your guest, then, madam:</li>
  <li class="number">To be your prisoner should import offending;</li>
  <li>Which is for me less easy to commit</li>
  <li>Than you to punish.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HERMIONE</li>
  <li>Not your gaoler, then,</li>
  <li>But your kind hostess. Come, I'll question you</li>
  <li class="number">Of my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys:</li>
  <li>You were pretty lordings then?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POLIXENES</li>
  <li>We were, fair queen,</li>
  <li>Two lads that thought there was no more behind</li>
  <li>But such a day to-morrow as to-day,</li>
  <li class="number">And to be boy eternal.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HERMIONE</li>
  <li>Was not my lord</li>
  <li>The verier wag o' the two?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POLIXENES</li>
  <li>We were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i' the sun,</li>
  <li>And bleat the one at the other: what we changed</li>
  <li class="number">Was innocence for innocence; we knew not</li>
  <li>The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream'd</li>
  <li>That any did. Had we pursued that life,</li>
  <li>And our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd</li>
  <li>With stronger blood, we should have answer'd heaven</li>
  <li class="number">Boldly 'not guilty;' the imposition clear'd</li>
  <li>Hereditary ours.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HERMIONE</li>
  <li>By this we gather</li>
  <li>You have tripp'd since.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POLIXENES</li>
  <li>O my most sacred lady!</li>
  <li class="number">Temptations have since then been born to's; for</li>
  <li>In those unfledged days was my wife a girl;</li>
  <li>Your precious self had then not cross'd the eyes</li>
  <li>Of my young play-fellow.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HERMIONE</li>
  <li>Grace to boot!</li>
  <li class="number">Of this make no conclusion, lest you say</li>
  <li>Your queen and I are devils: yet go on;</li>
  <li>The offences we have made you do we'll answer,</li>
  <li>If you first sinn'd with us and that with us</li>
  <li>You did continue fault and that you slipp'd not</li>
  <li class="number">With any but with us.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LEONTES</li>
  <li>Is he won yet?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HERMIONE</li>
  <li>He'll stay my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LEONTES</li>
  <li>At my request he would not.</li>
  <li>Hermione, my dearest, thou never spokest</li>
  <li class="number">To better purpose.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HERMIONE</li>
  <li>Never?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LEONTES</li>
  <li>Never, but once.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HERMIONE</li>
  <li>What! have I twice said well? when was't before?</li>
  <li>I prithee tell me; cram's with praise, and make's</li>
  <li class="number">As fat as tame things: one good deed dying tongueless</li>
  <li>Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.</li>
  <li>Our praises are our wages: you may ride's</li>
  <li>With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere</li>
  <li>With spur we beat an acre. But to the goal:</li>
  <li class="number">My last good deed was to entreat his stay:</li>
  <li>What was my first? it has an elder sister,</li>
  <li>Or I mistake you: O, would her name were Grace!</li>
  <li>But once before I spoke to the purpose: when?</li>
  <li>Nay, let me have't; I long.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LEONTES</li>
  <li class="number">Why, that was when</li>
  <li>Three crabbed months had sour'd themselves to death,</li>
  <li>Ere I could make thee open thy white hand</li>
  <li>And clap thyself my love: then didst thou utter</li>
  <li>'I am yours for ever.'</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HERMIONE</li>
  <li class="number">'Tis grace indeed.</li>
  <li>Why, lo you now, I have spoke to the purpose twice:</li>
  <li>The one for ever earn'd a royal husband;</li>
  <li>The other for some while a friend.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LEONTES</li>
  <li>Aside Too hot, too hot!</li>
  <li class="number">To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods.</li>
  <li>I have tremor cordis on me: my heart dances;</li>
  <li>But not for joy; not joy. This entertainment</li>
  <li>May a free face put on, derive a liberty</li>
  <li>From heartiness, from bounty, fertile bosom,</li>
  <li class="number">And well become the agent; 't may, I grant;</li>
  <li>But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers,</li>
  <li>As now they are, and making practised smiles,</li>
  <li>As in a looking-glass, and then to sigh, as 'twere</li>
  <li>The mort o' the deer; O, that is entertainment</li>
  <li class="number">My bosom likes not, nor my brows! Mamillius,</li>
  <li>Art thou my boy?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MAMILLIUS</li>
  <li>Ay, my good lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LEONTES</li>
  <li>I' fecks!</li>
  <li>Why, that's my bawcock. What, hast</li>
  <li class="number">smutch'd thy nose?</li>
  <li>They say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain,</li>
  <li>We must be neat; not neat, but cleanly, captain:</li>
  <li>And yet the steer, the heifer and the calf</li>
  <li>Are all call'd neat. — Still virginalling</li>
  <li class="number">Upon his palm! — How now, you wanton calf!</li>
  <li>Art thou my calf?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MAMILLIUS</li>
  <li>Yes, if you will, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LEONTES</li>
  <li>Thou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that I have,</li>
  <li>To be full like me: yet they say we are</li>
  <li class="number">Almost as like as eggs; women say so,</li>
  <li>That will say anything but were they false</li>
  <li>As o'er-dyed blacks, as wind, as waters, false</li>
  <li>As dice are to be wish'd by one that fixes</li>
  <li>No bourn 'twixt his and mine, yet were it true</li>
  <li class="number">To say this boy were like me. Come, sir page,</li>
  <li>Look on me with your welkin eye: sweet villain!</li>
  <li>Most dear'st! my collop! Can thy dam? — may't be? — </li>
  <li>Affection! thy intention stabs the centre:</li>
  <li>Thou dost make possible things not so held,</li>
  <li class="number">Communicatest with dreams; — how can this be? — </li>
  <li>With what's unreal thou coactive art,</li>
  <li>And fellow'st nothing: then 'tis very credent</li>
  <li>Thou mayst co-join with something; and thou dost,</li>
  <li>And that beyond commission, and I find it,</li>
  <li class="number">And that to the infection of my brains</li>
  <li>And hardening of my brows.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POLIXENES</li>
  <li>What means Sicilia?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HERMIONE</li>
  <li>He something seems unsettled.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POLIXENES</li>
  <li>How, my lord!</li>
  <li class="number">What cheer? how is't with you, best brother?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HERMIONE</li>
  <li>You look as if you held a brow of much distraction</li>
  <li>Are you moved, my lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LEONTES</li>
  <li>No, in good earnest.</li>
  <li>How sometimes nature will betray its folly,</li>
  <li class="number">Its tenderness, and make itself a pastime</li>
  <li>To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines</li>
  <li>Of my boy's face, methoughts I did recoil</li>
  <li>Twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech'd,</li>
  <li>In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled,</li>
  <li class="number">Lest it should bite its master, and so prove,</li>
  <li>As ornaments oft do, too dangerous:</li>
  <li>How like, methought, I then was to this kernel,</li>
  <li>This squash, this gentleman. Mine honest friend,</li>
  <li>Will you take eggs for money?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MAMILLIUS</li>
  <li class="number">No, my lord, I'll fight.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LEONTES</li>
  <li>You will! why, happy man be's dole! My brother,</li>
  <li>Are you so fond of your young prince as we</li>
  <li>Do seem to be of ours?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POLIXENES</li>
  <li>If at home, sir,</li>
  <li class="number">He's all my exercise, my mirth, my matter,</li>
  <li>Now my sworn friend and then mine enemy,</li>
  <li>My parasite, my soldier, statesman, all:</li>
  <li>He makes a July's day short as December,</li>
  <li>And with his varying childness cures in me</li>
  <li class="number">Thoughts that would thick my blood.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LEONTES</li>
  <li>So stands this squire</li>

  <li>And leave you to your graver steps. Hermione,</li>
  <li>How thou lovest us, show in our brother's welcome;</li>
  <li class="number">Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap:</li>
  <li>Next to thyself and my young rover, he's</li>
  <li>Apparent to my heart.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HERMIONE</li>
  <li>If you would seek us,</li>
  <li>We are yours i' the garden: shall's attend you there?</li>

  <li>Go, play, boy, play: thy mother plays, and I</li>
  <li>Play too, but so disgraced a part, whose issue</li>
  <li>Will hiss me to my grave: contempt and clamour</li>
  <li>Will be my knell. Go, play, boy, play.</li>
  <li class="number">There have been,</li>
  <li>Or I am much deceived, cuckolds ere now;</li>
  <li>And many a man there is, even at this present,</li>

  <li>That little thinks she has been sluiced in's absence</li>
  <li class="number">And his pond fish'd by his next neighbour, by</li>
  <li>Sir Smile, his neighbour: nay, there's comfort in't</li>
  <li>Whiles other men have gates and those gates open'd,</li>
  <li>As mine, against their will. Should all despair</li>
  <li>That have revolted wives, the tenth of mankind</li>
  <li class="number">Would hang themselves. Physic for't there is none;</li>
  <li>It is a bawdy planet, that will strike</li>

  <li>No barricado for a belly; know't;</li>
  <li class="number">It will let in and out the enemy</li>

  <li>Go play, Mamillius; thou'rt an honest man.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Exit MAMILLIUS</li>
  <li>Camillo, this great sir will yet stay longer.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAMILLO</li>
  <li>You had much ado to make his anchor hold:</li>
  <li>When you cast out, it still came home.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LEONTES</li>
  <li class="number">Didst note it?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAMILLO</li>
  <li>He would not stay at your petitions: made</li>
  <li>His business more material.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LEONTES</li>
  <li>Didst perceive it?</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Aside</li>
  <li>They're here with me already, whispering, rounding</li>
  <li class="number">'Sicilia is a so-forth:' 'tis far gone,</li>
  <li>When I shall gust it last. How came't, Camillo,</li>
  <li>That he did stay?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAMILLO</li>
  <li>At the good queen's entreaty.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LEONTES</li>
  <li>At the queen's be't: 'good' should be pertinent</li>
  <li class="number">But, so it is, it is not. Was this taken</li>
  <li>By any understanding pate but thine?</li>
  <li>For thy conceit is soaking, will draw in</li>
  <li>More than the common blocks: not noted, is't,</li>
  <li>But of the finer natures? by some severals</li>
  <li class="number">Of head-piece extraordinary? lower messes</li>
  <li>Perchance are to this business purblind? say.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAMILLO</li>
  <li>Business, my lord! I think most understand</li>
  <li>Bohemia stays here longer.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LEONTES</li>
  <li>Ha!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAMILLO</li>
  <li class="number">Stays here longer.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LEONTES</li>
  <li>Ay, but why?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAMILLO</li>
  <li>To satisfy your highness and the entreaties</li>
  <li>Of our most gracious mistress.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LEONTES</li>
  <li>Satisfy!</li>
  <li class="number">The entreaties of your mistress! satisfy!</li>
  <li>Let that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo,</li>
  <li>With all the nearest things to my heart, as well</li>
  <li>My chamber-councils, wherein, priest-like, thou</li>
  <li>Hast cleansed my bosom, I from thee departed</li>
  <li class="number">Thy penitent reform'd: but we have been</li>
  <li>Deceived in thy integrity, deceived</li>
  <li>In that which seems so.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAMILLO</li>
  <li>Be it forbid, my lord!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LEONTES</li>
  <li>To bide upon't, thou art not honest, or,</li>
  <li class="number">If thou inclinest that way, thou art a coward,</li>
  <li>Which hoxes honesty behind, restraining</li>
  <li>From course required; or else thou must be counted</li>
  <li>A servant grafted in my serious trust</li>
  <li>And therein negligent; or else a fool</li>
  <li class="number">That seest a game play'd home, the rich stake drawn,</li>
  <li>And takest it all for jest.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAMILLO</li>
  <li>My gracious lord,</li>
  <li>I may be negligent, foolish and fearful;</li>
  <li>In every one of these no man is free,</li>
  <li class="number">But that his negligence, his folly, fear,</li>
  <li>Among the infinite doings of the world,</li>
  <li>Sometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord,</li>
  <li>If ever I were wilful-negligent,</li>
  <li>It was my folly; if industriously</li>
  <li class="number">I play'd the fool, it was my negligence,</li>
  <li>Not weighing well the end; if ever fearful</li>
  <li>To do a thing, where I the issue doubted,</li>
  <li>Where of the execution did cry out</li>
  <li>Against the non-performance, 'twas a fear</li>
  <li class="number">Which oft infects the wisest: these, my lord,</li>
  <li>Are such allow'd infirmities that honesty</li>
  <li>Is never free of. But, beseech your grace,</li>
  <li>Be plainer with me; let me know my trespass</li>
  <li>By its own visage: if I then deny it,</li>
  <li class="number">'Tis none of mine.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LEONTES</li>
  <li>Ha' not you seen, Camillo —  </li>
  <li>But that's past doubt, you have, or your eye-glass</li>
  <li>Is thicker than a cuckold's horn —  or heard —  </li>
  <li>For to a vision so apparent rumour</li>
  <li class="number">Cannot be mute —  or thought —  for cogitation</li>
  <li>Resides not in that man that does not think —  </li>
  <li>My wife is slippery? If thou wilt confess,</li>
  <li>Or else be impudently negative,</li>
  <li>To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought, then say</li>
  <li class="number">My wife's a hobby-horse, deserves a name</li>
  <li>As rank as any flax-wench that puts to</li>
  <li>Before her troth-plight: say't and justify't.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAMILLO</li>
  <li>I would not be a stander-by to hear</li>
  <li>My sovereign mistress clouded so, without</li>
  <li class="number">My present vengeance taken: 'shrew my heart,</li>
  <li>You never spoke what did become you less</li>
  <li>Than this; which to reiterate were sin</li>
  <li>As deep as that, though true.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LEONTES</li>
  <li>Is whispering nothing?</li>
  <li class="number">Is leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses?</li>
  <li>Kissing with inside lip? stopping the career</li>
  <li>Of laughing with a sigh? — a note infallible</li>
  <li>Of breaking honesty — horsing foot on foot?</li>
  <li>Skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?</li>
  <li class="number">Hours, minutes? noon, midnight? and all eyes</li>
  <li>Blind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only,</li>
  <li>That would unseen be wicked? is this nothing?</li>
  <li>Why, then the world and all that's in't is nothing;</li>
  <li>The covering sky is nothing; Bohemia nothing;</li>
  <li class="number">My wife is nothing; nor nothing have these nothings,</li>
  <li>If this be nothing.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAMILLO</li>
  <li>Good my lord, be cured</li>
  <li>Of this diseased opinion, and betimes;</li>
  <li>For 'tis most dangerous.</li>
</ol>

  <li class="speaker">LEONTES</li>

  <li>No, no, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LEONTES</li>
  <li>It is; you lie, you lie:</li>
  <li>I say thou liest, Camillo, and I hate thee,</li>
  <li>Pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave,</li>
  <li class="number">Or else a hovering temporizer, that</li>
  <li>Canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil,</li>
  <li>Inclining to them both: were my wife's liver</li>
  <li>Infected as her life, she would not live</li>
  <li>The running of one glass.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAMILLO</li>
  <li class="number">Who does infect her?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LEONTES</li>
  <li>Why, he that wears her like a medal, hanging</li>
  <li>About his neck, Bohemia: who, if I</li>
  <li>Had servants true about me, that bare eyes</li>
  <li>To see alike mine honour as their profits,</li>
  <li class="number">Their own particular thrifts, they would do that</li>
  <li>Which should undo more doing: ay, and thou,</li>
  <li>His cupbearer —  whom I from meaner form</li>
  <li>Have benched and reared to worship, who mayst see</li>
  <li>Plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven,</li>
  <li class="number">How I am galled —  mightst bespice a cup,</li>
  <li>To give mine enemy a lasting wink;</li>
  <li>Which draught to me were cordial.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAMILLO</li>
  <li>Sir, my lord,</li>
  <li>I could do this, and that with no rash potion,</li>
  <li class="number">But with a lingering dram that should not work</li>
  <li>Maliciously like poison: but I cannot</li>
  <li>Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress,</li>
  <li>So sovereignly being honourable.</li>
  <li>I have loved thee —  </li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LEONTES</li>
  <li class="number">Make that thy question, and go rot!</li>
  <li>Dost think I am so muddy, so unsettled,</li>
  <li>To appoint myself in this vexation, sully</li>
  <li>The purity and whiteness of my sheets,</li>
  <li>Which to preserve is sleep, which being spotted</li>
  <li class="number">Is goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps,</li>
  <li>Give scandal to the blood o' the prince my son,</li>
  <li>Who I do think is mine and love as mine,</li>
  <li>Without ripe moving to't? Would I do this?</li>
  <li>Could man so blench?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAMILLO</li>
  <li class="number">I must believe you, sir:</li>
  <li>I do; and will fetch off Bohemia for't;</li>
  <li>Provided that, when he's removed, your highness</li>
  <li>Will take again your queen as yours at first,</li>
  <li>Even for your son's sake; and thereby for sealing</li>
  <li class="number">The injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms</li>
  <li>Known and allied to yours.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LEONTES</li>
  <li>Thou dost advise me</li>
  <li>Even so as I mine own course have set down:</li>
  <li>I'll give no blemish to her honour, none.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAMILLO</li>
  <li class="number">My lord,</li>
  <li>Go then; and with a countenance as clear</li>
  <li>As friendship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia</li>
  <li>And with your queen. I am his cupbearer:</li>
  <li>If from me he have wholesome beverage,</li>
  <li class="number">Account me not your servant.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LEONTES</li>
  <li>This is all:</li>
  <li>Do't and thou hast the one half of my heart;</li>
  <li>Do't not, thou split'st thine own.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAMILLO</li>
  <li>I'll do't, my lord.</li>

  <li>O miserable lady! But, for me,</li>
  <li>What case stand I in? I must be the poisoner</li>
  <li>Of good Polixenes; and my ground to do't</li>
  <li>Is the obedience to a master, one</li>
  <li class="number">Who in rebellion with himself will have</li>
  <li>All that are his so too. To do this deed,</li>
  <li>Promotion follows. If I could find example</li>

  <li>And flourish'd after, I'ld not do't; but since</li>
  <li class="number">Nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one,</li>

  <li>Hail, most royal sir!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POLIXENES</li>
  <li>What is the news i' the court?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAMILLO</li>
  <li class="number">None rare, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POLIXENES</li>
  <li>The king hath on him such a countenance</li>
  <li>As he had lost some province and a region</li>
  <li>Loved as he loves himself: even now I met him</li>
  <li>With customary compliment; when he,</li>
  <li class="number">Wafting his eyes to the contrary and falling</li>
  <li>A lip of much contempt, speeds from me and</li>
  <li>So leaves me to consider what is breeding</li>
  <li>That changeth thus his manners.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAMILLO</li>
  <li>I dare not know, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POLIXENES</li>
  <li class="number">How! dare not! do not. Do you know, and dare not?</li>
  <li>Be intelligent to me: 'tis thereabouts;</li>
  <li>For, to yourself, what you do know, you must.</li>
  <li>And cannot say, you dare not. Good Camillo,</li>
  <li>Your changed complexions are to me a mirror</li>
  <li class="number">Which shows me mine changed too; for I must be</li>
  <li>A party in this alteration, finding</li>
  <li>Myself thus alter'd with 't.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAMILLO</li>
  <li>There is a sickness</li>
  <li>Which puts some of us in distemper, but</li>
  <li class="number">I cannot name the disease; and it is caught</li>
  <li>Of you that yet are well.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POLIXENES</li>
  <li>How! caught of me!</li>
  <li>Make me not sighted like the basilisk:</li>
  <li>I have look'd on thousands, who have sped the better</li>
  <li class="number">By my regard, but kill'd none so. Camillo —  </li>
  <li>As you are certainly a gentleman, thereto</li>
  <li>Clerk-like experienced, which no less adorns</li>
  <li>Our gentry than our parents' noble names,</li>
  <li>In whose success we are gentle —  I beseech you,</li>
  <li class="number">If you know aught which does behove my knowledge</li>
  <li>Thereof to be inform'd, imprison't not</li>
  <li>In ignorant concealment.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAMILLO</li>
  <li>I may not answer.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POLIXENES</li>
  <li>A sickness caught of me, and yet I well!</li>
  <li class="number">I must be answer'd. Dost thou hear, Camillo,</li>
  <li>I conjure thee, by all the parts of man</li>
  <li>Which honour does acknowledge, whereof the least</li>
  <li>Is not this suit of mine, that thou declare</li>
  <li>What incidency thou dost guess of harm</li>
  <li class="number">Is creeping toward me; how far off, how near;</li>
  <li>Which way to be prevented, if to be;</li>
  <li>If not, how best to bear it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAMILLO</li>
  <li>Sir, I will tell you;</li>
  <li>Since I am charged in honour and by him</li>
  <li class="number">That I think honourable: therefore mark my counsel,</li>
  <li>Which must be even as swiftly follow'd as</li>
  <li>I mean to utter it, or both yourself and me</li>
  <li>Cry lost, and so good night!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POLIXENES</li>
  <li>On, good Camillo.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAMILLO</li>

  <li>By whom, Camillo?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAMILLO</li>
  <li>By the king.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POLIXENES</li>
  <li>For what?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAMILLO</li>
  <li>He thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears,</li>
  <li class="number">As he had seen't or been an instrument</li>
  <li>To vice you to't, that you have touch'd his queen</li>
  <li>Forbiddenly.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POLIXENES</li>
  <li>O, then my best blood turn</li>
  <li>To an infected jelly and my name</li>
  <li class="number">Be yoked with his that did betray the Best!</li>
  <li>Turn then my freshest reputation to</li>
  <li>A savour that may strike the dullest nostril</li>
  <li>Where I arrive, and my approach be shunn'd,</li>
  <li>Nay, hated too, worse than the great'st infection</li>
  <li class="number">That e'er was heard or read!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAMILLO</li>
  <li>Swear his thought over</li>
  <li>By each particular star in heaven and</li>
  <li>By all their influences, you may as well</li>
  <li>Forbid the sea for to obey the moon</li>
  <li class="number">As or by oath remove or counsel shake</li>
  <li>The fabric of his folly, whose foundation</li>
  <li>Is piled upon his faith and will continue</li>
  <li>The standing of his body.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POLIXENES</li>
  <li>How should this grow?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAMILLO</li>
  <li class="number">I know not: but I am sure 'tis safer to</li>
  <li>Avoid what's grown than question how 'tis born.</li>
  <li>If therefore you dare trust my honesty,</li>
  <li>That lies enclosed in this trunk which you</li>
  <li>Shall bear along impawn'd, away to-night!</li>
  <li class="number">Your followers I will whisper to the business,</li>
  <li>And will by twos and threes at several posterns</li>
  <li>Clear them o' the city. For myself, I'll put</li>
  <li>My fortunes to your service, which are here</li>
  <li>By this discovery lost. Be not uncertain;</li>
  <li class="number">For, by the honour of my parents, I</li>
  <li>Have utter'd truth: which if you seek to prove,</li>
  <li>I dare not stand by; nor shall you be safer</li>
  <li>Than one condemn'd by the king's own mouth, thereon</li>
  <li>His execution sworn.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POLIXENES</li>
  <li class="number">I do believe thee:</li>
  <li>I saw his heart in 's face. Give me thy hand:</li>
  <li>Be pilot to me and thy places shall</li>
  <li>Still neighbour mine. My ships are ready and</li>
  <li>My people did expect my hence departure</li>
  <li class="number">Two days ago. This jealousy</li>
  <li>Is for a precious creature: as she's rare,</li>
  <li>Must it be great, and as his person's mighty,</li>
  <li>Must it be violent, and as he does conceive</li>
  <li>He is dishonour'd by a man which ever</li>
  <li class="number">Profess'd to him, why, his revenges must</li>
  <li>In that be made more bitter. Fear o'ershades me:</li>
  <li>Good expedition be my friend, and comfort</li>
  <li>The gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothing</li>
  <li>Of his ill-ta'en suspicion! Come, Camillo;</li>
  <li class="number">I will respect thee as a father if</li>
  <li>Thou bear'st my life off hence: let us avoid.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAMILLO</li>
  <li>It is in mine authority to command</li>
  <li>The keys of all the posterns: please your highness</li>

  <li class="speaker">MAMILLIUS</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Lord</li>

  <li>How blest am I</li>
  <li>In my just censure, in my true opinion!</li>
  <li class="number">Alack, for lesser knowledge! how accursed</li>
  <li>In being so blest! There may be in the cup</li>
  <li>A spider steep'd, and one may drink, depart,</li>
  <li>And yet partake no venom, for his knowledge</li>
  <li>Is not infected: but if one present</li>
  <li class="number">The abhorr'd ingredient to his eye, make known</li>
  <li>How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,</li>
  <li>With violent hefts. I have drunk,</li>
  <li>and seen the spider.</li>
  <li>Camillo was his help in this, his pander:</li>
  <li class="number">There is a plot against my life, my crown;</li>
  <li>All's true that is mistrusted: that false villain</li>
  <li>Whom I employ'd was pre-employ'd by him:</li>
  <li>He has discover'd my design, and I</li>
  <li>Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick</li>

  <li>So easily open?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LEONTES</li>
  <li>You, my lords,</li>

  <li class="number">The justice of your bearts will thereto add</li>
  <li>'Tis pity she's not honest, honourable:'</li>
  <li>Praise her but for this her without-door form,</li>
  <li>Which on my faith deserves high speech, and straight</li>
  <li>The shrug, the hum or ha, these petty brands</li>
  <li class="number">That calumny doth use — O, I am out — </li>
  <li>That mercy does, for calumny will sear</li>
  <li>Virtue itself: these shrugs, these hums and ha's,</li>
  <li>When you have said 'she's goodly,' come between</li>
  <li>Ere you can say 'she's honest:' but be 't known,</li>
  <li class="number">From him that has most cause to grieve it should be,</li>
  <li>She's an adulteress.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HERMIONE</li>

  <li>You have mistook, my lady,</li>

  <li>Lest barbarism, making me the precedent,</li>
  <li class="number">Should a like language use to all degrees</li>
  <li>And mannerly distinguishment leave out</li>
  <li>Betwixt the prince and beggar: I have said</li>
  <li>She's an adulteress; I have said with whom:</li>
  <li>More, she's a traitor and Camillo is</li>
  <li class="number">A federary with her, and one that knows</li>
  <li>What she should shame to know herself</li>
  <li>But with her most vile principal, that she's</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">

  <li>No; if I mistake</li>
  <li>In those foundations which I build upon,</li>
  <li>The centre is not big enough to bear</li>
  <li class="number">A school-boy's top. Away with her! to prison!</li>

  <li>Good my lord —  </li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ANTIGONUS</li>
  <li>It is for you we speak, not for ourselves:</li>
  <li>You are abused and by some putter-on</li>
  <li>That will be damn'd for't; would I knew the villain,</li>
  <li class="number">I would land-damn him. Be she honour-flaw'd,</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LEONTES</li>
  <li>Why, what need we</li>
  <li>Commune with you of this, but rather follow</li>
  <li class="number">Our forceful instigation? Our prerogative</li>
  <li>Calls not your counsels, but our natural goodness</li>
  <li>Imparts this; which if you, or stupefied</li>
  <li>Or seeming so in skill, cannot or will not</li>
  <li>Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves</li>
  <li class="number">We need no more of your advice: the matter,</li>

  <li>Either thou art most ignorant by age,</li>

  <li class="number">Which was as gross as ever touch'd conjecture,</li>
  <li>That lack'd sight only, nought for approbation</li>
  <li>But only seeing, all other circumstances</li>
  <li>Made up to the deed, doth push on this proceeding:</li>
  <li>Yet, for a greater confirmation,</li>
  <li class="number">For in an act of this importance 'twere</li>
  <li>Most piteous to be wild, I have dispatch'd in post</li>
  <li>To sacred Delphos, to Apollo's temple,</li>
  <li>Cleomenes and Dion, whom you know</li>
  <li>Of stuff'd sufficiency: now from the oracle</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LEONTES</li>
  <li>Though I am satisfied and need no more</li>
  <li>Than what I know, yet shall the oracle</li>
  <li class="number">Give rest to the minds of others, such as he</li>
  <li>Whose ignorant credulity will not</li>
  <li>Come up to the truth. So have we thought it good</li>
  <li>From our free person she should be confined,</li>
  <li>Lest that the treachery of the two fled hence</li>
  <li class="number">Be left her to perform. Come, follow us;</li>
  <li>We are to speak in public; for this business</li>
  <li>Will raise us all.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LEONTES</li>
  <li>How!</li>
  <li class="number">Away with that audacious lady! Antigonus,</li>
  <li>I charged thee that she should not come about me:</li>
  <li>I knew she would.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ANTIGONUS</li>
  <li>I told her so, my lord,</li>
  <li>On your displeasure's peril and on mine,</li>

  <li>But she'll not stumble.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PAULINA</li>
  <li>Good my liege, I come;</li>
  <li class="number">And, I beseech you, hear me, who profess</li>
  <li>Myself your loyal servant, your physician,</li>
  <li>Your most obedient counsellor, yet that dare</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LEONTES</li>
  <li>Force her hence.</li>

  <li>Let him that makes but trifles of his eyes</li>
  <li>First hand me: on mine own accord I'll off;</li>
  <li>But first I'll do my errand. The good queen,</li>
  <li class="number">For she is good, hath brought you forth a daughter;</li>
  <li>Here 'tis; commends it to your blessing.</li>

  <li class="number">with Polixenes, king of Bohemia, and conspiring</li>

  <li>Appear'd to me last night, for ne'er was dream</li>
  <li>So like a waking. To me comes a creature,</li>
  <li class="number">Sometimes her head on one side, some another;</li>
  <li>I never saw a vessel of like sorrow,</li>
  <li>So fill'd and so becoming: in pure white robes,</li>

  <li>She melted into air. Affrighted much,</li>
  <li>I did in time collect myself and thought</li>
  <li>This was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys:</li>
  <li class="number">Yet for this once, yea, superstitiously,</li>

  <li>There lie, and there thy character: there these;</li>

  <li>And still rest thine. The storm begins; poor wretch,</li>
  <li class="number">That for thy mother's fault art thus exposed</li>
  <li>To loss and what may follow! Weep I cannot,</li>

  <li>The day frowns more and more: thou'rt like to have</li>

  <li>his name was Antigonus, a nobleman. But to make an</li>

  <li>I pray thee, good Camillo, be no more importunate:</li>
  <li>'tis a sickness denying thee any thing; a death to</li>
  <li>grant this.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAMILLO</li>
  <li>It is fifteen years since I saw my country: though</li>
  <li class="number">I have for the most part been aired abroad, I</li>
  <li>desire to lay my bones there. Besides, the penitent</li>
  <li>king, my master, hath sent for me; to whose feeling</li>
  <li>sorrows I might be some allay, or I o'erween to</li>
  <li>think so, which is another spur to my departure.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POLIXENES</li>
  <li class="number">As thou lovest me, Camillo, wipe not out the rest of</li>
  <li>thy services by leaving me now: the need I have of</li>
  <li>thee thine own goodness hath made; better not to</li>
  <li>have had thee than thus to want thee: thou, having</li>
  <li>made me businesses which none without thee can</li>
  <li class="number">sufficiently manage, must either stay to execute</li>
  <li>them thyself or take away with thee the very</li>
  <li>services thou hast done; which if I have not enough</li>
  <li>considered, as too much I cannot, to be more</li>
  <li>thankful to thee shall be my study, and my profit</li>
  <li class="number">therein the heaping friendships. Of that fatal</li>
  <li>country, Sicilia, prithee speak no more; whose very</li>
  <li>naming punishes me with the remembrance of that</li>
  <li>penitent, as thou callest him, and reconciled king,</li>
  <li>my brother; whose loss of his most precious queen</li>
  <li class="number">and children are even now to be afresh lamented.</li>
  <li>Say to me, when sawest thou the Prince Florizel, my</li>
  <li>son? Kings are no less unhappy, their issue not</li>
  <li>being gracious, than they are in losing them when</li>
  <li>they have approved their virtues.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAMILLO</li>
  <li class="number">Sir, it is three days since I saw the prince. What</li>
  <li>his happier affairs may be, are to me unknown: but I</li>
  <li>have missingly noted, he is of late much retired</li>
  <li>from court and is less frequent to his princely</li>
  <li>exercises than formerly he hath appeared.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POLIXENES</li>
  <li class="number">I have considered so much, Camillo, and with some</li>
  <li>care; so far that I have eyes under my service which</li>
  <li>look upon his removedness; from whom I have this</li>
  <li>intelligence, that he is seldom from the house of a</li>
  <li>most homely shepherd; a man, they say, that from</li>
  <li class="number">very nothing, and beyond the imagination of his</li>
  <li>neighbours, is grown into an unspeakable estate.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAMILLO</li>
  <li>I have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a</li>
  <li>daughter of most rare note: the report of her is</li>
  <li>extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POLIXENES</li>
  <li class="number">That's likewise part of my intelligence; but, I</li>
  <li>fear, the angle that plucks our son thither. Thou</li>
  <li>shalt accompany us to the place; where we will, not</li>
  <li>appearing what we are, have some question with the</li>
  <li>shepherd; from whose simplicity I think it not</li>
  <li class="number">uneasy to get the cause of my son's resort thither.</li>
  <li>Prithee, be my present partner in this business, and</li>
  <li>lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia.</li>
</ol>

  <li class="number">The white sheet bleaching on the hedge,</li>
  <li>With heigh! the sweet birds, O, how they sing!</li>
  <li>Doth set my pugging tooth on edge;</li>
  <li>For a quart of ale is a dish for a king.</li>
  <li>The lark, that tirra-lyra chants,</li>
  <li class="number">With heigh! with heigh! the thrush and the jay,</li>
  <li>Are summer songs for me and my aunts,</li>

  <li>I have served Prince Florizel and in my time</li>
  <li>wore three-pile; but now I am out of service:</li>
  <li class="number">But shall I go mourn for that, my dear?</li>
  <li>The pale moon shines by night:</li>

  <li>Then my account I well may, give,</li>
  <li>And in the stocks avouch it.</li>
  <li>My traffic is sheets; when the kite builds, look to</li>
  <li>lesser linen. My father named me Autolycus; who</li>
  <li class="number">being, as I am, littered under Mercury, was likewise</li>
  <li>a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles. With die and</li>
  <li>drab I purchased this caparison, and my revenue is</li>
  <li>the silly cheat. Gallows and knock are too powerful</li>
  <li>on the highway: beating and hanging are terrors to</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Clown</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">AUTOLYCUS</li>
  <li>Vices, I would say, sir. I know this man well: he</li>

  <li>motion of the Prodigal Son, and married a tinker's</li>
  <li>wife within a mile where my land and living lies;</li>

  <li>And, friends unknown, you shall bear witness to 't:</li>
  <li class="number">I give my daughter to him, and will make</li>
  <li>Her portion equal his.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FLORIZEL</li>
  <li>O, that must be</li>
  <li>I' the virtue of your daughter: one being dead,</li>
  <li>I shall have more than you can dream of yet;</li>
  <li class="number">Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,</li>
  <li>Contract us 'fore these witnesses.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Shepherd</li>
  <li>Come, your hand;</li>
  <li>And, daughter, yours.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POLIXENES</li>
  <li>Soft, swain, awhile, beseech you;</li>
  <li class="number">Have you a father?</li>

  <li>I have: but what of him?</li>

  <li>He neither does nor shall.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POLIXENES</li>
  <li>Methinks a father</li>
  <li class="number">Is at the nuptial of his son a guest</li>
  <li>That best becomes the table. Pray you once more,</li>
  <li>Is not your father grown incapable</li>
  <li>Of reasonable affairs? is he not stupid</li>
  <li>With age and altering rheums? can he speak? hear?</li>
  <li class="number">Know man from man? dispute his own estate?</li>
  <li>Lies he not bed-rid? and again does nothing</li>
  <li>But what he did being childish?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FLORIZEL</li>
  <li>No, good sir;</li>
  <li>He has his health and ampler strength indeed</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POLIXENES</li>
  <li>By my white beard,</li>
  <li>You offer him, if this be so, a wrong</li>
  <li>Something unfilial: reason my son</li>
  <li>Should choose himself a wife, but as good reason</li>
  <li class="number">The father, all whose joy is nothing else</li>
  <li>But fair posterity, should hold some counsel</li>
  <li>In such a business.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FLORIZEL</li>
  <li>I yield all this;</li>
  <li>But for some other reasons, my grave sir,</li>

  <li class="speaker">FLORIZEL</li>
  <li class="number">No, he must not.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Shepherd</li>

  <li>At knowing of thy choice.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">

  <li>Come, come, he must not.</li>
  <li>Mark our contract.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POLIXENES</li>
  <li class="number">Mark your divorce, young sir,</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Discovering himself</li>
  <li>Whom son I dare not call; thou art too base</li>

  <li>That thus affect'st a sheep-hook! Thou old traitor,</li>
  <li>I am sorry that by hanging thee I can</li>
  <li class="number">But shorten thy life one week. And thou, fresh piece</li>

  <li>O, my heart!</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POLIXENES</li>
  <li>I'll have thy beauty scratch'd with briers, and made</li>

  <li>If I may ever know thou dost but sigh</li>
  <li>That thou no more shalt see this knack, as never</li>
  <li>I mean thou shalt, we'll bar thee from succession;</li>
  <li>Not hold thee of our blood, no, not our kin,</li>
  <li class="number">Far than Deucalion off: mark thou my words:</li>
  <li>Follow us to the court. Thou churl, for this time,</li>
  <li>Though full of our displeasure, yet we free thee</li>

  <li>Worthy enough a herdsman: yea, him too,</li>
  <li class="number">That makes himself, but for our honour therein,</li>
  <li>Unworthy thee —  if ever henceforth thou</li>
  <li>These rural latches to his entrance open,</li>
  <li>Or hoop his body more with thy embraces,</li>
  <li>I will devise a death as cruel for thee</li>

  <li>Gracious my lord,</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FLORIZEL</li>
  <li>It cannot fail but by</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAMILLO</li>

</ol>

  <li class="speaker">FLORIZEL</li>
  <li>I am, and by my fancy: if my reason</li>

  <li>If not, my senses, better pleased with madness,</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">

  <li class="number">This is desperate, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FLORIZEL</li>
  <li>So call it: but it does fulfil my vow;</li>
  <li>I needs must think it honesty. Camillo,</li>

  <li>Be thereat glean'd, for all the sun sees or</li>
  <li class="number">The close earth wombs or the profound sea hides</li>
  <li>In unknown fathoms, will I break my oath</li>
  <li>To this my fair beloved: therefore, I pray you,</li>
  <li>As you have ever been my father's honour'd friend,</li>
  <li>When he shall miss me —  as, in faith, I mean not</li>
  <li class="number">To see him any more —  cast your good counsels</li>
  <li>Upon his passion; let myself and fortune</li>
  <li>Tug for the time to come. This you may know</li>
  <li>And so deliver, I am put to sea</li>
  <li>With her whom here I cannot hold on shore;</li>
  <li class="number">And most opportune to our need I have</li>
  <li>A vessel rides fast by, but not prepared</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAMILLO</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAMILLO</li>
  <li class="number">He's irremoveable,</li>

  <li>His going I could frame to serve my turn,</li>

  <li>Purchase the sight again of dear Sicilia</li>
  <li class="number">And that unhappy king, my master, whom</li>
  <li>I so much thirst to see.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FLORIZEL</li>
  <li>Now, good Camillo;</li>
  <li>I am so fraught with curious business that</li>
  <li>I leave out ceremony.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAMILLO</li>
  <li class="number">Sir, I think</li>
  <li>You have heard of my poor services, i' the love</li>
  <li>That I have borne your father?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FLORIZEL</li>
  <li>Very nobly</li>
  <li>Have you deserved: it is my father's music</li>
  <li class="number">To speak your deeds, not little of his care</li>
  <li>To have them recompensed as thought on.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAMILLO</li>
  <li>Well, my lord,</li>
  <li>If you may please to think I love the king</li>
  <li>And through him what is nearest to him, which is</li>
  <li class="number">Your gracious self, embrace but my direction:</li>
  <li>If your more ponderous and settled project</li>
  <li>May suffer alteration, on mine honour,</li>
  <li>I'll point you where you shall have such receiving</li>
  <li>As shall become your highness; where you may</li>
  <li class="number">Enjoy your mistress, from the whom, I see,</li>
  <li>There's no disjunction to be made, but by — </li>
  <li>As heavens forefend! — your ruin; marry her,</li>
  <li>And, with my best endeavours in your absence,</li>
  <li>Your discontenting father strive to qualify</li>
  <li class="number">And bring him up to liking.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FLORIZEL</li>
  <li>How, Camillo,</li>
  <li>May this, almost a miracle, be done?</li>
  <li>That I may call thee something more than man</li>
  <li>And after that trust to thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAMILLO</li>
  <li class="number">Have you thought on</li>
  <li>A place whereto you'll go?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FLORIZEL</li>
  <li>Not any yet:</li>
  <li>But as the unthought-on accident is guilty</li>
  <li>To what we wildly do, so we profess</li>
  <li class="number">Ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies</li>
  <li>Of every wind that blows.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAMILLO</li>
  <li>Then list to me:</li>
  <li>This follows, if you will not change your purpose</li>
  <li>But undergo this flight, make for Sicilia,</li>
  <li class="number">And there present yourself and your fair princess,</li>
  <li>For so I see she must be, 'fore Leontes:</li>
  <li>She shall be habited as it becomes</li>
  <li>The partner of your bed. Methinks I see</li>
  <li>Leontes opening his free arms and weeping</li>
  <li class="number">His welcomes forth; asks thee the son forgiveness,</li>
  <li>As 'twere i' the father's person; kisses the hands</li>
  <li>Of your fresh princess; o'er and o'er divides him</li>
  <li>'Twixt his unkindness and his kindness; the one</li>
  <li>He chides to hell and bids the other grow</li>
  <li class="number">Faster than thought or time.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FLORIZEL</li>
  <li>Worthy Camillo,</li>
  <li>What colour for my visitation shall I</li>
  <li>Hold up before him?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAMILLO</li>
  <li>Sent by the king your father</li>
  <li class="number">To greet him and to give him comforts. Sir,</li>
  <li>The manner of your bearing towards him, with</li>
  <li>What you as from your father shall deliver,</li>
  <li>Things known betwixt us three, I'll write you down:</li>
  <li>The which shall point you forth at every sitting</li>
  <li class="number">What you must say; that he shall not perceive</li>
  <li>But that you have your father's bosom there</li>
  <li>And speak his very heart.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FLORIZEL</li>
  <li>I am bound to you:</li>
  <li>There is some sap in this.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAMILLO</li>
  <li class="number">A cause more promising</li>
  <li>Than a wild dedication of yourselves</li>
  <li>To unpath'd waters, undream'd shores, most certain</li>
  <li>To miseries enough; no hope to help you,</li>
  <li>But as you shake off one to take another;</li>
  <li class="number">Nothing so certain as your anchors, who</li>
  <li>Do their best office, if they can but stay you</li>
  <li>Where you'll be loath to be: besides you know</li>
  <li>Prosperity's the very bond of love,</li>
  <li>Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together</li>
  <li class="number">Affliction alters.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PERDITA</li>
  <li>One of these is true:</li>
  <li>I think affliction may subdue the cheek,</li>
  <li>But not take in the mind.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAMILLO</li>
  <li>Yea, say you so?</li>
  <li class="number">There shall not at your father's house these</li>
  <li>seven years</li>
  <li>Be born another such.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FLORIZEL</li>
  <li>My good Camillo,</li>
  <li>She is as forward of her breeding as</li>
  <li class="number">She is i' the rear our birth.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAMILLO</li>
  <li>I cannot say 'tis pity</li>
  <li>She lacks instructions, for she seems a mistress</li>
  <li>To most that teach.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PERDITA</li>
  <li>Your pardon, sir; for this</li>
  <li class="number">I'll blush you thanks.</li>

  <li>But O, the thorns we stand upon! Camillo,</li>
  <li>Preserver of my father, now of me,</li>
  <li>The medicine of our house, how shall we do?</li>
  <li class="number">We are not furnish'd like Bohemia's son,</li>
  <li>Nor shall appear in Sicilia.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAMILLO</li>
  <li>My lord,</li>
  <li>Fear none of this: I think you know my fortunes</li>
  <li>Do all lie there: it shall be so my care</li>
  <li class="number">To have you royally appointed as if</li>
  <li>The scene you play were mine. For instance, sir,</li>
  <li>That you may know you shall not want, one word.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">AUTOLYCUS</li>
  <li>Ha, ha! what a fool Honesty is! and Trust, his</li>
  <li>sworn brother, a very simple gentleman! I have sold</li>
  <li class="number">all my trumpery; not a counterfeit stone, not a</li>
  <li>ribbon, glass, pomander, brooch, table-book, ballad,</li>
  <li>knife, tape, glove, shoe-tie, bracelet, horn-ring,</li>
  <li>to keep my pack from fasting: they throng who</li>
  <li>should buy first, as if my trinkets had been</li>
  <li class="number">hallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer:</li>
  <li>by which means I saw whose purse was best in</li>
  <li>picture; and what I saw, to my good use I</li>
  <li>remembered. My clown, who wants but something to</li>
  <li>be a reasonable man, grew so in love with the</li>
  <li class="number">wenches' song, that he would not stir his pettitoes</li>
  <li>till he had both tune and words; which so drew the</li>
  <li>rest of the herd to me that all their other senses</li>
  <li>stuck in ears: you might have pinched a placket, it</li>
  <li>was senseless; 'twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a</li>
  <li class="number">purse; I could have filed keys off that hung in</li>
  <li>chains: no hearing, no feeling, but my sir's song,</li>
  <li>and admiring the nothing of it. So that in this</li>
  <li>time of lethargy I picked and cut most of their</li>
  <li>festival purses; and had not the old man come in</li>
  <li class="number">with a whoo-bub against his daughter and the king's</li>
  <li>son and scared my choughs from the chaff, I had not</li>
  <li>left a purse alive in the whole army.</li>

  <li class="speaker">FLORIZEL</li>
  <li class="number">O Perdita, what have we twain forgot!</li>
  <li>Pray you, a word.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAMILLO</li>
  <li>Aside  What I do next, shall be to tell the king</li>
  <li>Of this escape and whither they are bound;</li>
  <li>Wherein my hope is I shall so prevail</li>
  <li class="number">To force him after: in whose company</li>
  <li>I shall review Sicilia, for whose sight</li>
  <li>I have a woman's longing.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FLORIZEL</li>

  <li class="speaker">AUTOLYCUS</li>
  <li>I understand the business, I hear it: to have an</li>
  <li>open ear, a quick eye, and a nimble hand, is</li>
  <li>necessary for a cut-purse; a good nose is requisite</li>
  <li>also, to smell out work for the other senses. I see</li>
  <li class="number">this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive.</li>
  <li>What an exchange had this been without boot! What</li>
  <li>a boot is here with this exchange! Sure the gods do</li>
  <li>this year connive at us, and we may do any thing</li>
  <li>extempore. The prince himself is about a piece of</li>
  <li class="number">iniquity, stealing away from his father with his</li>
  <li>clog at his heels: if I thought it were a piece of</li>
  <li>honesty to acquaint the king withal, I would not</li>
  <li>do't: I hold it the more knavery to conceal it;</li>
  <li>and therein am I constant to my profession.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Re-enter Clown and Shepherd</li>
  <li class="number">Aside, aside; here is more matter for a hot brain:</li>

  <li class="speaker">Clown</li>
  <li>See, see; what a man you are now!</li>
  <li>There is no other way but to tell the king</li>

  <li class="speaker">Shepherd</li>
  <li>Go to, then.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Clown</li>
  <li>She being none of your flesh and blood, your flesh</li>

  <li>those things you found about her, those secret</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Shepherd</li>
  <li class="number">I will tell the king all, every word, yea, and his</li>

  <li>me the king's brother-in-law.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Clown</li>
  <li>Indeed, brother-in-law was the farthest off you</li>

  <li>We are but plain fellows, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">AUTOLYCUS</li>
  <li>A lie; you are rough and hairy. Let me have no</li>
  <li>lying: it becomes none but tradesmen, and they</li>
  <li>often give us soldiers the lie: but we pay them for</li>
  <li class="number">it with stamped coin, not stabbing steel; therefore</li>
  <li>they do not give us the lie.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Clown</li>
  <li>Your worship had like to have given us one, if you</li>
  <li>had not taken yourself with the manner.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Shepherd</li>
  <li>Are you a courtier, an't like you, sir?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">AUTOLYCUS</li>
  <li class="number">Whether it like me or no, I am a courtier. Seest</li>
  <li>thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings?</li>
  <li>hath not my gait in it the measure of the court?</li>
  <li>receives not thy nose court-odor from me? reflect I</li>
  <li>not on thy baseness court-contempt? Thinkest thou,</li>
  <li class="number">for that I insinuate, or toaze from thee thy</li>
  <li>business, I am therefore no courtier? I am courtier</li>
  <li>cap-a-pe; and one that will either push on or pluck</li>
  <li>back thy business there: whereupon I command thee to</li>
  <li>open thy affair.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Shepherd</li>
  <li class="number">My business, sir, is to the king.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">AUTOLYCUS</li>
  <li>What advocate hast thou to him?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Shepherd</li>
  <li>I know not, an't like you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Clown</li>
  <li>Advocate's the court-word for a pheasant: say you</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Shepherd</li>
  <li class="number">None, sir; I have no pheasant, cock nor hen.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">AUTOLYCUS</li>
  <li>How blessed are we that are not simple men!</li>
  <li>Yet nature might have made me as these are,</li>
  <li>Therefore I will not disdain.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Clown</li>
  <li>This cannot be but a great courtier.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Shepherd</li>
  <li class="number">His garments are rich, but he wears</li>
  <li>them not handsomely.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Clown</li>
  <li>He seems to be the more noble in being fantastical:</li>
  <li>a great man, I'll warrant; I know by the picking</li>
  <li>on's teeth.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">AUTOLYCUS</li>
  <li class="number">The fardel there? what's i' the fardel?</li>
  <li>Wherefore that box?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Shepherd</li>
  <li>Sir, there lies such secrets in this fardel and box,</li>
  <li>which none must know but the king; and which he</li>

  <li class="number">speech of him.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">AUTOLYCUS</li>
  <li>Age, thou hast lost thy labour.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Shepherd</li>
  <li>Why, sir?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">AUTOLYCUS</li>
  <li>The king is not at the palace; he is gone aboard a</li>
  <li>new ship to purge melancholy and air himself: for,</li>
  <li class="number">if thou beest capable of things serious, thou must</li>
  <li>know the king is full of grief.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Shepard</li>
  <li>So 'tis said, sir; about his son, that should have</li>
  <li>married a shepherd's daughter.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">AUTOLYCUS</li>
  <li>If that shepherd be not in hand-fast, let him fly:</li>
  <li class="number">the curses he shall have, the tortures he shall</li>
  <li>feel, will break the back of man, the heart of monster.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Clown</li>
  <li>Think you so, sir?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">AUTOLYCUS</li>
  <li>Not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy</li>
  <li>and vengeance bitter; but those that are germane to</li>
  <li class="number">him, though removed fifty times, shall all come</li>
  <li>under the hangman: which though it be great pity,</li>
  <li>yet it is necessary. An old sheep-whistling rogue a</li>
  <li>ram-tender, to offer to have his daughter come into</li>
  <li>grace! Some say he shall be stoned; but that death</li>
  <li class="number">is too soft for him, say I draw our throne into a</li>
  <li>sheep-cote! all deaths are too few, the sharpest too easy.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Clown</li>
  <li>Has the old man e'er a son, sir, do you hear. an't</li>
  <li>like you, sir?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">AUTOLYCUS</li>
  <li>He has a son, who shall be flayed alive; then</li>
  <li class="number">'nointed over with honey, set on the head of a</li>
  <li>wasp's nest; then stand till he be three quarters</li>
  <li>and a dram dead; then recovered again with</li>
  <li>aqua-vitae or some other hot infusion; then, raw as</li>
  <li>he is, and in the hottest day prognostication</li>
  <li class="number">proclaims, shall be be set against a brick-wall, the</li>
  <li>sun looking with a southward eye upon him, where he</li>
  <li>is to behold him with flies blown to death. But what</li>
  <li>talk we of these traitorly rascals, whose miseries</li>
  <li>are to be smiled at, their offences being so</li>
  <li class="number">capital? Tell me, for you seem to be honest plain</li>
  <li>men, what you have to the king: being something</li>
  <li>gently considered, I'll bring you where he is</li>
  <li>aboard, tender your persons to his presence,</li>
  <li>whisper him in your behalfs; and if it be in man</li>
  <li class="number">besides the king to effect your suits, here is man</li>
  <li>shall do it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Clown</li>
  <li>He seems to be of great authority: close with him,</li>
  <li>give him gold; and though authority be a stubborn</li>
  <li>bear, yet he is oft led by the nose with gold: show</li>
  <li class="number">the inside of your purse to the outside of his hand,</li>
  <li>and no more ado. Remember 'stoned,' and 'flayed alive.'</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Shepherd</li>
  <li>An't please you, sir, to undertake the business for</li>
  <li>us, here is that gold I have: I'll make it as much</li>
  <li>more and leave this young man in pawn till I bring it you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">AUTOLYCUS</li>
  <li class="number">After I have done what I promised?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Shepherd</li>
  <li>Ay, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">AUTOLYCUS</li>
  <li>Well, give me the moiety. Are you a party in this business?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Clown</li>
  <li>In some sort, sir: but though my case be a pitiful</li>
  <li>one, I hope I shall not be flayed out of it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">AUTOLYCUS</li>
  <li class="number">O, that's the case of the shepherd's son: hang him,</li>
  <li>he'll be made an example.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Clown</li>
  <li>Comfort, good comfort! We must to the king and show</li>
  <li>our strange sights: he must know 'tis none of your</li>
  <li>daughter nor my sister; we are gone else. Sir, I</li>
  <li class="number">will give you as much as this old man does when the</li>
  <li>business is performed, and remain, as he says, your</li>
  <li>pawn till it be brought you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">AUTOLYCUS</li>
  <li>I will trust you. Walk before toward the sea-side;</li>
  <li>go on the right hand: I will but look upon the</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Clown</li>
  <li>We are blest in this man, as I may say, even blest.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">AUTOLYCUS</li>
  <li>If I had a mind to be honest, I see Fortune would</li>

  <li>to do the prince my master good; which who knows how</li>

  <li class="number">complaint they have to the king concerns him</li>
  <li>nothing, let him call me rogue for being so far</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CLEOMENES</li>
  <li>Sir, you have done enough, and have perform'd</li>
  <li>A saint-like sorrow: no fault could you make,</li>
  <li>Which you have not redeem'd; indeed, paid down</li>
  <li>More penitence than done trespass: at the last,</li>
  <li class="number">Do as the heavens have done, forget your evil;</li>
  <li>With them forgive yourself.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LEONTES</li>
  <li>Whilst I remember</li>
  <li>Her and her virtues, I cannot forget</li>
  <li>My blemishes in them, and so still think of</li>
  <li class="number">The wrong I did myself; which was so much,</li>
  <li>That heirless it hath made my kingdom and</li>
  <li>Destroy'd the sweet'st companion that e'er man</li>
  <li>Bred his hopes out of.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PAULINA</li>
  <li>True, too true, my lord:</li>
  <li class="number">If, one by one, you wedded all the world,</li>
  <li>Or from the all that are took something good,</li>
  <li>To make a perfect woman, she you kill'd</li>
  <li>Would be unparallel'd.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LEONTES</li>
  <li>I think so. Kill'd!</li>
  <li class="number">She I kill'd! I did so: but thou strikest me</li>
  <li>Sorely, to say I did; it is as bitter</li>

  <li class="number">If you would not so,</li>

  <li>There is none worthy,</li>

  <li>That King Leontes shall not have an heir</li>
  <li>Till his lost child be found? which that it shall,</li>

  <li>As my Antigonus to break his grave</li>
  <li class="number">And come again to me; who, on my life,</li>
  <li>Did perish with the infant. 'Tis your counsel</li>

  <li class="stage-direction">To LEONTES</li>
  <li>Care not for issue;</li>

  <li>Thou speak'st truth.</li>
  <li>No more such wives; therefore, no wife: one worse,</li>

  <li>Were I the ghost that walk'd, I'ld bid you mark</li>

  <li>You chose her; then I'ld shriek, that even your ears</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LEONTES</li>

  <li>O Hermione,</li>
  <li>As every present time doth boast itself</li>

  <li class="number">Have said and writ so, but your writing now</li>
  <li>Is colder than that theme, 'She had not been,</li>

<h3>SCENE II.  Before LEONTES' palace.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter AUTOLYCUS and a Gentleman</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">AUTOLYCUS</li>
  <li>Beseech you, sir, were you present at this relation?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Gentleman</li>
  <li>I was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the old</li>
  <li>shepherd deliver the manner how he found it:</li>
  <li>whereupon, after a little amazedness, we were all</li>
  <li class="number">commanded out of the chamber; only this methought I</li>
  <li>heard the shepherd say, he found the child.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">AUTOLYCUS</li>
  <li>I would most gladly know the issue of it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Gentleman</li>
  <li>I make a broken delivery of the business; but the</li>
  <li>changes I perceived in the king and Camillo were</li>
  <li class="number">very notes of admiration: they seemed almost, with</li>
  <li>staring on one another, to tear the cases of their</li>
  <li>eyes; there was speech in their dumbness, language</li>
  <li>in their very gesture; they looked as they had heard</li>
  <li>of a world ransomed, or one destroyed: a notable</li>
  <li class="number">passion of wonder appeared in them; but the wisest</li>
  <li>beholder, that knew no more but seeing, could not</li>
  <li>say if the importance were joy or sorrow; but in the</li>
  <li>extremity of the one, it must needs be.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Enter another Gentleman</li>
  <li>Here comes a gentleman that haply knows more.</li>
  <li class="number">The news, Rogero?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Gentleman</li>
  <li>Nothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled; the</li>
  <li>king's daughter is found: such a deal of wonder is</li>
  <li>broken out within this hour that ballad-makers</li>
  <li>cannot be able to express it.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Enter a third Gentleman</li>
  <li class="number">Here comes the Lady Paulina's steward: he can</li>
  <li>deliver you more. How goes it now, sir? this news</li>
  <li>which is called true is so like an old tale, that</li>
  <li>the verity of it is in strong suspicion: has the king</li>
  <li>found his heir?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Third Gentleman</li>
  <li class="number">Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by</li>
  <li>circumstance: that which you hear you'll swear you</li>
  <li>see, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle</li>
  <li>of Queen Hermione's, her jewel about the neck of it,</li>
  <li>the letters of Antigonus found with it which they</li>
  <li class="number">know to be his character, the majesty of the</li>
  <li>creature in resemblance of the mother, the affection</li>
  <li>of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding,</li>
  <li>and many other evidences proclaim her with all</li>
  <li>certainty to be the king's daughter. Did you see</li>
  <li class="number">the meeting of the two kings?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Gentleman</li>
  <li>No.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Third Gentleman</li>
  <li>Then have you lost a sight, which was to be seen,</li>
  <li>cannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld one</li>
  <li>joy crown another, so and in such manner that it</li>
  <li class="number">seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their</li>
  <li>joy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes,</li>
  <li>holding up of hands, with countenances of such</li>
  <li>distraction that they were to be known by garment,</li>
  <li>not by favour. Our king, being ready to leap out of</li>
  <li class="number">himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that</li>
  <li>joy were now become a loss, cries 'O, thy mother,</li>
  <li>thy mother!' then asks Bohemia forgiveness; then</li>
  <li>embraces his son-in-law; then again worries he his</li>
  <li>daughter with clipping her; now he thanks the old</li>
  <li class="number">shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten</li>
  <li>conduit of many kings' reigns. I never heard of such</li>
  <li>another encounter, which lames report to follow it</li>
  <li>and undoes description to do it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Gentleman</li>
  <li>What, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carried</li>
  <li class="number">hence the child?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Third Gentleman</li>
  <li>Like an old tale still, which will have matter to</li>
  <li>rehearse, though credit be asleep and not an ear</li>
  <li>open. He was torn to pieces with a bear: this</li>
  <li>avouches the shepherd's son; who has not only his</li>
  <li class="number">innocence, which seems much, to justify him, but a</li>
  <li>handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Gentleman</li>
  <li>What became of his bark and his followers?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Third Gentleman</li>
  <li>Wrecked the same instant of their master's death and</li>
  <li>in the view of the shepherd: so that all the</li>
  <li class="number">instruments which aided to expose the child were</li>
  <li>even then lost when it was found. But O, the noble</li>
  <li>combat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was fought in</li>
  <li>Paulina! She had one eye declined for the loss of</li>
  <li>her husband, another elevated that the oracle was</li>
  <li class="number">fulfilled: she lifted the princess from the earth,</li>
  <li>and so locks her in embracing, as if she would pin</li>
  <li>her to her heart that she might no more be in danger</li>
  <li>of losing.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Gentleman</li>
  <li>The dignity of this act was worth the audience of</li>
  <li class="number">kings and princes; for by such was it acted.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Third Gentleman</li>
  <li>One of the prettiest touches of all and that which</li>
  <li>angled for mine eyes, caught the water though not</li>
  <li>the fish, was when, at the relation of the queen's</li>
  <li>death, with the manner how she came to't bravely</li>
  <li class="number">confessed and lamented by the king, how</li>
  <li>attentiveness wounded his daughter; till, from one</li>
  <li>sign of dolour to another, she did, with an 'Alas,'</li>
  <li>I would fain say, bleed tears, for I am sure my</li>
  <li>heart wept blood. Who was most marble there changed</li>
  <li class="number">colour; some swooned, all sorrowed: if all the world</li>
  <li>could have seen 't, the woe had been universal.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Gentleman</li>
  <li>Are they returned to the court?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Third Gentleman</li>
  <li>No: the princess hearing of her mother's statue,</li>
  <li>which is in the keeping of Paulina —  a piece many</li>
  <li class="number">years in doing and now newly performed by that rare</li>
  <li>Italian master, Julio Romano, who, had he himself</li>
  <li>eternity and could put breath into his work, would</li>
  <li>beguile Nature of her custom, so perfectly he is her</li>
  <li>ape: he so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that</li>
  <li class="number">they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of</li>
  <li>answer: thither with all greediness of affection</li>
  <li>are they gone, and there they intend to sup.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Second Gentleman</li>
  <li>I thought she had some great matter there in hand;</li>
  <li>for she hath privately twice or thrice a day, ever</li>
  <li class="number">since the death of Hermione, visited that removed</li>
  <li>house. Shall we thither and with our company piece</li>
  <li>the rejoicing?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">First Gentleman</li>
  <li>Who would be thence that has the benefit of access?</li>
  <li>every wink of an eye some new grace will be born:</li>
  <li class="number">our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge.</li>
  <li>Let's along.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">AUTOLYCUS</li>
  <li>Now, had I not the dash of my former life in me,</li>
  <li>would preferment drop on my head. I brought the old</li>
  <li>man and his son aboard the prince: told him I heard</li>
  <li class="number">them talk of a fardel and I know not what: but he</li>
  <li>at that time, overfond of the shepherd's daughter,</li>
  <li>so he then took her to be, who began to be much</li>
  <li>sea-sick, and himself little better, extremity of</li>
  <li>weather continuing, this mystery remained</li>
  <li class="number">undiscovered. But 'tis all one to me; for had I</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Clown</li>
  <li>So you have: but I was a gentleman born before my</li>

  <li>father brother; and then the prince my brother and</li>
  <li class="number">the princess my sister called my father father; and</li>

  <li>franklins say it, I'll swear it.</li>

  <li class="speaker">Shepherd</li>
  <li>How if it be false, son?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Clown</li>
  <li>If it be ne'er so false, a true gentleman may swear</li>
  <li class="number">it in the behalf of his friend: and I'll swear to</li>
  <li>the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and</li>
  <li>that thou wilt not be drunk; but I know thou art no</li>
  <li>tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be</li>
  <li>drunk: but I'll swear it, and I would thou wouldst</li>
  <li class="number">be a tall fellow of thy hands.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">AUTOLYCUS</li>
  <li>I will prove so, sir, to my power.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Clown</li>
  <li>Ay, by any means prove a tall fellow: if I do not</li>
  <li>wonder how thou darest venture to be drunk, not</li>
  <li>being a tall fellow, trust me not. Hark! the kings</li>
  <li class="number">and the princes, our kindred, are going to see the</li>
  <li>queen's picture. Come, follow us: we'll be thy</li>
  <li>good masters.</li>

<h3>SCENE III.  A chapel in PAULINA'S house.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter LEONTES, POLIXENES, FLORIZEL, PERDITA,
CAMILLO, PAULINA, Lords, and Attendants</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LEONTES</li>
  <li>O grave and good Paulina, the great comfort</li>
  <li>That I have had of thee!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PAULINA</li>
  <li>What, sovereign sir,</li>
  <li>I did not well I meant well. All my services</li>
  <li class="number">You have paid home: but that you have vouchsafed,</li>
  <li>With your crown'd brother and these your contracted</li>
  <li>Heirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit,</li>
  <li>It is a surplus of your grace, which never</li>
  <li>My life may last to answer.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LEONTES</li>
  <li class="number">O Paulina,</li>
  <li>We honour you with trouble: but we came</li>
  <li>To see the statue of our queen: your gallery</li>
  <li>Have we pass'd through, not without much content</li>
  <li>In many singularities; but we saw not</li>
  <li class="number">That which my daughter came to look upon,</li>
  <li>The statue of her mother.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PAULINA</li>
  <li>As she lived peerless,</li>
  <li>So her dead likeness, I do well believe,</li>
  <li>Excels whatever yet you look'd upon</li>
  <li class="number">Or hand of man hath done; therefore I keep it</li>
  <li>Lonely, apart. But here it is: prepare</li>
  <li>To see the life as lively mock'd as ever</li>
  <li>Still sleep mock'd death: behold, and say 'tis well.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">PAULINA draws a curtain, and discovers HERMIONE
standing like a statue</li>
  <li>I like your silence, it the more shows off</li>
  <li class="number">Your wonder: but yet speak; first, you, my liege,</li>
  <li>Comes it not something near?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LEONTES</li>
  <li>Her natural posture!</li>
  <li>Chide me, dear stone, that I may say indeed</li>
  <li>Thou art Hermione; or rather, thou art she</li>
  <li class="number">In thy not chiding, for she was as tender</li>
  <li>As infancy and grace. But yet, Paulina,</li>
  <li>Hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing</li>
  <li>So aged as this seems.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POLIXENES</li>
  <li>O, not by much.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PAULINA</li>
  <li class="number">So much the more our carver's excellence;</li>
  <li>Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her</li>
  <li>As she lived now.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LEONTES</li>
  <li>As now she might have done,</li>
  <li>So much to my good comfort, as it is</li>
  <li class="number">Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,</li>
  <li>Even with such life of majesty, warm life,</li>
  <li>As now it coldly stands, when first I woo'd her!</li>
  <li>I am ashamed: does not the stone rebuke me</li>
  <li>For being more stone than it? O royal piece,</li>
  <li class="number">There's magic in thy majesty, which has</li>
  <li>My evils conjured to remembrance and</li>
  <li>From thy admiring daughter took the spirits,</li>
  <li>Standing like stone with thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PERDITA</li>
  <li>And give me leave,</li>
  <li class="number">And do not say 'tis superstition, that</li>
  <li>I kneel and then implore her blessing. Lady,</li>
  <li>Dear queen, that ended when I but began,</li>
  <li>Give me that hand of yours to kiss.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PAULINA</li>
  <li>O, patience!</li>
  <li class="number">The statue is but newly fix'd, the colour's Not dry.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAMILLO</li>
  <li>My lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,</li>
  <li>Which sixteen winters cannot blow away,</li>
  <li>So many summers dry; scarce any joy</li>
  <li>Did ever so long live; no sorrow</li>
  <li class="number">But kill'd itself much sooner.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POLIXENES</li>
  <li>Dear my brother,</li>
  <li>Let him that was the cause of this have power</li>
  <li>To take off so much grief from you as he</li>
  <li>Will piece up in himself.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PAULINA</li>
  <li class="number">Indeed, my lord,</li>
  <li>If I had thought the sight of my poor image</li>
  <li>Would thus have wrought you —  for the stone is mine — </li>
  <li>I'ld not have show'd it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LEONTES</li>
  <li>Do not draw the curtain.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PAULINA</li>
  <li class="number">No longer shall you gaze on't, lest your fancy</li>
  <li>May think anon it moves.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LEONTES</li>
  <li>Let be, let be.</li>
  <li>Would I were dead, but that, methinks, already — </li>
  <li>What was he that did make it? See, my lord,</li>
  <li class="number">Would you not deem it breathed? and that those veins</li>
  <li>Did verily bear blood?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POLIXENES</li>
  <li>Masterly done:</li>
  <li>The very life seems warm upon her lip.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LEONTES</li>
  <li>The fixture of her eye has motion in't,</li>
  <li class="number">As we are mock'd with art.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PAULINA</li>
  <li>I'll draw the curtain:</li>
  <li>My lord's almost so far transported that</li>
  <li>He'll think anon it lives.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LEONTES</li>
  <li>O sweet Paulina,</li>
  <li class="number">Make me to think so twenty years together!</li>
  <li>No settled senses of the world can match</li>
  <li>The pleasure of that madness. Let 't alone.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PAULINA</li>
  <li>I am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirr'd you: but</li>
  <li>I could afflict you farther.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LEONTES</li>
  <li class="number">Do, Paulina;</li>
  <li>For this affliction has a taste as sweet</li>
  <li>As any cordial comfort. Still, methinks,</li>
  <li>There is an air comes from her: what fine chisel</li>
  <li>Could ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me,</li>
  <li class="number">For I will kiss her.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PAULINA</li>
  <li>Good my lord, forbear:</li>
  <li>The ruddiness upon her lip is wet;</li>
  <li>You'll mar it if you kiss it, stain your own</li>
  <li>With oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LEONTES</li>
  <li class="number">No, not these twenty years.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PERDITA</li>
  <li>So long could I</li>
  <li>Stand by, a looker on.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PAULINA</li>
  <li>Either forbear,</li>
  <li>Quit presently the chapel, or resolve you</li>
  <li class="number">For more amazement. If you can behold it,</li>
  <li>I'll make the statue move indeed, descend</li>
  <li>And take you by the hand; but then you'll think — </li>
  <li>Which I protest against — I am assisted</li>
  <li>By wicked powers.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LEONTES</li>
  <li class="number">What you can make her do,</li>
  <li>I am content to look on: what to speak,</li>
  <li>I am content to hear; for 'tis as easy</li>
  <li>To make her speak as move.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PAULINA</li>
  <li>It is required</li>
  <li class="number">You do awake your faith. Then all stand still;</li>
  <li>On: those that think it is unlawful business</li>
  <li>I am about, let them depart.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LEONTES</li>
  <li>Proceed:</li>
  <li>No foot shall stir.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PAULINA</li>
  <li class="number">Music, awake her; strike!</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Music</li>
  <li>'Tis time; descend; be stone no more; approach;</li>
  <li>Strike all that look upon with marvel. Come,</li>
  <li>I'll fill your grave up: stir, nay, come away,</li>
  <li>Bequeath to death your numbness, for from him</li>
  <li class="number">Dear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs:</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">HERMIONE comes down</li>
  <li>Start not; her actions shall be holy as</li>
  <li>You hear my spell is lawful: do not shun her</li>
  <li>Until you see her die again; for then</li>
  <li>You kill her double. Nay, present your hand:</li>
  <li class="number">When she was young you woo'd her; now in age</li>
  <li>Is she become the suitor?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LEONTES</li>
  <li>O, she's warm!</li>
  <li>If this be magic, let it be an art</li>
  <li>Lawful as eating.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POLIXENES</li>
  <li class="number">She embraces him.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CAMILLO</li>
  <li>She hangs about his neck:</li>
  <li>If she pertain to life let her speak too.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POLIXENES</li>
  <li>Ay, and make't manifest where she has lived,</li>
  <li>Or how stolen from the dead.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PAULINA</li>
  <li class="number">That she is living,</li>
  <li>Were it but told you, should be hooted at</li>
  <li>Like an old tale: but it appears she lives,</li>
  <li>Though yet she speak not. Mark a little while.</li>
  <li>Please you to interpose, fair madam: kneel</li>
  <li class="number">And pray your mother's blessing. Turn, good lady;</li>
  <li>Our Perdita is found.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HERMIONE</li>
  <li>You gods, look down</li>
  <li>And from your sacred vials pour your graces</li>
  <li>Upon my daughter's head! Tell me, mine own.</li>
  <li class="number">Where hast thou been preserved? where lived? how found</li>
  <li>Thy father's court? for thou shalt hear that I,</li>
  <li>Knowing by Paulina that the oracle</li>
  <li>Gave hope thou wast in being, have preserved</li>
  <li>Myself to see the issue.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PAULINA</li>
  <li class="number">There's time enough for that;</li>
  <li>Lest they desire upon this push to trouble</li>
  <li>Your joys with like relation. Go together,</li>
  <li>You precious winners all; your exultation</li>
  <li>Partake to every one. I, an old turtle,</li>
  <li class="number">Will wing me to some wither'd bough and there</li>
  <li>My mate, that's never to be found again,</li>
  <li>Lament till I am lost.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LEONTES</li>
  <li>O, peace, Paulina!</li>
  <li>Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent,</li>
  <li class="number">As I by thine a wife: this is a match,</li>
  <li>And made between's by vows. Thou hast found mine;</li>
  <li>But how, is to be question'd; for I saw her,</li>
  <li>As I thought, dead, and have in vain said many</li>
  <li>A prayer upon her grave. I'll not seek far — </li>
  <li class="number">For him, I partly know his mind — to find thee</li>
  <li>An honourable husband. Come, Camillo,</li>
  <li>And take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty</li>
  <li>Is richly noted and here justified</li>
  <li>By us, a pair of kings. Let's from this place.</li>
  <li class="number">What! look upon my brother: both your pardons,</li>
  <li>That e'er I put between your holy looks</li>
  <li>My ill suspicion. This is your son-in-law,</li>
  <li>And son unto the king, who, heavens directing,</li>
  <li>Is troth-plight to your daughter. Good Paulina,</li>
  <li class="number">Lead us from hence, where we may leisurely</li>
  <li>Each one demand an answer to his part</li>
  <li>Perform'd in this wide gap of time since first</li>
  <li>We were dissever'd: hastily lead away.</li>
