  <li data-number="20">Renowmed Lucius, from our troops I stray’d</li>
  <li>To gaze upon a ruinous monastery,</li>

  <li>I heard a child cry underneath a wall.</li>

  <li data-number="30">Villain, thou mightst have been an emperor.</li>

  <li>Well, let my deeds be witness of my worth:</li>
  <li>I train’d thy brethren to that guileful hole,</li>
  <li data-number="105">Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay;</li>
  <li>I wrote the letter that thy father found,</li>

  <li>And what not done, that thou hast cause to rue,</li>
  <li data-number="110">Wherein I had no stroke of mischief in it?</li>
  <li>I play’d the cheater for thy father’s hand,</li>
  <li>And when I had it, drew myself apart,</li>
  <li>And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter.</li>
  <li>I pried me through the crevice of a wall,</li>
  <li data-number="115">When, for his hand, he had his two sons’ heads,</li>
  <li>Beheld his tears, and laugh’d so heartily</li>
  <li>That both mine eyes were rainy like to his;</li>
  <li>And when I told the Empress of this sport,</li>
  <li>She sounded almost at my pleasing tale,</li>
  <li data-number="120">And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses.</li>

  <li>Ravish a maid, or plot the way to do it,</li>
  <li data-number="130">Accuse some innocent, and forswear myself,</li>
  <li>Set deadly enmity between two friends,</li>
  <li>Make poor men’s cattle break their necks,</li>
  <li>Set fire on barns and haystalks in the night,</li>
  <li>And bid the owners quench them with their tears.</li>
  <li data-number="135">Oft have I digg’d up dead men from their graves,</li>
  <li>And set them upright at their dear friends’ door,</li>
  <li>Even when their sorrows almost was forgot,</li>
  <li>And on their skins, as on the bark of trees,</li>
  <li>Have with my knife carved in Roman letters,</li>
  <li data-number="140">“Let not your sorrow die, though I am dead.”</li>
  <li>But I have done a thousand dreadful things,</li>

  <li>Lastly, myself unkindly banished,</li>
  <li data-number="105">The gates shut on me, and turn’d weeping out</li>

  <li>I am the turned forth, be it known to you,</li>
  <li data-number="110">That have preserv’d her welfare in my blood,</li>

  <li>My scars can witness, dumb although they are,</li>
  <li data-number="115">That my report is just and full of truth.</li>
