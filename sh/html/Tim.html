  <li>Good day, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAIN.">
  <li data-offset="3">I am glad y’ are well.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POET.">
  <li>I have not seen you long, how goes the world?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAIN.">
  <li>It wears, sir, as it grows.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POET.">
  <li data-offset="5">Ay, that’s well known;</li>
  <li>But what particular rarity? What strange,</li>
  <li data-number="5">Which manifold record not matches? See,</li>
  <li>Magic of bounty! All these spirits thy power</li>
  <li>Hath conjur’d to attend. I know the merchant.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAIN.">
  <li>I know them both; th’ other’s a jeweler.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MER.">
  <li>O, ’tis a worthy lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JEW.">
  <li data-offset="4">Nay, that’s most fix’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MER.">
  <li data-number="10">A most incomparable man, breath’d, as it were,</li>
  <li>To an untirable and continuate goodness;</li>
  <li>He passes.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JEW.">
  <li>I have a jewel here—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MER.">
  <li>O, pray let’s see’t. For the Lord Timon, sir?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JEW.">
  <li data-number="15">If he will touch the estimate. But for that—</li>

</li>
  <li data-offset="6">’Tis a good form.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JEW.">
  <li>And rich. Here is a water, look ye.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAIN.">
  <li>You are rapt, sir, in some work, some dedication</li>
  <li>To the great lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POET.">
  <li data-offset="4">A thing slipp’d idlely from me.</li>
  <li>Our poesy is as a gum, which oozes</li>
  <li>From whence ’tis nourish’d. The fire i’ th’ flint</li>
  <li>Shows not till it be struck; our gentle flame</li>
  <li data-number="25">Provokes itself and like the current flies</li>
  <li>Each bound it chases. What have you there?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAIN.">
  <li>A picture, sir. When comes your book forth?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POET.">
  <li>Upon the heels of my presentment, sir.</li>
  <li>Let’s see your piece.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAIN.">
  <li data-offset="4">’Tis a good piece.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POET.">
  <li>So ’tis. This comes off well and excellent.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAIN.">
  <li>Indifferent.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POET.">
  <li data-offset="3">Admirable! How this grace</li>
  <li>Speaks his own standing! What a mental power</li>
  <li>This eye shoots forth! How big imagination</li>
  <li>Moves in this lip! To th’ dumbness of the gesture</li>
  <li data-number="35">One might interpret.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAIN.">
  <li>It is a pretty mocking of the life.</li>
  <li>Here is a touch; is’t good?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POET.">
  <li data-offset="5">I will say of it,</li>
  <li>It tutors nature. Artificial strife</li>
  <li>Lives in these touches, livelier than life.</li>

<ol data-speaker="PAIN.">
  <li data-number="40">How this lord is followed!</li>

<ol data-speaker="POET.">
  <li>The senators of Athens, happy men!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAIN.">
  <li>Look, more!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POET.">
  <li>You see this confluence, this great flood of visitors.</li>
  <li>I have, in this rough work, shap’d out a man</li>
  <li data-number="45">Whom this beneath world doth embrace and hug</li>
  <li>With amplest entertainment. My free drift</li>
  <li>Halts not particularly, but moves itself</li>
  <li>In a wide sea of wax; no levell’d malice</li>
  <li>Infects one comma in the course I hold,</li>
  <li data-number="50">But flies an eagle flight, bold, and forth on,</li>
  <li>Leaving no tract behind.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAIN.">
  <li>How shall I understand you?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POET.">
  <li data-offset="6">I will unbolt to you.</li>
  <li>You see how all conditions, how all minds,</li>
  <li>As well of glib and slipp’ry creatures as</li>
  <li data-number="55">Of grave and austere quality, tender down</li>
  <li>Their services to Lord Timon. His large fortune,</li>
  <li>Upon his good and gracious nature hanging,</li>
  <li>Subdues and properties to his love and tendance</li>
  <li>All sorts of hearts; yea, from the glass-fac’d flatterer</li>
  <li data-number="60">To Apemantus, that few things loves better</li>
  <li>Than to abhor himself; even he drops down</li>
  <li>The knee before him, and returns in peace</li>
  <li>Most rich in Timon’s nod.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAIN.">
  <li data-offset="5">I saw them speak together.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POET.">
  <li>Sir, I have upon a high and pleasant hill</li>
  <li data-number="65">Feign’d Fortune to be thron’d. The base o’ th’ mount</li>
  <li>Is rank’d with all deserts, all kind of natures,</li>
  <li>That labor on the bosom of this sphere</li>
  <li>To propagate their states. Amongst them all,</li>
  <li>Whose eyes are on this sovereign lady fix’d,</li>
  <li data-number="70">One do I personate of Lord Timon’s frame,</li>
  <li>Whom Fortune with her ivory hand wafts to her,</li>
  <li>Whose present grace to present slaves and servants</li>
  <li>Translates his rivals.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAIN.">
  <li data-offset="4">’Tis conceiv’d to scope.</li>
  <li>This throne, this Fortune, and this hill, methinks,</li>
  <li data-number="75">With one man beckon’d from the rest below,</li>
  <li>Bowing his head against the steepy mount</li>
  <li>To climb his happiness, would be well express’d</li>
  <li>In our condition.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POET.">
  <li data-offset="4">Nay, sir, but hear me on:</li>
  <li>All those which were his fellows but of late—</li>
  <li data-number="80">Some better than his value—on the moment</li>
  <li>Follow his strides, his lobbies fill with tendance,</li>
  <li>Rain sacrificial whisperings in his ear,</li>
  <li>Make sacred even his stirrup, and through him</li>
  <li>Drink the free air.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAIN.">
  <li data-offset="4">Ay, marry, what of these?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POET.">
  <li data-number="85">When Fortune in her shift and change of mood</li>
  <li>Spurns down her late beloved, all his dependents</li>
  <li>Which labor’d after him to the mountain’s top</li>
  <li>Even on their knees and hands, let him slip down,</li>
  <li>Not one accompanying his declining foot.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAIN.">
  <li data-number="90">’Tis common:</li>
  <li>A thousand moral paintings I can show</li>
  <li>That shall demonstrate these quick blows of Fortune’s</li>
  <li>More pregnantly than words. Yet you do well</li>
  <li>To show Lord Timon that mean eyes have seen</li>
  <li>The foot above the head.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">

  <li>Ay, my good lord, five talents is his debt,</li>
  <li>His means most short, his creditors most strait.</li>
  <li>Your honorable letter he desires</li>

  <li data-number="100" data-offset="4">Noble Ventidius! Well;</li>
  <li>I am not of that feather to shake off</li>
  <li>My friend when he must need me. I do know him</li>

  <li>Lord Timon, hear me speak.</li>

  <li>Thou hast a servant nam’d Lucilius.</li>

  <li>I have so. What of him?</li>

  <li>Most noble Timon, call the man before thee.</li>

  <li>Here, at your lordship’s service.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OLD ATH.">
  <li>This fellow here, Lord Timon, this thy creature,</li>
  <li>By night frequents my house. I am a man</li>
  <li>That from my first have been inclin’d to thrift,</li>
  <li>And my estate deserves an heir more rais’d</li>
  <li>Than one which holds a trencher.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIM.">
  <li data-offset="7">Well; what further?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OLD ATH.">
  <li>One only daughter have I, no kin else,</li>
  <li>On whom I may confer what I have got.</li>
  <li>The maid is fair, a’ th’ youngest for a bride,</li>
  <li data-number="125">And I have bred her at my dearest cost</li>
  <li>In qualities of the best. This man of thine</li>
  <li>Attempts her love. I prithee, noble lord,</li>
  <li>Join with me to forbid him her resort,</li>
  <li>Myself have spoke in vain.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIM.">
  <li data-offset="5">The man is honest.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OLD ATH.">
  <li data-number="130">Therefore he will be, Timon.</li>
  <li>His honesty rewards him in itself,</li>
  <li>It must not bear my daughter.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIM.">
  <li data-offset="6">Does she love him?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OLD ATH.">
  <li>She is young and apt.</li>

  <li>Ay, my good lord, and she accepts of it.</li>

<ol data-speaker="OLD ATH.">
  <li>If in her marriage my consent be missing,</li>
  <li>I call the gods to witness, I will choose</li>

  <li data-number="140" data-offset="4">How shall she be endowed,</li>

  <li>This gentleman of mine hath serv’d me long;</li>
  <li>To build his fortune I will strain a little,</li>

<ol data-speaker="PAIN.">
  <li>A piece of painting, which I do beseech</li>
  <li>Your lordship to accept.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIM.">
  <li data-offset="5">Painting is welcome.</li>
  <li>The painting is almost the natural man;</li>
  <li>For since dishonor traffics with man’s nature,</li>
  <li data-number="160">He is but outside; these pencill’d figures are</li>
  <li>Even such as they give out. I like your work,</li>

  <li>Well fare you, gentleman; give me your hand,</li>

<ol data-speaker="JEW.">
  <li data-offset="5">What, my lord, dispraise?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIM.">
  <li>A mere satiety of commendations;</li>
  <li>If I should pay you for’t as ’tis extoll’d,</li>
  <li>It would unclew me quite.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JEW.">
  <li data-offset="5">My lord, ’tis rated</li>
  <li data-number="170">As those which sell would give; but you well know,</li>

  <li>Yes.</li>

<ol data-speaker="TIM.">
  <li data-number="190">Whither art going?</li>

  <li>To knock out an honest Athenian’s brains.</li>

  <li>That’s a deed thou’t die for.</li>

  <li data-number="195">The best, for the innocence.</li>

<ol data-speaker="APEM.">
  <li>He wrought better that made the painter, and yet he’s but a filthy piece of work.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAIN.">
  <li>Y’ are a dog.</li>

<ol data-speaker="APEM.">
  <li>Thy mother’s of my generation; what’s she, if I be a dog?</li>

<ol data-speaker="TIM.">
  <li data-number="200">Wilt dine with me, Apemantus?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="APEM.">
  <li>No; I eat not lords.</li>

<ol data-speaker="TIM.">
  <li>And thou shouldst, thou’dst anger ladies.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="APEM.">
  <li>O, they eat lords; so they come by great bellies.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIM.">
  <li>That’s a lascivious apprehension.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="APEM.">
  <li data-number="205">So thou apprehend’st it, take it for thy labor.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIM.">
  <li>How dost thou like this jewel, Apemantus?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="APEM.">
  <li>Not so well as plain-dealing, which will not cast a man a doit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIM.">
  <li>What dost thou think ’tis worth?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="APEM.">
  <li>Not worth my thinking. How now, poet?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POET.">
  <li data-number="210">How now, philosopher?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="APEM.">
  <li>Thou liest.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POET.">
  <li>Art not one?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="APEM.">
  <li>Yes.</li>

  <li>Then thou liest: look in thy last work, where thou hast feign’d him a worthy fellow.</li>

<ol data-speaker="POET.">
  <li>That’s not feign’d, he is so.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="APEM.">
  <li>Yes, he is worthy of thee, and to pay thee for thy labor. He that loves to be flatter’d is worthy o’ th’ flatterer. Heavens, that I were a lord!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIM.">
  <li data-number="220">What wouldst do then, Apemantus?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="APEM.">
  <li>E’en as Apemantus does now: hate a lord with my heart.</li>

<ol data-speaker="TIM.">
  <li>What, thyself?</li>

<ol data-speaker="APEM.">
  <li>Ay.</li>

<ol data-speaker="TIM.">
  <li>Wherefore?</li>

<ol data-speaker="APEM.">
  <li data-number="225">That I had no angry wit to be a lord. Art not thou a merchant?</li>

  <li>I scorn thy meat, ’twould choke me; for I should ne’er flatter thee. O you gods! What a number of men eats Timon, and he sees ’em not! It grieves me to see so many dip their meat in one man’s blood, and all the madness is, he cheers them up too.</li>
  <li>I wonder men dare trust themselves with men.</li>
  <li>Methinks they should invite them without knives:</li>
  <li>Good for their meat, and safer for their lives.</li>
  <li data-number="40">There’s much example for’t: the fellow that sits next him, now parts bread with him, pledges the breath of him in a divided draught, is the readiest man to kill him; ’t ’as been prov’d. If I were a huge man, I should fear to drink at meals,</li>

  <li>O, no doubt, my good friends, but the gods themselves have provided that I shall have much help from you: how had you been my friends else? Why have you that charitable title from thousands, did not you chiefly belong to my heart? I have told more of you to myself than you can with modesty speak in your own behalf; and thus far I confirm you. O you gods, think I, what need we have any friends, if we should ne’er have need of ’em? They were the most needless creatures living, should we ne’er have use for ’em; and would most resemble sweet instruments hung up in cases, that keeps their sounds to themselves. Why, I have often wish’d myself poorer, that I might come nearer to you. We are born to do benefits; and what better or properer can we call our own than the riches of our friends? O, what a precious comfort ’tis to have so many like brothers commanding one another’s fortunes! O, joy’s e’en made away ere’t can be born! Mine eyes cannot hold out water, methinks. To forget their faults, I drink to you.</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCUL.">
  <li>La, la, la, la! “nothing doubting,” says he? Alas, good lord! A noble gentleman ’tis, if he would not keep so good a house. Many a time and often I ha’ din’d with him, and told him on’t, and come again to supper to him of purpose to have him spend less, and yet he would embrace no counsel, take no warning by my coming.

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li>Who, the Lord Timon? He is my very good friend, and an honorable gentleman.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. STRAN.">
  <li>We know him for no less, though we are but strangers to him. But I can tell you one thing, my lord, and which I hear from common rumors, now Lord Timon’s happy hours are done and past, and his estate shrinks from him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li>Fie, no, do not believe it; he cannot want for money.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. STRAN.">
  <li>But believe you this, my lord, that not long ago one of his men was with the Lord Lucullus to borrow so many talents, nay, urg’d extremely for’t, and show’d what necessity belong’d to’t, and yet was denied.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li data-number="5">How?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. STRAN.">
  <li>I tell you, denied, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li>What a strange case was that! Now before the gods, I am asham’d on’t. Denied that honorable man? There was very little honor show’d in’t. For my own part, I must needs confess, I have receiv’d some small kindnesses from him, as money, plate, jewels, and such like trifles—nothing comparing to his—yet had he mistook him and sent to me, I should ne’er have denied his occasion so many talents.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li>Servilius? You are kindly met, sir. Fare thee well, commend me to thy honorable virtuous lord, my very exquisite friend.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SER.">
  <li data-number="10">May it please your honor, my lord hath sent—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li>Ha? What has he sent? I am so much endear’d to that lord: he’s ever sending. How shall I thank him, think’st thou? And what has he sent now?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SER.">
  <li>H’as only sent his present occasion now, my lord; requesting your lordship to supply his instant use with so many talents.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li>I know his lordship is but merry with me;</li>
  <li>He cannot want fifty—five hundred talents.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SER.">
  <li data-number="15">But in the mean time he wants less, my lord.</li>
  <li>If his occasion were not virtuous,</li>
  <li>I should not urge it half so faithfully.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li>Dost thou speak seriously, Servilius?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SER.">
  <li>Upon my soul, ’tis true, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li data-number="20">What a wicked beast was I to disfurnish myself against such a good time, when I might ha’ shown myself honorable! How unluckily it happ’ned that I should purchase the day before for a little part, and undo a great deal of honor! Servilius, now before the gods, I am not able to do (the more beast, I say!)—I was sending to use Lord Timon myself, these gentlemen can witness; but I would not, for the wealth of Athens, I had done’t now. Commend me bountifully to his good lordship, and I hope his honor will conceive the fairest of me, because I have no power to be kind. And tell him this from me, I count it one of my greatest afflictions, say, that I cannot pleasure such an honorable gentleman. Good Servilius, will you befriend me so far as to use mine own words to him?</li>
</ol>

  <li>Yes, sir, I shall.</li>

<ol data-speaker="1. STRAN.">
  <li>Why, this is the world’s soul, and just of the same piece</li>
  <li>Is every flatterer’s sport. Who can call him</li>
  <li>His friend that dips in the same dish? For, in</li>
  <li>My knowing, Timon has been this lord’s father,</li>
  <li data-number="30">And kept his credit with his purse;</li>
  <li>Supported his estate, nay, Timon’s money</li>
  <li>Has paid his men their wages. He ne’er drinks</li>
  <li>But Timon’s silver treads upon his lip,</li>
  <li>And yet—O, see the monstrousness of man</li>
  <li data-number="35">When he looks out in an ungrateful shape!—</li>
  <li>He does deny him (in respect of his)</li>
  <li>What charitable men afford to beggars.</li>
</ol>

  <li>Religion groans at it.</li>

  <li>To mark me for his friend; yet, I protest,</li>
  <li>For his right noble mind, illustrious virtue,</li>

  <li>Had his necessity made use of me,</li>

<ol data-speaker="1. SEN.">
  <li>My lord, you have my voice to’t; the fault’s</li>
  <li>Bloody; ’tis necessary he should die.</li>
  <li>Nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. SEN.">
  <li>Most true; the law shall bruise ’em.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALCIB.">
  <li data-number="5">Honor, health, and compassion to the Senate!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. SEN.">
  <li>Now, captain?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALCIB.">
  <li>I am an humble suitor to your virtues;</li>
  <li>For pity is the virtue of the law,</li>
  <li>And none but tyrants use it cruelly.</li>
  <li data-number="10">It pleases time and fortune to lie heavy</li>
  <li>Upon a friend of mine, who in hot blood</li>
  <li>Hath stepp’d into the law, which is past depth</li>
  <li>To those that (without heed) do plunge into’t.</li>
  <li>He is a man (setting his fate aside)</li>
  <li data-number="15">Of comely virtues;</li>
  <li>Nor did he soil the fact with cowardice</li>
  <li>(An honor in him which buys out his fault),</li>
  <li>But with a noble fury and fair spirit,</li>
  <li>Seeing his reputation touch’d to death,</li>
  <li data-number="20">He did oppose his foe;</li>
  <li>And with such sober and unnoted passion</li>
  <li>He did behoove his anger, ere ’twas spent,</li>
  <li>As if he had but prov’d an argument.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. SEN.">
  <li>You undergo too strict a paradox,</li>
  <li data-number="25">Striving to make an ugly deed look fair.</li>
  <li>Your words have took such pains as if they labor’d</li>
  <li>To bring manslaughter into form, and set quarreling</li>
  <li>Upon the head of valor; which indeed</li>
  <li>Is valor misbegot, and came into the world</li>
  <li data-number="30">When sects and factions were newly born.</li>
  <li>He’s truly valiant that can wisely suffer</li>
  <li>The worst that man can breathe, and make his wrongs</li>
  <li>His outsides, to wear them like his raiment, carelessly,</li>
  <li>And ne’er prefer his injuries to his heart,</li>
  <li data-number="35">To bring it into danger.</li>
  <li>If wrongs be evils and enforce us kill,</li>
  <li>What folly ’tis to hazard life for ill!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALCIB.">
  <li>My lord—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. SEN.">
  <li data-offset="2">You cannot make gross sins look clear;</li>
  <li>To revenge is no valor, but to bear.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALCIB.">
  <li data-number="40">My lords, then, under favor, pardon me</li>
  <li>If I speak like a captain.</li>
  <li>Why do fond men expose themselves to battle,</li>
  <li>And not endure all threats? Sleep upon’t,</li>
  <li>And let the foes quietly cut their throats</li>
  <li data-number="45">Without repugnancy? If there be</li>
  <li>Such valor in the bearing, what make we</li>
  <li>Abroad? Why then, women are more valiant</li>
  <li>That stay at home, if bearing carry it;</li>
  <li>And the ass more captain than the lion, the fellow</li>
  <li data-number="50">Loaden with irons wiser than the judge,</li>
  <li>If wisdom be in suffering. O my lords,</li>
  <li>As you are great, be pitifully good.</li>
  <li>Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood?</li>
  <li>To kill, I grant, is sin’s extremest gust,</li>
  <li data-number="55">But in defense, by mercy, ’tis most just.</li>
  <li>To be in anger is impiety;</li>
  <li>But who is man that is not angry?</li>
  <li>Weigh but the crime with this.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. SEN.">
  <li>You breathe in vain.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALCIB.">
  <li data-offset="4">In vain? His service done</li>
  <li data-number="60">At Lacedaemon and Byzantium</li>
  <li>Were a sufficient briber for his life.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. SEN.">
  <li>What’s that?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALCIB.">
  <li data-offset="3">Why, I say, my lords, h’as done fair service,</li>
  <li>And slain in fight many of your enemies.</li>
  <li>How full of valor did he bear himself</li>
  <li data-number="65">In the last conflict, and made plenteous wounds!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. SEN.">
  <li>He has made too much plenty with ’em.</li>
  <li>He’s a sworn rioter; he has a sin that often</li>
  <li>Drowns him and takes his valor prisoner.</li>
  <li>If there were no foes, that were enough</li>
  <li data-number="70">To overcome him. In that beastly fury</li>
  <li>He has been known to commit outrages</li>
  <li>And cherish factions. ’Tis inferr’d to us,</li>
  <li>His days are foul and his drink dangerous.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. SEN.">
  <li>He dies.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALCIB.">
  <li data-offset="2">Hard fate! He might have died in war.</li>
  <li data-number="75">My lords, if not for any parts in him—</li>
  <li>Though his right arm might purchase his own time</li>
  <li>And be in debt to none—yet more to move you,</li>
  <li>Take my deserts to his, and join ’em both;</li>
  <li>And for I know your reverend ages love</li>
  <li data-number="80">Security, I’ll pawn my victories, all</li>
  <li>My honor to you, upon his good returns.</li>
  <li>If by this crime he owes the law his life,</li>
  <li>Why, let the war receive’t in valiant gore,</li>
  <li>For law is strict, and war is nothing more.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. SEN.">
  <li data-number="85">We are for law, he dies, urge it no more</li>
  <li>On height of our displeasure. Friend, or brother,</li>
  <li>He forfeits his own blood that spills another.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALCIB.">
  <li>Must it be so? It must not be. My lords,</li>

<h3>Scene 1</h3>

<h4>The woods. Before Timon’s cave.</h4>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Poet and Painter; Timon watching them from his cave.
	
		TIM.
	
	
		POET.
		PAIN.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="PAIN.">
  <li>As I took note of the place, it cannot be far</li>
  <li>Where he abides.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POET.">
  <li data-offset="4">What’s to be thought of him?</li>
  <li>Does the rumor hold for true that he’s</li>
  <li>So full of gold?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAIN.">
  <li data-offset="3">Certain. Alcibiades reports it;</li>
  <li data-number="5">Phrynia and Timandra had gold of him.</li>
  <li>He likewise enrich’d poor straggling soldiers with</li>
  <li>Great quantity. ’Tis said he gave unto</li>
  <li>His steward a mighty sum.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POET.">
  <li data-offset="5">Then this breaking of his</li>
  <li>Has been but a try for his friends?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAIN.">
  <li data-offset="7">Nothing else.</li>
  <li data-number="10">You shall see him a palm in Athens again, and flourish</li>
  <li>With the highest. Therefore, ’tis not amiss</li>
  <li>We tender our loves to him in this suppos’d</li>
  <li>Distress of his; it will show honestly in us,</li>
  <li>And is very likely to load our purposes</li>
  <li data-number="15">With what they travail for, if it be</li>
  <li>A just and true report that goes of his having.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POET.">
  <li>What have you now to present unto him?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAIN.">
  <li>Nothing at this time but my visitation;</li>
  <li>Only I will promise him an excellent piece.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POET.">
  <li>I must serve him so too: tell him of an intent</li>
  <li>That’s coming toward him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAIN.">
  <li data-offset="5">Good as the best.</li>
  <li>Promising is the very air o’ th’ time;</li>
  <li>It opens the eyes of expectation.</li>
  <li>Performance is ever the duller for his act,</li>
  <li data-number="25">And but in the plainer and simpler kind of people</li>
  <li>The deed of saying is quite out of use.</li>
  <li>To promise is most courtly and fashionable;</li>
  <li>Performance is a kind of will or testament</li>
  <li>Which argues a great sickness in his judgment</li>
  <li data-number="30">That makes it.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Timon from his cave.
	
		TIM.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="TIM.">
  <li class="stage-direction">
	Aside.
	
		TIM.
	
</li>
  <li>Excellent workman! Thou canst not paint a man</li>
  <li>So bad as is thyself.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POET.">
  <li data-offset="4">I am thinking</li>
  <li>What I shall say I have provided for him.</li>
  <li>It must be a personating of himself;</li>
  <li data-number="35">A satire against the softness of prosperity,</li>
  <li>With a discovery of the infinite flatteries</li>
  <li>That follow youth and opulency.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIM.">
  <li class="stage-direction">
	Aside.
	
		TIM.
	
</li>
  <li data-offset="7">Must thou needs</li>
  <li>Stand for a villain in thine own work?</li>
  <li>Wilt thou whip thine own faults in other men?</li>
  <li>Do so, I have gold for thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POET.">
  <li data-number="40" data-offset="5">Nay, let’s seek him:</li>
  <li>Then do we sin against our own estate,</li>
  <li>When we may profit meet, and come too late.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAIN.">
  <li>True:</li>
  <li>When the day serves, before black-corner’d night,</li>
  <li data-number="45">Find what thou want’st by free and offer’d light.</li>
  <li>Come.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIM.">
  <li class="stage-direction">
	Aside.
	
		TIM.
	
</li>
  <li>I’ll meet you at the turn. What a god’s gold</li>
  <li>That he is worshipp’d in a baser temple</li>
  <li>Than where swine feed!</li>
  <li data-number="50">’Tis thou that rig’st the bark and plough’st the foam,</li>
  <li>Settlest admired reverence in a slave.</li>
  <li>To thee be worship, and thy saints for aye</li>
  <li>Be crown’d with plagues, that thee alone obey!</li>
  <li>Fit I meet them.</li>
</ol>

</div>

<ol data-speaker="POET.">
  <li>Hail, worthy Timon!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAIN.">
  <li data-number="55" data-offset="4">Our late noble master!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIM.">
  <li>Have I once liv’d to see two honest men?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POET.">
  <li>Sir,</li>
  <li>Having often of your open bounty tasted,</li>
  <li>Hearing you were retir’d, your friends fall’n off,</li>
  <li data-number="60">Whose thankless natures (O abhorred spirits!)</li>
  <li>Not all the whips of heaven are large enough—</li>
  <li>What, to you,</li>
  <li>Whose star-like nobleness gave life and influence</li>
  <li>To their whole being! I am rapt and cannot cover</li>
  <li data-number="65">The monstrous bulk of this ingratitude</li>
  <li>With any size of words.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIM.">
  <li>Let it go naked, men may see’t the better.</li>
  <li>You that are honest, by being what you are</li>
  <li>Make them best seen and known.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAIN.">
  <li data-offset="7">He and myself</li>
  <li>Have travail’d in the great show’r of your gifts,</li>
  <li>And sweetly felt it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIM.">
  <li data-offset="4">Ay, you are honest men.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAIN.">
  <li>We are hither come to offer you our service.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIM.">
  <li>Most honest men! Why, how shall I requite you?</li>
  <li>Can you eat roots and drink cold water? No?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOTH POET. AND PAIN.">
  <li data-number="75">What we can do, we’ll do, to do you service.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIM.">
  <li>Y’ are honest men; y’ have heard that I have gold,</li>
  <li>I am sure you have. Speak truth, y’ are honest men.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAIN.">
  <li>So it is said, my noble lord, but therefore</li>
  <li>Came not my friend nor I.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIM.">
  <li data-number="80">Good honest men! Thou draw’st a counterfeit</li>
  <li>Best in all Athens; th’ art indeed the best,</li>
  <li>Thou counterfeit’st most lively.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAIN.">
  <li data-offset="7">So, so, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIM.">
  <li>E’en so, sir, as I say.—And, for thy fiction,</li>
  <li>Why, thy verse swells with stuff so fine and smooth</li>
  <li data-number="85">That thou art even natural in thine art.</li>
  <li>But for all this, my honest-natur’d friends,</li>
  <li>I must needs say you have a little fault;</li>
  <li>Marry, ’tis not monstrous in you, neither wish I</li>
  <li>You take much pains to mend.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOTH POET. AND PAIN.">
  <li data-offset="6">Beseech your honor</li>
  <li>To make it known to us.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIM.">
  <li data-offset="5">You’ll take it ill.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOTH POET. AND PAIN.">
  <li>Most thankfully, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIM.">
  <li data-offset="5">Will you indeed?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOTH POET. AND PAIN.">
  <li>Doubt it not, worthy lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIM.">
  <li>There’s never a one of you but trusts a knave</li>
  <li>That mightily deceives you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOTH POET. AND PAIN.">
  <li data-offset="5">Do we, my lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIM.">
  <li data-number="95">Ay, and you hear him cog, see him dissemble,</li>
  <li>Know his gross patchery, love him, feed him,</li>
  <li>Keep in your bosom; yet remain assur’d</li>
  <li>That he’s a made-up villain.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAIN.">
  <li>I know none such, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POET.">
  <li data-offset="5">Nor I.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIM.">
  <li data-number="100">Look you, I love you well, I’ll give you gold,</li>
  <li>Rid me these villains from your companies;</li>
  <li>Hang them, or stab them, drown them in a draught,</li>
  <li>Confound them by some course, and come to me,</li>
  <li>I’ll give you gold enough.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOTH POET. AND PAIN.">
  <li data-number="105">Name them, my lord, let’s know them.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIM.">
  <li>You that way and you this; but two in company;</li>
  <li>Each man apart, all single and alone,</li>
  <li>Yet an arch-villain keeps him company.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">
	To one.
	
		TIM.
	
</li>
  <li>If where thou art, two villains shall not be,</li>
  <li data-number="110">Come not near him.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">
	To the other.
	
		TIM.
	
</li>
  <li>If thou wouldst not reside</li>
  <li>But where one villain is, then him abandon.—</li>
  <li>Hence, pack! There’s gold; you came for gold, ye slaves.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">
	To one.
	
		TIM.
	
</li>
  <li>You have work for me; there’s payment, hence!</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">
	To the other.
	
		TIM.
	
</li>
  <li data-number="115">You are an alcumist, make gold of that.</li>
  <li>Out, rascal dogs!</li>

	Enter Steward Flavius and two Senators.

		1. SEN.
		2. SEN.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="FLAV.">
  <li>It is vain that you would speak with Timon;</li>
  <li>For he is set so only to himself,</li>
  <li>That nothing but himself which looks like man</li>
  <li>Is friendly with him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. SEN.">
  <li data-number="120" data-offset="4">Bring us to his cave.</li>
  <li>It is our part and promise to th’ Athenians</li>
  <li>To speak with Timon.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. SEN.">
  <li data-offset="5">At all times alike</li>
  <li>Men are not still the same; ’twas time and griefs</li>
  <li>That fram’d him thus. Time with his fairer hand,</li>
  <li data-number="125">Offering the fortunes of his former days,</li>
  <li>The former man may make him. Bring us to him,</li>
  <li>And chance it as it may.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FLAV.">
  <li data-offset="5">Here is his cave.</li>
  <li>Peace and content be here! Lord Timon! Timon,</li>
  <li>Look out and speak to friends. Th’ Athenians</li>
  <li data-number="130">By two of their most reverend Senate greet thee.</li>
  <li>Speak to them, noble Timon.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Timon out of his cave.
	
		TIM.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="TIM.">
  <li>Thou sun that comforts, burn! Speak and be hang’d.</li>
  <li>For each true word, a blister, and each false</li>
  <li>Be as a cantherizing to the root o’ th’ tongue,</li>
  <li>Consuming it with speaking!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. SEN.">
  <li data-number="135" data-offset="6">Worthy Timon—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIM.">
  <li>Of none but such as you, and you of Timon.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. SEN.">
  <li>The senators of Athens greet thee, Timon.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIM.">
  <li>I thank them, and would send them back the plague,</li>
  <li>Could I but catch it for them.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. SEN.">
  <li data-offset="6">O, forget</li>
  <li data-number="140">What we are sorry for ourselves in thee.</li>
  <li>The senators with one consent of love</li>
  <li>Entreat thee back to Athens, who have thought</li>
  <li>On special dignities, which vacant lie,</li>
  <li>For thy best use and wearing.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. SEN.">
  <li data-offset="6">They confess</li>
  <li data-number="145">Toward thee forgetfulness too general gross;</li>
  <li>Which now the public body, which doth seldom</li>
  <li>Play the recanter, feeling in itself</li>
  <li>A lack of Timon’s aid, hath sense withal</li>
  <li>Of it own fall, restraining aid to Timon,</li>
  <li data-number="150">And send forth us to make their sorrowed render,</li>
  <li>Together with a recompense more fruitful</li>
  <li>Than their offense can weigh down by the dram;</li>
  <li>Ay, even such heaps and sums of love and wealth</li>
  <li>As shall to thee blot out what wrongs were theirs,</li>
  <li>And write in thee the figures of their love,</li>
  <li>Ever to read them thine.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIM.">
  <li data-offset="5">You witch me in it;</li>
  <li>Surprise me to the very brink of tears.</li>
  <li>Lend me a fool’s heart and a woman’s eyes,</li>
  <li>And I’ll beweep these comforts, worthy senators.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. SEN.">
  <li data-number="160">Therefore so please thee to return with us,</li>
  <li>And of our Athens, thine and ours, to take</li>
  <li>The captainship, thou shalt be met with thanks,</li>
  <li>Allow’d with absolute power, and thy good name</li>
  <li>Live with authority; so soon we shall drive back</li>
  <li data-number="165">Of Alcibiades th’ approaches wild,</li>
  <li>Who, like a boar too savage, doth root up</li>
  <li>His country’s peace.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. SEN.">
  <li data-offset="4">And shakes his threat’ning sword</li>
  <li>Against the walls of Athens.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. SEN.">
  <li data-offset="5">Therefore, Timon—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIM.">
  <li>Well, sir, I will; therefore I will, sir, thus:</li>
  <li data-number="170">If Alcibiades kill my countrymen,</li>
  <li>Let Alcibiades know this of Timon,</li>
  <li>That Timon cares not. But if he sack fair Athens,</li>
  <li>And take our goodly aged men by th’ beards,</li>
  <li>Giving our holy virgins to the stain</li>
  <li data-number="175">Of contumelious, beastly, mad-brain’d war,</li>
  <li>Then let him know, and tell him Timon speaks it,</li>
  <li>In pity of our aged and our youth,</li>
  <li>I cannot choose but tell him that I care not,</li>
  <li>And let him take’t at worst—for their knives care not,</li>
  <li data-number="180">While you have throats to answer. For myself,</li>
  <li>There’s not a whittle in th’ unruly camp</li>
  <li>But I do prize it at my love before</li>
  <li>The reverend’st throat in Athens. So I leave you</li>
  <li>To the protection of the prosperous gods,</li>
  <li>As thieves to keepers.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FLAV.">
  <li data-number="185" data-offset="4">Stay not, all’s in vain.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIM.">
  <li>Why, I was writing of my epitaph;</li>
  <li>It will be seen tomorrow. My long sickness</li>
  <li>Of health and living now begins to mend,</li>
  <li>And nothing brings me all things. Go, live still;</li>
  <li>Be Alcibiades your plague, you his,</li>
  <li>And last so long enough!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. SEN.">
  <li data-offset="5">We speak in vain.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIM.">
  <li>But yet I love my country, and am not</li>
  <li>One that rejoices in the common wrack,</li>
  <li>As common bruit doth put it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. SEN.">
  <li data-offset="6">That’s well spoke.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIM.">
  <li data-number="195">Commend me to my loving countrymen—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. SEN.">
  <li>These words become your lips as they pass thorough them.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. SEN.">
  <li>And enter in our ears like great triumphers</li>
  <li>In their applauding gates.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIM.">
  <li data-offset="5">Commend me to them,</li>
  <li>And tell them that, to ease them of their griefs,</li>
  <li data-number="200">Their fears of hostile strokes, their aches, losses,</li>
  <li>Their pangs of love, with other incident throes</li>
  <li>That nature’s fragile vessel doth sustain</li>
  <li>In life’s uncertain voyage, I will some kindness do them:</li>
  <li>I’ll teach them to prevent wild Alcibiades’ wrath.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. SEN.">
  <li data-number="205">I like this well, he will return again.</li>

<ol data-speaker="TIM.">
  <li>I have a tree, which grows here in my close,</li>
  <li>That mine own use invites me to cut down,</li>
  <li>And shortly must I fell it. Tell my friends,</li>
  <li>Tell Athens, in the sequence of degree,</li>
  <li data-number="210">From high to low throughout, that whoso please</li>
  <li>To stop affliction, let him take his haste,</li>
  <li>Come hither, ere my tree hath felt the axe,</li>
  <li>And hang himself. I pray you do my greeting.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FLAV.">
  <li>Trouble him no further, thus you still shall find him.</li>

<ol data-speaker="TIM.">
  <li data-number="215">Come not to me again, but say to Athens,</li>
  <li>Timon hath made his everlasting mansion</li>
  <li>Upon the beached verge of the salt flood,</li>
  <li>Who once a day with his embossed froth</li>
  <li>The turbulent surge shall cover; thither come,</li>
  <li data-number="220">And let my grave-stone be your oracle.</li>
  <li>Lips, let four words go by and language end!</li>
  <li>What is amiss, plague and infection mend!</li>
  <li>Graves only be men’s works, and death their gain!</li>

  <li>Till now you have gone on and fill’d the time</li>
  <li>With all licentious measure, making your wills</li>
  <li data-number="5">The scope of justice; till now myself and such</li>
  <li>As slept within the shadow of your power</li>
  <li>Have wander’d with our travers’d arms, and breath’d</li>
  <li>Our sufferance vainly. Now the time is flush,</li>
  <li>When crouching marrow in the bearer strong</li>
  <li data-number="10">Cries (of itself) “No more!” Now breathless wrong</li>
  <li>Shall sit and pant in your great chairs of ease,</li>
  <li>And pursy insolence shall break his wind</li>
  <li>With fear and horrid flight.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. SEN.">
  <li data-offset="5">Noble and young—</li>
  <li>When thy first griefs were but a mere conceit,</li>
  <li data-number="15">Ere thou hadst power or we had cause of fear,</li>
  <li>We sent to thee to give thy rages balm,</li>
  <li>To wipe out our ingratitude with loves</li>
  <li>Above their quantity.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. SEN.">
  <li data-offset="4">So did we woo</li>
  <li>Transformed Timon to our city’s love</li>
  <li data-number="20">By humble message and by promis’d means.</li>
  <li>We were not all unkind, nor all deserve</li>
  <li>The common stroke of war.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. SEN.">
  <li data-offset="5">These walls of ours</li>
  <li>Were not erected by their hands from whom</li>
  <li>You have receiv’d your grief; nor are they such</li>
  <li>That these great tow’rs, trophies, and schools should fall</li>
  <li>For private faults in them.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. SEN.">
  <li data-offset="5">Nor are they living</li>
  <li>Who were the motives that you first went out;</li>
  <li>Shame, that they wanted cunning in excess,</li>
  <li>Hath broke their hearts. March, noble lord,</li>
  <li data-number="30">Into our city with thy banners spread;</li>
  <li>By decimation, and a tithed death,</li>
  <li>If thy revenges hunger for that food</li>
  <li>Which nature loathes, take thou the destin’d tenth,</li>
  <li>And by the hazard of the spotted die</li>
  <li>Let die the spotted.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. SEN.">
  <li data-number="35" data-offset="4">All have not offended;</li>
  <li>For those that were, it is not square to take</li>
  <li>On those that are, revenge; crimes, like lands,</li>
  <li>Are not inherited. Then, dear countryman,</li>
  <li>Bring in thy ranks, but leave without thy rage;</li>
  <li data-number="40">Spare thy Athenian cradle and those kin</li>
  <li>Which in the bluster of thy wrath must fall</li>
  <li>With those that have offended; like a shepherd,</li>
  <li>Approach the fold and cull th’ infected forth,</li>
  <li>But kill not all together.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. SEN.">
  <li data-offset="5">What thou wilt,</li>
  <li>Thou rather shalt enforce it with thy smile</li>
  <li>Than hew to’t with thy sword.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. SEN.">
  <li data-offset="6">Set but thy foot</li>
  <li>Against our rampir’d gates and they shall ope,</li>
  <li>So thou wilt send thy gentle heart before,</li>
  <li>To say thou’t enter friendly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. SEN.">
  <li data-offset="5">Throw thy glove,</li>
  <li data-number="50">Or any token of thine honor else,</li>
  <li>That thou wilt use the wars as thy redress</li>
  <li>And not as our confusion, all thy powers</li>
  <li>Shall make their harbor in our town till we</li>
  <li>Have seal’d thy full desire.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALCIB.">
  <li data-offset="5">Then there’s my glove;</li>
  <li data-number="55">Descend, and open your uncharged ports.</li>
  <li>Those enemies of Timon’s and mine own</li>
  <li>Whom you yourselves shall set out for reproof</li>
  <li>Fall, and no more; and to atone your fears</li>
  <li>With my more noble meaning, not a man</li>
  <li data-number="60">Shall pass his quarter, or offend the stream</li>
  <li>Of regular justice in your city’s bounds,</li>
  <li>But shall be remedied to your public laws</li>
  <li>At heaviest answer.</li>
