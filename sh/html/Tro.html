<h3>Scene 1</h3>

<h4>Troy. Before Priam’s palace.</h4>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Pandarus and Troilus.
	
		PAN.
		TRO.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="TRO.">
  <li>Call here my varlet, I’ll unarm again.</li>
  <li>Why should I war without the walls of Troy,</li>
  <li>That find such cruel battle here within?</li>
  <li>Each Troyan that is master of his heart,</li>
  <li data-number="5">Let him to field, Troilus, alas, hath none.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li>Will this gear ne’er be mended?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRO.">
  <li>The Greeks are strong, and skillful to their strength,</li>
  <li>Fierce to their skill, and to their fierceness valiant,</li>
  <li>But I am weaker than a woman’s tear,</li>
  <li data-number="10">Tamer than sleep, fonder than ignorance,</li>
  <li>Less valiant than the virgin in the night,</li>
  <li>And skilless as unpractic’d infancy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li>Well, I have told you enough of this. For my part, I’ll not meddle nor make no farther. 
He that will have a cake out of the wheat must tarry the grinding.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRO.">
  <li>Have I not tarried?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li data-number="15">Ay, the grinding; but you must tarry the bolting.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRO.">
  <li>Have I not tarried?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li>Ay, the bolting; but you must tarry the leavening.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRO.">
  <li>Still have I tarried.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li>Ay, to the leavening, but here’s yet in the word “hereafter” the kneading, the making of the cake, the heating the oven, and the baking; nay, you must stay the cooling too, or ye may chance burn your lips.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRO.">
  <li data-number="20">Patience herself, what goddess e’er she be,</li>
  <li>Doth lesser blench at suff’rance than I do.</li>
  <li>At Priam’s royal table do I sit,</li>
  <li>And when fair Cressid comes into my thoughts—</li>
  <li>So, traitor, then she comes when she is thence.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li data-number="25">Well, she look’d yesternight fairer than ever</li>
  <li>I saw her look, or any woman else.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRO.">
  <li>I was about to tell thee—when my heart,</li>
  <li>As wedged with a sigh, would rive in twain,</li>
  <li>Lest Hector or my father should perceive me,</li>
  <li data-number="30">I have (as when the sun doth light a-scorn)</li>
  <li>Buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile,</li>
  <li>But sorrow that is couch’d in seeming gladness</li>
  <li>Is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li>And her hair were not somewhat darker than Helen’s—well, go to!—there were no more comparison between the women! 
But for my part, she is my kinswoman; I would not, as they term it, praise her, but I would somebody had heard her talk yesterday as I did. 
I will not dispraise your sister Cassandra’s wit, but—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRO.">
  <li data-number="35">O Pandarus! I tell thee, Pandarus—</li>
  <li>When I do tell thee there my hopes lie drown’d,</li>
  <li>Reply not in how many fathoms deep</li>
  <li>They lie indrench’d. I tell thee I am mad</li>
  <li>In Cressid’s love; thou answer’st she is fair,</li>
  <li data-number="40">Pourest in the open ulcer of my heart</li>
  <li>Her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice,</li>
  <li>Handiest in thy discourse, O, that her hand,</li>
  <li>In whose comparison all whites are ink</li>
  <li>Writing their own reproach; to whose soft seizure</li>
  <li data-number="45">The cygnet’s down is harsh, and spirit of sense</li>
  <li>Hard as the palm of ploughman. This thou tell’st me,</li>
  <li>As true thou tell’st me, when I say I love her,</li>
  <li>But saying thus, in stead of oil and balm,</li>
  <li>Thou lay’st in every gash that love hath given me</li>
  <li data-number="50">The knife that made it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li>I speak no more than truth.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRO.">
  <li>Thou dost not speak so much.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li>Faith, I’ll not meddle in it, let her be as she is; if she be fair, ’tis the better for her; and she be not, she has the mends in her own hands.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRO.">
  <li>Good Pandarus! How now, Pandarus?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li data-number="55">I have had my labor for my travail; ill thought on of her, and ill thought on of you; gone between and between, but small thanks for my labor.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRO.">
  <li>What, art thou angry, Pandarus? What, with me?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li>Because she’s kin to me, therefore she’s not so fair as Helen. And she were not kin to me, she would be as fair a’ 
Friday as Helen is on Sunday. But what care I? I care not and she were a blackamoor, ’tis all one to me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRO.">
  <li>Say I she is not fair?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li>I do not care whether you do or no. She’s a fool to stay behind her father, let her to the Greeks; and so I’ll tell her the next time I see her. 
For my part, I’ll meddle nor make no more i’ th’ matter.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRO.">
  <li data-number="60">Pandarus—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li>Not I.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRO.">
  <li>Sweet Pandarus—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li>Pray you speak no more to me, I will leave all as I found it, and there an end.</li>
</ol>

</div>

<ol data-speaker="TRO.">
  <li>Peace, you ungracious clamors! Peace, rude sounds!</li>
  <li data-number="65">Fools on both sides, Helen must needs be fair,</li>
  <li>When with your blood you daily paint her thus.</li>
  <li>I cannot fight upon this argument;</li>
  <li>It is too starv’d a subject for my sword.</li>
  <li>But Pandarus—O gods! How do you plague me!</li>
  <li data-number="70">I cannot come to Cressid but by Pandar,</li>
  <li>And he’s as tetchy to be woo’d to woo,</li>
  <li>As she is stubborn-chaste against all suit.</li>
  <li>Tell me, Apollo, for thy Daphne’s love,</li>
  <li>What Cressid is, what Pandar, and what we:</li>
  <li data-number="75">Her bed is India, there she lies, a pearl;</li>
  <li>Between our Ilium and where she resides,</li>
  <li>Let it be call’d the wild and wand’ring flood,</li>
  <li>Ourself the merchant, and this sailing Pandar</li>
  <li>Our doubtful hope, our convoy, and our bark.</li>

<ol data-speaker="TRO.">
  <li>Because not there. This woman’s answer sorts,</li>
  <li>For womanish it is to be from thence.</li>
  <li>What news, Aeneas, from the field today?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AENE.">
  <li>That Paris is returned home and hurt.</li>

<h3>Scene 2</h3>

<h4>Troy. A street.</h4>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Cressida and her man Alexander.
	
		CRES.
		ALEX.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li>Who were those went by?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALEX.">
  <li data-offset="5">Queen Hecuba and Helen.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li>And whither go they?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALEX.">
  <li data-offset="4">Up to the eastern tower,</li>
  <li>Whose height commands as subject all the vale,</li>
  <li>To see the battle. Hector, whose patience</li>
  <li data-number="5">Is as a virtue fix’d, today was mov’d:</li>
  <li>He chid Andromache and struck his armorer,</li>
  <li>And like as there were husbandry in war,</li>
  <li>Before the sun rose he was harness’d light,</li>
  <li>And to the field goes he; where every flower</li>
  <li>Did as a prophet weep what it foresaw</li>
  <li>In Hector’s wrath.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li data-offset="4">What was his cause of anger?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALEX.">
  <li>The noise goes, this: there is among the Greeks</li>
  <li>A lord of Troyan blood, nephew to Hector,</li>
  <li>They call him Ajax.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li data-offset="4">Good; and what of him?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALEX.">
  <li data-number="15">They say he is a very man <foreign xml:lang="la">per se</foreign> and stands alone.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li>So do all men, unless th’ are drunk, sick, or have no legs.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALEX.">
  <li>This man, lady, hath robb’d many beasts of their particular additions: he is as valiant as the lion, churlish as the bear, slow as the elephant; 
a man into whom nature hath so crowded humors that his valor is crush’d into folly, his folly sauc’d with discretion. There is no man hath a virtue that he hath not a glimpse of, nor any man an attaint but he carries some stain of it. He is melancholy without cause, and merry against the hair; he hath the joints of every thing, but every thing so out of joint that he is a gouty Briareus, many hands and no use, or purblind Argus, all eyes and no sight.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li>But how should this man, that makes me smile, make Hector angry?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALEX.">
  <li>They say he yesterday cop’d Hector in the battle and struck him down, the disdain and shame whereof hath ever since kept Hector fasting and waking.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Pandarus.
	
		PAN.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li data-number="20">Who comes here?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALEX.">
  <li>Madam, your uncle Pandarus.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li>Hector’s a gallant man.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALEX.">
  <li>As may be in the world, lady.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li>What’s that? What’s that?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li data-number="25">Good morrow, uncle Pandarus.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li>Good morrow, cousin Cressid. What do you talk of? Good morrow, Alexander. How do you, cousin? When were you at Ilium?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li>This morning, uncle.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li>What were you talking of when I came? Was Hector arm’d and gone ere ye came to Ilium? Helen was not up, was she?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li>Hector was gone, but Helen was not up.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li data-number="30">E’en so; Hector was stirring early.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li>That were we talking of, and of his anger.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li>Was he angry?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li>So he says here.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li>True, he was so; I know the cause too. He’ll lay about him today, I can tell them that, and there’s Troilus will not come far behind him. Let them take heed of Troilus; I can tell them that too.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li data-number="35">What, is he angry too?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li>Who, Troilus? Troilus is the better man of the two.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li>O Jupiter, there’s no comparison.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li>What, not between Troilus and Hector? Do you know a man if you see him?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li>Ay, if I ever saw him before and knew him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li data-number="40">Well, I say Troilus is Troilus.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li>Then you say as I say, for I am sure he is not Hector.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li>No, nor Hector is not Troilus in some degrees.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li>’Tis just to each of them; he is himself.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li>Himself? Alas, poor Troilus, I would he were!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li data-number="45">So he is.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li>Condition I had gone barefoot to India.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li>He is not Hector.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li>Himself? No! He’s not himself. Would ’a were himself! Well, the gods are above, time must friend or end. Well, Troilus, well, I would my heart were in her body. No, Hector is not a better man than Troilus.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li>Excuse me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li data-number="50">He is elder.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li>Pardon me, pardon me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li>Th’ other’s not come to’t. You shall tell me another tale when th’ other’s come to’t. 
Hector shall not have his wit this year.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li>He shall not need it if he have his own.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li>Nor his qualities.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li data-number="55">No matter.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li>Nor his beauty.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li>’Twould not become him, his own’s better.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li>You have no judgment, niece. Helen herself swore th’ other day that Troilus, for a brown favor (for so ’tis, I must confess)—not brown neither—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li>No, but brown.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li data-number="60">Faith, to say truth, brown and not brown.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li>To say the truth, true and not true.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li>She prais’d his complexion above Paris.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li>Why, Paris hath color enough.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li>So he has.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li data-number="65">Then Troilus should have too much: if she prais’d him above, his complexion is higher than his. He having color enough, and the other higher, is too flaming a praise for a good complexion. I had as lief Helen’s golden tongue had commended Troilus for a copper nose.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li>I swear to you, I think Helen loves him better than Paris.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li>Then she’s a merry Greek indeed.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li>Nay, I am sure she does. She came to him th’ other day into the compass’d window—and you know he has not past three or four hairs on his chin—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li>Indeed a tapster’s arithmetic may soon bring his particulars therein to a total.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li data-number="70">Why, he is very young, and yet will he, within three pound, lift as much as his brother Hector.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li>Is he so young a man and so old a lifter?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li>But to prove to you that Helen loves him: she came and puts me her white hand to his cloven chin—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li>Juno have mercy! How came it cloven?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li>Why, you know ’tis dimpled. I think his smiling becomes him better than any man in all Phrygia.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li data-number="75">O, he smiles valiantly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li>Does he not?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li>O yes, and ’twere a cloud in autumn.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li>Why, go to then. But to prove to you that Helen loves Troilus—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li>Troilus will stand to the proof, if you’ll prove it so.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li data-number="80">Troilus! Why, he esteems her no more than I esteem an addle egg.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li>If you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle head, you would eat chickens i’ th’ shell.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li>I cannot choose but laugh to think how she tickled his chin. Indeed she has a marvel’s white hand, I must needs confess.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li>Without the rack.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li>And she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li data-number="85">Alas, poor chin! Many a wart is richer.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li>But there was such laughing! Queen Hecuba laugh’d that her eyes ran o’er.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li>With millstones.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li>And Cassandra laugh’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li>But there was a more temperate fire under the pot of her eyes. Did her eyes run o’er too?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li data-number="90">And Hector laugh’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li>At what was all this laughing?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li>Marry, at the white hair that Helen spied on Troilus’ chin.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li>And’t had been a green hair, I should have laugh’d too.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li>They laugh’d not so much at the hair as at his pretty answer.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li data-number="95">What was his answer?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li>Quoth she, “Here’s but two and fifty hairs on your chin—and one of them is white.”</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li>This is her question.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li>That’s true, make no question of that. “Two and fifty hairs,” quoth he, “and one white. 
That white hair is my father, and all the rest are his sons.” “Jupiter,” quoth she, “which of these hairs is 
Paris my husband?” “The fork’d one,” quoth he, “pluck’t out, and give it him.” But there was such laughing! And Helen so blush’d, and Paris so chaf’d, and all the rest so laugh’d, that it pass’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li>So let it now, for it has been a great while going by.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li data-number="100">Well, cousin, I told you a thing yesterday, think on’t.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li>So I do.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">

  <li>Strength should be lord of imbecility,</li>

  <li>Force should be right, or rather, right and wrong</li>

  <li>’Tis like a chime a-mending, with terms unsquar’d,</li>
  <li data-number="160">Which from the tongue of roaring Typhon dropp’d</li>

  <li>Cries, “Excellent! ’Tis Agamemnon right!</li>
  <li data-number="165">Now play me Nestor, hem, and stroke thy beard,</li>
  <li>As he being dress’d to some oration.”</li>
  <li>That’s done, as near as the extremest ends</li>

  <li data-number="170">’Tis Nestor right. Now play him me, Patroclus,</li>
  <li>Arming to answer in a night alarm.”</li>
  <li>And then forsooth the faint defects of age</li>

  <li>And with a palsy fumbling on his gorget,</li>
  <li data-number="175">Shake in and out the rivet; and at this sport</li>

  <li data-number="260">We have, great Agamemnon, here in Troy</li>
  <li>A prince call’d Hector—Priam is his father—</li>
  <li>Who in this dull and long-continued truce</li>
  <li>Is resty grown. He bade me take a trumpet,</li>
  <li>And to this purpose speak: kings, princes, lords!</li>
  <li data-number="265">If there be one among the fair’st of Greece</li>
  <li>That holds his honor higher than his ease,</li>
  <li>And seeks his praise more than he fears his peril,</li>
  <li>That knows his valor, and knows not his fear,</li>
  <li>That loves his mistress more than in confession</li>
  <li data-number="270">With truant vows to her own lips he loves,</li>

  <li>Hector, in view of Troyans and of Greeks,</li>
  <li>Shall make it good, or do his best to do it:</li>
  <li data-number="275">He hath a lady, wiser, fairer, truer,</li>
  <li>Than ever Greek did couple in his arms,</li>
  <li>And will tomorrow with his trumpet call,</li>
  <li>Midway between your tents and walls of Troy,</li>
  <li>To rouse a Grecian that is true in love.</li>
  <li data-number="280">If any come, Hector shall honor him;</li>
  <li>If none, he’ll say in Troy when he retires,</li>
  <li>The Grecian dames are sunburnt, and not worth</li>
  <li>The splinter of a lance. Even so much.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AGAM.">
  <li>This shall be told our lovers, Lord Aeneas.</li>

  <li>A noble man that hath no spark of fire</li>
  <li data-number="295">To answer for his love, tell him from me</li>
  <li>I’ll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver,</li>

<ol data-speaker="NEST.">
  <li>What says Ulysses?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ULYSS.">
  <li>I have a young conception in my brain,</li>
  <li>Be you my time to bring it to some shape.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NEST.">
  <li>What is’t?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ULYSS.">
  <li data-number="315">This ’tis:</li>
  <li>Blunt wedges rive hard knots; the seeded pride</li>
  <li>That hath to this maturity blown up</li>
  <li>In rank Achilles must or now be cropp’d,</li>
  <li>Or shedding, breed a nursery of like evil,</li>
  <li>To overbulk us all.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NEST.">
  <li data-number="320" data-offset="4">Well, and how?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ULYSS.">
  <li>This challenge that the gallant Hector sends,</li>
  <li>However it is spread in general name,</li>
  <li>Relates in purpose only to Achilles.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NEST.">
  <li>True, the purpose is perspicuous as substance,</li>
  <li data-number="325">Whose grossness little characters sum up;</li>
  <li>And in the publication make no strain</li>
  <li>But that Achilles, were his brain as barren</li>
  <li>As banks of Libya (though, Apollo knows,</li>
  <li>’Tis dry enough), will with great speed of judgment,</li>
  <li data-number="330">Ay, with celerity, find Hector’s purpose</li>
  <li>Pointing on him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ULYSS.">
  <li>And wake him to the answer, think you?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NEST.">
  <li>Why, ’tis most meet; who may you else oppose</li>
  <li>That can from Hector bring those honors off,</li>
  <li data-number="335">If not Achilles? Though’t be a sportful combat,</li>
  <li>Yet in the trial much opinion dwells;</li>
  <li>For here the Troyans taste our dear’st repute</li>
  <li>With their fin’st palate; and trust to me, Ulysses,</li>
  <li>Our imputation shall be oddly pois’d</li>
  <li data-number="340">In this vild action, for the success,</li>
  <li>Although particular, shall give a scantling</li>
  <li>Of good or bad unto the general,</li>
  <li>And in such indexes (although small pricks</li>
  <li>To their subsequent volumes) there is seen</li>
  <li data-number="345">The baby figure of the giant mass</li>
  <li>Of things to come at large. It is suppos’d</li>
  <li>He that meets Hector issues from our choice,</li>
  <li>And choice (being mutual act of all our souls)</li>
  <li>Makes merit her election, and doth boil</li>
  <li data-number="350">(As ’twere from forth us all) a man distill’d</li>
  <li>Out of our virtues, who miscarrying,</li>
  <li>What heart receives from hence a conquering part</li>
  <li>To steel a strong opinion to themselves?</li>
  <li>Which entertain’d, limbs are his instruments,</li>
  <li>In no less working than are swords and bows</li>
  <li>Directive by the limbs.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ULYSS.">
  <li data-offset="5">Give pardon to my speech:</li>
  <li>Therefore ’tis meet Achilles meet not Hector.</li>
  <li>Let us like merchants first show foul wares,</li>
  <li>And think perchance they’ll sell; if not,</li>
  <li data-number="360">The lustre of the better shall exceed</li>
  <li>By showing the worse first. Do not consent</li>
  <li>That ever Hector and Achilles meet,</li>
  <li>For both our honor and our shame in this</li>
  <li>Are dogg’d with two strange followers.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NEST.">
  <li data-number="365">I see them not with my old eyes, what are they?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ULYSS.">
  <li>What glory our Achilles shares from Hector,</li>
  <li>Were he not proud, we all should share with him.</li>
  <li>But he already is too insolent;</li>
  <li>And it were better parch in Afric sun</li>
  <li data-number="370">Than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes,</li>
  <li>Should he scape Hector fair. If he were foil’d,</li>
  <li>Why then we do our main opinion crush</li>
  <li>In taint of our best man. No, make a lott’ry,</li>
  <li>And by device let blockish Ajax draw</li>
  <li data-number="375">The sort to fight with Hector; among ourselves</li>
  <li>Give him allowance for the better man,</li>
  <li>For that will physic the great Myrmidon,</li>
  <li>Who broils in loud applause, and make him fall</li>
  <li>His crest that prouder than blue Iris bends.</li>
  <li data-number="380">If the dull brainless Ajax come safe off,</li>
  <li>We’ll dress him up in voices; if he fail,</li>
  <li>Yet go we under our opinion still</li>
  <li>That we have better men. But hit or miss,</li>
  <li>Our project’s life this shape of sense assumes:</li>
  <li data-number="385">Ajax employ’d plucks down Achilles’ plumes.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NEST.">
  <li>Now, Ulysses, I begin to relish thy advice,</li>
  <li>And I will give a taste thereof forthwith</li>
  <li>To Agamemnon. Go we to him straight.</li>
  <li>Two curs shall tame each other; pride alone</li>
  <li data-number="390">Must tarre the mastiffs on, as ’twere a bone.</li>

Would it were otherwise: that I could beat him, whilst he rail’d at me. ’Sfoot, I’ll learn to conjure and raise devils, but I’ll see some issue of my spiteful execrations. Then there’s Achilles, a rare enginer! If Troy be not taken till these two undermine it, the walls will stand till they fall of themselves. 
O thou great thunder-darter of Olympus, forget that thou art Jove, the king of gods, and, Mercury, lose all the serpentine craft of thy caduceus, if ye take not that little little less than little wit from them that they have, which short-arm’d ignorance itself knows is so abundant scarce, it will not in circumvention deliver a fly from a spider, without drawing their massy irons and cutting the web! After this, the vengeance on the whole camp! Or rather, the Neapolitan bone-ache! For that methinks is the curse depending on those that war for a placket.

  <li>One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,</li>

  <li>He must fight singly tomorrow with Hector, and is so prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he raves in saying nothing.</li>

The man’s undone forever, for if Hector break not his neck i’ th’ combat, he’ll break’t himself in vainglory. He knows not me. I said, “Good morrow, Ajax”; and he replies, “Thanks, Agamemnon.” 
What think you of this man that takes me for the general? He’s grown a very land-fish, languageless, a monster. A plague of opinion! A man may wear it on both sides, like a leather jerkin.</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ACHIL.">
  <li>To him, Patroclus. Tell him I humbly desire the valiant Ajax to invite the most valorous Hector to come unarm’d to my tent, and to procure safe-conduct for his person of the magnanimous and most
