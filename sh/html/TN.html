<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li>If music be the food of love, play on,</li>
  <li>Give me excess of it; that surfeiting,</li>
  <li>The appetite may sicken, and so die.</li>
  <li>That strain again, it had a dying fall;</li>
  <li data-number="5">O, it came o’er my ear like the sweet sound</li>
  <li>That breathes upon a bank of violets,</li>
  <li>Stealing and giving odor. Enough, no more,</li>
  <li>’Tis not so sweet now as it was before.</li>
  <li>O spirit of love, how quick and fresh art thou,</li>
  <li data-number="10">That notwithstanding thy capacity</li>
  <li>Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there,</li>
  <li>Of what validity and pitch soe’er,</li>
  <li>But falls into abatement and low price</li>
  <li>Even in a minute. So full of shapes is fancy</li>
  <li>That it alone is high fantastical.</li>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li>Why, so I do, the noblest that I have.</li>
  <li>O, when mine eyes did see Olivia first,</li>
  <li>Methought she purg’d the air of pestilence!</li>
  <li data-number="20">That instant was I turn’d into a hart,</li>
  <li>And my desires, like fell and cruel hounds,</li>
  <li>E’er since pursue me.</li>

  <li>So please my lord, I might not be admitted,</li>
  <li>But from her handmaid do return this answer:</li>
  <li data-number="25">The element itself, till seven years’ heat,</li>
  <li>Shall not behold her face at ample view;</li>
  <li>But like a cloistress she will veiled walk,</li>
  <li>And water once a day her chamber round</li>
  <li>With eye-offending brine; all this to season</li>
  <li data-number="30">A brother’s dead love, which she would keep fresh</li>
  <li>And lasting in her sad remembrance.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li>O, she that hath a heart of that fine frame</li>
  <li>To pay this debt of love but to a brother,</li>
  <li>How will she love when the rich golden shaft</li>
  <li data-number="35">Hath kill’d the flock of all affections else</li>
  <li>That live in her; when liver, brain, and heart,</li>
  <li>These sovereign thrones, are all supplied and fill’d</li>
  <li>Her sweet perfections with one self king!</li>

<h4>The sea coast.</h4>

	Enter Viola, a Captain, and Sailors.

</div>

<ol data-speaker="VIO.">
  <li>What country, friends, is this?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAP.">
  <li>This is Illyria, lady.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VIO.">
  <li>And what should I do in Illyria?</li>
  <li>My brother he is in Elysium.</li>
  <li data-number="5">Perchance he is not drown’d—what think you, sailors?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAP.">
  <li>It is perchance that you yourself were saved.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VIO.">
  <li>O my poor brother! And so perchance may he be.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAP.">
  <li>True, madam, and to comfort you with chance,</li>
  <li>Assure yourself, after our ship did split,</li>
  <li data-number="10">When you, and those poor number saved with you,</li>
  <li>Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,</li>
  <li>Most provident in peril, bind himself</li>
  <li>(Courage and hope both teaching him the practice)</li>
  <li>To a strong mast that liv’d upon the sea;</li>
  <li data-number="15">Where like Arion on the dolphin’s back,</li>
  <li>I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves</li>
  <li>So long as I could see.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VIO.">
  <li>For saying so, there’s gold.</li>
  <li>Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,</li>
  <li data-number="20">Whereto thy speech serves for authority,</li>
  <li>The like of him. Know’st thou this country?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAP.">
  <li>Ay, madam, well, for I was bred and born</li>
  <li>Not three hours’ travel from this very place.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VIO.">
  <li>Who governs here?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAP.">
  <li data-number="25">A noble duke, in nature as in name.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VIO.">
  <li>What is his name?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAP.">
  <li>Orsino.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VIO.">
  <li>Orsino! I have heard my father name him. He was a bachelor then.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAP.">
  <li>And so is now, or was so very late;</li>
  <li data-number="30">For but a month ago I went from hence,</li>
  <li>And then ’twas fresh in murmur (as you know</li>
  <li>What great ones do, the less will prattle of)</li>
  <li>That he did seek the love of fair Olivia.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VIO.">
  <li>What’s she?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAP.">
  <li data-number="35">A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count</li>
  <li>That died some twelvemonth since, then leaving her</li>
  <li>In the protection of his son, her brother,</li>
  <li>Who shortly also died; for whose dear love,</li>
  <li>They say, she hath abjur’d the company</li>
  <li>And sight of men.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VIO.">
  <li data-number="40" data-offset="4">O that I serv’d that lady,</li>
  <li>And might not be delivered to the world</li>
  <li>Till I had made mine own occasion mellow</li>
  <li>What my estate is!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAP.">
  <li data-offset="4">That were hard to compass,</li>
  <li>Because she will admit no kind of suit,</li>
  <li data-number="45">No, not the Duke’s.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VIO.">
  <li>There is a fair behavior in thee, captain,</li>
  <li>And though that nature with a beauteous wall</li>
  <li>Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee</li>
  <li>I will believe thou hast a mind that suits</li>
  <li data-number="50">With this thy fair and outward character.</li>
  <li>I prithee (and I’ll pay thee bounteously)</li>
  <li>Conceal me what I am, and be my aid</li>
  <li>For such disguise as haply shall become</li>
  <li>The form of my intent. I’ll serve this duke;</li>
  <li data-number="55">Thou shalt present me as an eunuch to him,</li>
  <li>It may be worth thy pains; for I can sing</li>
  <li>And speak to him in many sorts of music</li>
  <li>That will allow me very worth his service.</li>
  <li>What else may hap, to time I will commit,</li>
  <li data-number="60">Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAP.">
  <li>Be you his eunuch, and your mute I’ll be;</li>
  <li>When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VIO.">
  <li>I thank thee. Lead me on.</li>

<h3>Scene 3</h3>

<h4>A room in Olivia’s house.</h4>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Sir Toby Belch and Maria.
	
		SIR TO.
		MAR.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TO.">
  <li>What a plague means my niece to take the death of her brother thus? I am sure care’s an enemy to life.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MAR.">
  <li>By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier a’ nights. Your cousin, my lady, takes great exceptions to your ill hours.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TO.">
  <li>Why, let her except before excepted.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MAR.">
  <li>Ay, but you must confine yourself within the modest limits of order.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TO.">
  <li data-number="5">Confine? I’ll confine myself no finer than I am. These clothes are good enough to drink in, and so be these boots too; and they be not, let them hang themselves in their own straps.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MAR.">
  <li>That quaffing and drinking will undo you. I heard my lady talk of it yesterday; and of a foolish knight that you brought in one night here to be her wooer.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TO.">
  <li>Who, Sir Andrew Aguecheek?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MAR.">
  <li>Ay, he.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TO.">
  <li>He’s as tall a man as any’s in Illyria.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MAR.">
  <li data-number="10">What’s that to th’ purpose?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TO.">
  <li>Why, he has three thousand ducats a year.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MAR.">
  <li>Ay, but he’ll have but a year in all these ducats. He’s a very fool and a prodigal.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TO.">
  <li>Fie, that you’ll say so! He plays o’ th’ viol-de-gamboys, and speaks three or four languages word for word without book, and hath all the good gifts of nature.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MAR.">
  <li>He hath indeed, almost natural; for besides that he’s a fool, he’s a great quarreler; and but that he hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust he hath in quarreling, ’tis thought among the prudent he would quickly have the gift of a grave.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TO.">
  <li data-number="15">By this hand, they are scoundrels and sub-stractors that say so of him. Who are they?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MAR.">
  <li>They that add moreov’r, he’s drunk nightly in your company.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TO.">
  <li>With drinking healths to my niece. I’ll drink to her as long as there is a passage in my throat, and drink in Illyria. He’s a coward and a coystrill that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn o’ th’ toe like a parish-top. What, wench! <foreign xml:lang="es">Castiliano vulgo!</foreign> For here comes Sir Andrew Agueface.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Sir Andrew Aguecheek.
	
		SIR AND.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="SIR AND.">
  <li>Sir Toby Belch! How now, Sir Toby Belch?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TO.">
  <li>Sweet Sir Andrew!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR AND.">
  <li data-number="20">Bless you, fair shrew.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MAR.">
  <li>And you too, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TO.">
  <li>Accost, Sir Andrew, accost.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR AND.">
  <li>What’s that?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TO.">
  <li>My niece’s chambermaid.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR AND.">
  <li data-number="25">Good Mistress Accost, I desire better acquaintance.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MAR.">
  <li>My name is Mary, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR AND.">
  <li>Good Mistress Mary Accost—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TO.">
  <li>You mistake, knight. “Accost” is front her, board her, woo her, assail her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR AND.">
  <li>By my troth, I would not undertake her in this company. Is that the meaning of “accost”?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MAR.">
  <li data-number="30">Fare you well, gentlemen.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TO.">
  <li>And thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would thou mightst never draw sword again.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR AND.">
  <li>And you part so, mistress, I would I might never draw sword again. Fair lady, do you think you have fools in hand?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MAR.">
  <li>Sir, I have not you by th’ hand.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR AND.">
  <li>Marry, but you shall have—and here’s my hand.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MAR.">
  <li data-number="35">Now, sir, thought is free. I pray you bring your hand to th’ butt’ry-bar, and let it drink.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR AND.">
  <li>Wherefore, sweetheart? What’s your metaphor?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MAR.">
  <li>It’s dry, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR AND.">
  <li>Why, I think so. I am not such an ass but I can keep my hand dry. But what’s your jest?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MAR.">
  <li>A dry jest, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR AND.">
  <li data-number="40">Are you full of them?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MAR.">
  <li>Ay, sir, I have them at my fingers’ ends. Marry, now I let go your hand, I am barren.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Exit Maria.
	
		MAR.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TO.">
  <li>O knight, thou lack’st a cup of canary. When did I see thee so put down?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR AND.">
  <li>Never in your life I think, unless you see canary put me down. Methinks sometimes I have no more wit than a Christian or an ordinary man has; but I am a great eater of beef, and I believe that does harm to my wit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TO.">
  <li>No question.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR AND.">
  <li data-number="45">And I thought that, I’d forswear it. I’ll ride home tomorrow, Sir Toby.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TO.">
  <li><foreign xml:lang="fr">Pourquoi</foreign>, my dear knight?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR AND.">
  <li>What is <foreign xml:lang="fr">“pourquoi”</foreign>? Do, or not do? I would I had bestow’d that time in the tongues that I have in fencing, dancing, and bear-baiting. O had I but follow’d the arts!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TO.">
  <li>Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR AND.">
  <li>Why, would that have mended my hair?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TO.">
  <li data-number="50">Past question, for thou seest it will not curl by nature.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR AND.">
  <li>But it becomes me well enough, does’t not?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TO.">
  <li>Excellent, it hangs like flax on a distaff; and I hope to see a huswife take thee between her legs, and spin it off.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR AND.">
  <li>Faith, I’ll home tomorrow, Sir Toby. Your niece will not be seen, or if she be, it’s four to one she’ll none of me. The Count himself here hard by woos her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TO.">
  <li>She’ll none o’ th’ Count. She’ll not match above her degree, neither in estate, years, nor wit; I have heard her swear’t. Tut, there’s life in’t, man.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR AND.">
  <li data-number="55">I’ll stay a month longer. I am a fellow o’ th’ strangest mind i’ th’ world; I delight in masques and revels sometimes altogether.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TO.">
  <li>Art thou good at these kickshawses, knight?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR AND.">
  <li>As any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be, under the degree of my betters, and yet I will not compare with an old man.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TO.">
  <li>What is thy excellence in a galliard, knight?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR AND.">
  <li>Faith, I can cut a caper.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TO.">
  <li data-number="60">And I can cut the mutton to’t.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR AND.">
  <li>And I think I have the back-trick simply as strong as any man in Illyria.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TO.">
  <li>Wherefore are these things hid? Wherefore have these gifts a curtain before ’em? Are they like to take dust, like Mistress Mall’s picture? Why dost thou not go to church in a galliard, and come home in a coranto? My very walk should be a jig.</li>
  <li>I would not so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace. What dost thou mean? Is it a world to hide virtues in? I did think by the excellent constitution of thy leg, it was form’d under the star of a galliard.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR AND.">
  <li>Ay, ’tis strong; and it does indifferent well in a dun-color’d stock. Shall we set about some revels?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TO.">
  <li data-number="65">What shall we do else? Were we not born under Taurus?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR AND.">
  <li>Taurus? That’s sides and heart.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TO.">
  <li>No, sir, it is legs and thighs. Let me see thee caper. Ha, higher! Ha, ha, excellent!</li>

  <li>Wit, and’t be thy will, put me into good fooling! Those wits that think they have thee do very oft prove fools; and I that am sure I lack thee, may pass for a wise man. For what says Quinapalus? “Better a witty fool than a foolish wit.”—God bless thee, lady!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OLI.">
  <li>Take the fool away.</li>

<ol data-speaker="CLO.">
  <li>Do you not hear, fellows? Take away the lady.</li>

  <li>Go to, y’ are a dry fool; I’ll no more of you. Besides, you grow dishonest.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLO.">
  <li data-number="20">Two faults, madonna, that drink and good counsel will amend; for give the dry fool drink, then is the fool not dry; bid the dishonest man mend himself: if he mend, he is no longer dishonest; if he cannot, let the botcher mend him. Any thing that’s mended is but patch’d; virtue that transgresses is but patch’d with sin, and sin that amends is but patch’d with virtue. If that this simple syllogism will serve, so; if it will not, what remedy? As there is no true cuckold but calamity, so beauty’s a flower. The lady bade take away the fool, therefore I say again, take her away.</li>

  <li>I marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a barren rascal. I saw him put down the other day with an ordinary fool that has no more brain than a stone. Look you now, he’s out of his guard already. Unless you laugh and minister occasion to him, he is gagg’d.

  <li>O, you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and taste with a distemper’d appetite.

  <li>You tell her so. Must she not then be answer’d?</li>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li data-number="85">There is no woman’s sides</li>

  <li>So big, to hold so much; they lack retention.</li>
  <li>Alas, their love may be call’d appetite,</li>
  <li data-number="90">No motion of the liver, but the palate,</li>
  <li>That suffer surfeit, cloyment, and revolt,</li>
  <li>But mine is all as hungry as the sea,</li>

  <li data-number="105">And with a green and yellow melancholy</li>
  <li>She sate like Patience on a monument,</li>
  <li>Smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed?</li>
  <li>We men may say more, swear more, but indeed</li>
  <li>Our shows are more than will; for still we prove</li>

  <li>Under your hard construction must I sit,</li>

  <li>Cesario, by the roses of the spring,</li>
  <li>By maidhood, honor, truth, and every thing,</li>
  <li data-number="110">I love thee so, that maugre all thy pride,</li>
  <li>Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide.</li>
  <li>Do not extort thy reasons from this clause,</li>

  <li>But rather reason thus with reason fetter:</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VIO.">
  <li>By innocence I swear, and by my youth,</li>
  <li>I have one heart, one bosom, and one truth,</li>

  <li>Shall mistress be of it, save I alone.</li>
  <li data-number="120">And so <foreign xml:lang="fr">adieu</foreign>, good madam, never more</li>

<ol data-speaker="SIR AND.">
  <li>No, faith, I’ll not stay a jot longer.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TO.">
  <li>Thy reason, dear venom, give thy reason.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAB.">
  <li>You must needs yield your reason, Sir Andrew.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR AND.">
  <li>Marry, I saw your niece do more favors to the Count’s servingman than ever she bestow’d upon me. I saw’t i’ th’ orchard.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TO.">
  <li data-number="5">Did she see thee the while, old boy? Tell me that.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR AND.">
  <li>As plain as I see you now.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAB.">
  <li>This was a great argument of love in her toward you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR AND.">
  <li>’Slight! Will you make an ass o’ me?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAB.">
  <li>I will prove it legitimate, sir, upon the oaths of judgment and reason.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TO.">
  <li data-number="10">And they have been grand-jurymen since before Noah was a sailor.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAB.">
  <li>She did show favor to the youth in your sight only to exasperate you, to awake your dormouse valor, to put fire in your heart, and brimstone in your liver. You should then have accosted her, and with some excellent jests, fire-new from the mint, you should have bang’d the youth into dumbness. This was look’d for at your hand, and this was balk’d. The double gilt of this opportunity you let time wash off, and you are now sail’d into the north of my lady’s opinion, where you will hang like an icicle on a Dutchman’s beard, unless you do redeem it by some laudable attempt either of valor or policy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR AND.">
  <li>And’t be any way, it must be with valor, for policy I hate. I had as lief be a Brownist as a politician.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TO.">
  <li>Why then build me thy fortunes upon the basis of valor. Challenge me the Count’s youth to fight with him, hurt him in eleven places—my niece shall take note of it, and assure thyself, there is no love-broker in the world can more prevail in man’s commendation with woman than report of valor.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAB.">
  <li>There is no way but this, Sir Andrew.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR AND.">
  <li data-number="15">Will either of you bear me a challenge to him?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TO.">
  <li>Go, write it in a martial hand, be curst and brief. It is no matter how witty, so it be eloquent and full of invention. Taunt him with the license of ink. If thou thou’st him some thrice, it shall not be amiss; and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of paper, although the sheet were big enough for the bed of Ware in England, set ’em down. Go about it. Let there be gall enough in thy ink, though thou write with a goose-pen, no matter. About it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR AND.">
  <li>Where shall I find you?</li>

  <li>We shall have a rare letter from him; but you’ll not deliver’t?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TO.">
  <li>Never trust me then; and by all means stir on the youth to an answer. I think oxen and wain-ropes cannot hale them together. For Andrew, if he were open’d and you find so much blood in his liver as will clog the foot of a flea, I’ll eat the rest of th’ anatomy.</li>

Yond gull Malvolio is turn’d heathen, a very renegado; for there is no Christian that means to be sav’d by believing rightly can ever believe such impossible passages of grossness. He’s in yellow stockings.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TO.">
  <li>And cross-garter’d?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MAR.">
  <li>Most villainously; like a pedant that keeps a school i’ th’ church. I have dogg’d him like his murderer. He does obey every point of the letter that I dropp’d to betray him. He does smile his face into more lines than is in the new map, with the augmentation of the Indies; you have not seen such a thing as ’tis. I can hardly forbear hurling things at him. I know my lady will strike him. If she do, he’ll smile, and take’t for a great favor.</li>

I have lim’d her, but it is Jove’s doing, and Jove make me thankful! And when she went away now, “Let this fellow be look’d to”; “fellow”! Not “Malvolio,” nor after my degree, but “fellow.” Why, every thing adheres together, that no dram of a scruple, no scruple of a scruple, no obstacle, no incredulous or unsafe circumstance—What can be said?
