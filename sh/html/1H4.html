<ol data-speaker="KING.">
  <li>So shaken as we are, so wan with care,</li>
  <li>Find we a time for frighted peace to pant</li>
  <li>And breathe short-winded accents of new broils</li>
  <li>To be commenc’d in stronds afar remote.</li>
  <li data-number="5">No more the thirsty entrance of this soil</li>
  <li>Shall daub her lips with her own children’s blood,</li>
  <li>No more shall trenching war channel her fields,</li>
  <li>Nor bruise her flow’rets with the armed hoofs</li>
  <li>Of hostile paces. Those opposed eyes,</li>
  <li data-number="10">Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,</li>
  <li>All of one nature, of one substance bred,</li>
  <li>Did lately meet in the intestine shock</li>
  <li>And furious close of civil butchery,</li>
  <li>Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,</li>
  <li data-number="15">March all one way and be no more oppos’d</li>
  <li>Against acquaintance, kindred, and allies.</li>
  <li>The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,</li>
  <li>No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,</li>
  <li>As far as to the sepulchre of Christ—</li>
  <li data-number="20">Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross</li>
  <li>We are impressed and engag’d to fight—</li>
  <li>Forthwith a power of English shall we levy,</li>
  <li>Whose arms were moulded in their mother’s womb,</li>
  <li>To chase these pagans in those holy fields,</li>
  <li data-number="25">Over whose acres walk’d those blessed feet</li>
  <li>Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail’d</li>
  <li>For our advantage on the bitter cross.</li>
  <li>But this our purpose now is twelve month old,</li>
  <li>And bootless ’tis to tell you we will go;</li>
  <li data-number="30">Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear</li>
  <li>Of you, my gentle cousin Westmorland,</li>
  <li>What yesternight our Council did decree</li>
  <li>In forwarding this dear expedience.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WEST.">
  <li>My liege, this haste was hot in question.</li>
  <li data-number="35">And many limits of the charge set down</li>
  <li>But yesternight, when all athwart there came</li>
  <li>A post from Wales loaden with heavy news,</li>
  <li>Whose worst was that the noble Mortimer,</li>
  <li>Leading the men of Herfordshire to fight</li>
  <li data-number="40">Against the irregular and wild Glendower,</li>
  <li>Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,</li>
  <li>A thousand of his people butchered,</li>
  <li>Upon whose dead corpse’ there was such misuse,</li>
  <li>Such beastly shameless transformation,</li>
  <li data-number="45">By those Welshwomen done as may not be</li>
  <li>Without much shame retold or spoken of.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING.">
  <li>It seems then that the tidings of this broil</li>
  <li>Brake off our business for the Holy Land.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WEST.">
  <li>This match’d with other did, my gracious lord,</li>
  <li data-number="50">For more uneven and unwelcome news</li>
  <li>Came from the north, and thus it did import:</li>
  <li>On <date when=" — 09-14" type="holiday" subtype="Christian">Holy-rood day</date>, the gallant Hotspur there,</li>
  <li>Young Harry Percy, and brave Archibald,</li>
  <li>That ever-valiant and approved Scot,</li>
  <li data-number="55">At Holmedon met,</li>
  <li>Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour,</li>
  <li>As by discharge of their artillery</li>
  <li>And shape of likelihood the news was told;</li>
  <li>For he that brought them, in the very heat</li>
  <li data-number="60">And pride of their contention did take horse,</li>
  <li>Uncertain of the issue any way.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING.">
  <li>Here is a dear, a true industrious friend,</li>
  <li>Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse,</li>
  <li>Stain’d with the variation of each soil</li>
  <li data-number="65">Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours;</li>
  <li>And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.</li>
  <li>The Earl of Douglas is discomfited:</li>
  <li>Ten thousand bold Scots, two and twenty knights,</li>
  <li>Balk’d in their own blood, did Sir Walter see</li>
  <li data-number="70">On Holmedon’s plains. Of prisoners, Hotspur took</li>
  <li>Mordake Earl of Fife and eldest son</li>
  <li>To beaten Douglas, and the Earl of Athol,</li>
  <li>Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith.</li>
  <li>And is not this an honorable spoil?</li>
  <li data-number="75">A gallant prize? Ha, cousin, is it not?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WEST.">
  <li>In faith,</li>
  <li>It is a conquest for a prince to boast of.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING.">
  <li>Yea, there thou mak’st me sad, and mak’st me sin</li>
  <li>In envy that my Lord Northumberland</li>
  <li data-number="80">Should be the father to so blest a son—</li>
  <li> A son who is the theme of honor’s tongue,</li>
  <li>Amongst a grove the very straightest plant,</li>
  <li>Who is sweet Fortune’s minion and her pride,</li>
  <li>Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him,</li>
  <li data-number="85">See riot and dishonor stain the brow</li>
  <li>Of my young Harry. O that it could be prov’d</li>
  <li>That some night-tripping fairy had exchang’d</li>
  <li>In cradle-clothes our children where they lay,</li>
  <li>And call’d mine Percy, his Plantagenet!</li>
  <li data-number="90">Then would I have his Harry and he mine.</li>
  <li>But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,</li>
  <li>Of this young Percy’s pride? The prisoners</li>
  <li>Which he in this adventure hath surpris’d</li>
  <li>To his own use he keeps, and sends me word</li>
  <li data-number="95">I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WEST.">
  <li>This is his uncle’s teaching; this is Worcester,</li>
  <li>Malevolent to you in all aspects,</li>
  <li>Which makes him prune himself, and bristle up</li>
  <li>The crest of youth against your dignity.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING.">
  <li data-number="100">But I have sent for him to answer this;</li>
  <li>And for this cause a while we must neglect</li>
  <li>Our holy purpose to Jerusalem.</li>
  <li>Cousin, on Wednesday next our Council we</li>
  <li>Will hold at Windsor, so inform the lords.</li>
  <li data-number="105">But come yourself with speed to us again,</li>
  <li>For more is to be said and to be done</li>
  <li>Than out of anger can be uttered.</li>
</ol>

  <li>I will, my liege.</li>

<h3>Scene 2</h3>

<h4>London. An apartment of the Prince’s.</h4>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Prince of Wales and Sir John Falstaff.
	
		PRINCE.
		FAL.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li>Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li>Thou art so fat-witted with drinking of old sack, and unbuttoning thee after supper, and sleeping upon benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to demand that truly which thou wouldest truly know. What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the day? Unless hours were cups of sack, and minutes capons, and clocks the tongues of bawds, and dials the signs of leaping-houses, and the blessed sun himself a fair hot wench in flame-color’d taffeta; I see no reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand the time of the day.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li>Indeed you come near me now, Hal, for we that take purses go by the moon and the seven stars, and not by Phoebus, he, “that wand’ring knight so fair.” And I prithee, sweet wag, when thou art a king, as, God save thy Grace—Majesty I should say, for grace thou wilt have none—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li>What, none?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li data-number="5">No, by my troth, not so much as will serve to be prologue to an egg and butter.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li>Well, how then? Come, roundly, roundly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li>Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not us that are squires of the night’s body be call’d thieves of the day’s beauty. Let us be Diana’s foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the moon, and let men say we be men of good government, being govern’d, as the sea is, by our noble and chaste mistress the moon, under whose countenance we steal.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li>Thou sayest well, and it holds well too, for the fortune of us that are the moon’s men doth ebb and flow like the sea, being govern’d, as the sea is, by the moon. As, for proof, now: a purse of gold most resolutely snatch’d on Monday night and most dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning; got with swearing “Lay by,” and spent with crying “Bring in”; now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder, and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li>By the Lord, thou say’st true, lad. And is not my hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li data-number="10">As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle. And is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li>How now, how now, mad wag? What, in thy quips and thy quiddities? What a plague have I to do with a buff jerkin?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li>Why, what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li>Well, thou hast call’d her to a reckoning many a time and oft.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li>Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li data-number="15">No, I’ll give thee thy due, thou hast paid all there.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li>Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch, and where it would not, I have us’d my credit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li>Yea, and so us’d it that, were it not here apparent that thou art heir apparent—But I prithee, sweet wag, shall there be gallows standing in England when thou art king? And resolution thus fubb’d as it is with the rusty curb of old father antic the law? Do not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li>No, thou shalt.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li>Shall I? O rare! By the Lord, I’ll be a brave judge.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li data-number="20">Thou judgest false already. I mean thou shalt have the hanging of the thieves, and so become a rare hangman.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li>Well, Hal, well, and in some sort it jumps with my humor as well as waiting in the court, I can tell you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li>For obtaining of suits?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li>Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman hath no lean wardrobe. ’Sblood, I am as melancholy as a gib cat or a lugg’d bear.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li>Or an old lion, or a lover’s lute.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li data-number="25">Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li>What sayest thou to a hare, or the melancholy of Moor-ditch?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li>Thou hast the most unsavory similes and art indeed the most comparative, rascalliest, sweet young prince. But, Hal, I prithee trouble me no more with vanity; I would to God thou and I knew where a commodity of good names were to be bought. An old lord of the Council rated me the other day in the street about you, sir, but I mark’d him not, and yet he talk’d very wisely, but I regarded him not, and yet he talk’d wisely, and in the street too.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li>Thou didst well, for wisdom cries out in the streets, and no man regards it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li>O, thou hast damnable iteration, and art indeed able to corrupt a saint. Thou hast done much harm upon me, Hal, God forgive thee for it! Before I knew thee, Hal, I knew nothing, and now am I, if a man should speak truly, little better than one of the wicked. I must give over this life, and I will give it over. By the Lord, and I do not, I am a villain, I’ll be damn’d for never a king’s son in Christendom.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li data-number="30">Where shall we take a purse tomorrow, Jack?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li>’Zounds, where thou wilt, lad, I’ll make one, an’ I do not, call me villain and baffle me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li>I see a good amendment of life in thee, from praying to purse-taking.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li>Why, Hal, ’tis my vocation, Hal, ’tis no sin for a man to labor in his vocation.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">
	Enter Poins.
	
		POINS.
	
</li>
  <li>Poins! Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a match. O, if men were to be sav’d by merit, what hole in hell were hot enough for him? This is the most omnipotent villain that ever cried “Stand!” to a true man.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li data-number="35">Good morrow, Ned.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POINS.">
  <li>Good morrow, sweet Hal. What says <foreign xml:lang="fr">Monsieur</foreign> Remorse? What says Sir John Sack and Sugar? Jack, how agrees the devil and thee about thy soul that thou soldest him on Good Friday last, for a cup of Madeira and a cold capon’s leg?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li>Sir John stands to his word, the devil shall have his bargain, for he was never yet a breaker of proverbs. He will give the devil his due.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POINS.">
  <li>Then art thou damn’d for keeping thy word with the devil.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li>Else he had been damn’d for cozening the devil.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POINS.">
  <li data-number="40">But, my lads, my lads, tomorrow morning by four a’ clock early, at Gadshill, there are pilgrims going to Canterbury with rich offerings, and traders riding to London with fat purses. I have vizards for you all; you have horses for yourselves. Gadshill lies tonight in Rochester. I have bespoke supper tomorrow night in Eastcheap. We may do it as secure as sleep. If you will go, I will stuff your purses full of crowns; if you will not, tarry at home and be hang’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li>Hear ye, Yedward, if I tarry at home and go not, I’ll hang you for going.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POINS.">
  <li>You will, chops?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li>Hal, wilt thou make one?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li>Who, I rob? I a thief? Not I, by my faith.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li data-number="45">There’s neither honesty, manhood, nor good fellowship in thee, nor thou cam’st not of the blood royal, if thou darest not stand for ten shillings.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li>Well then, once in my days I’ll be a madcap.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li>Why, that’s well said.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li>Well, come what will, I’ll tarry at home.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li>By the Lord, I’ll be a traitor then, when thou art king.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li data-number="50">I care not.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POINS.">
  <li>Sir John, I prithee leave the Prince and me alone, I will lay him down such reasons for this adventure that he shall go.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li>Well, God give thee the spirit of persuasion and him the ears of profiting, that what thou speakest may move and what he hears may be believ’d, that the true prince may (for recreation sake) prove a false thief, for the poor abuses of the time want countenance. Farewell, you shall find me in Eastcheap.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li>Farewell, the latter spring! Farewell, All-hallown summer!</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Exit Falstaff.
	
		FAL.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="POINS.">
  <li>Now, my good sweet honey lord, ride with us tomorrow. I have a jest to execute that I cannot manage alone. Falstaff, Bardolph, Peto, and Gadshill shall rob those men that we have already waylaid; yourself and I will not be there; and when they have the booty, if you and I do not rob them, cut this head off from my shoulders.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li data-number="55">How shall we part with them in setting forth?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POINS.">
  <li>Why, we will set forth before or after them and appoint them a place of meeting, wherein it is at our pleasure to fail; and then will they adventure upon the exploit themselves, which they shall have no sooner achiev’d but we’ll set upon them.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li>Yea, but ’tis like that they will know us by our horses, by our habits, and by every other appointment to be ourselves.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POINS.">
  <li>Tut, our horses they shall not see—I’ll tie them in the wood; our vizards we will change after we leave them; and, sirrah, I have cases of buckram for the nonce, to immask our noted outward garments.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li>Yea, but I doubt they will be too hard for us.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POINS.">
  <li data-number="60">Well, for two of them, I know them to be as true-bred cowards as ever turn’d back; and for the third, if he fight longer than he sees reason, I’ll forswear arms. The virtue of this jest will be the incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will tell us when we meet at supper, how thirty at least he fought with, what wards, what blows, what extremities he endur’d, and in the reproof of this lives the jest.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li>Well, I’ll go with thee. Provide us all things necessary, and meet me tomorrow night in Eastcheap, there I’ll sup. Farewell.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POINS.">
  <li>Farewell, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Exit Poins.
	
		POINS.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li>I know you all, and will a while uphold</li>
  <li>The unyok’d humor of your idleness,</li>
  <li data-number="65">Yet herein will I imitate the sun,</li>
  <li>Who doth permit the base contagious clouds</li>
  <li>To smother up his beauty from the world,</li>
  <li>That when he please again to be himself,</li>
  <li>Being wanted, he may be more wond’red at</li>
  <li data-number="70">By breaking through the foul and ugly mists</li>
  <li>Of vapors that did seem to strangle him.</li>
  <li>If all the year were playing holidays,</li>
  <li>To sport would be as tedious as to work;</li>
  <li>But when they seldom come, they wish’d for come,</li>
  <li data-number="75">And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents.</li>
  <li>So when this loose behavior I throw off</li>
  <li>And pay the debt I never promised,</li>
  <li>By how much better than my word I am,</li>
  <li>By so much shall I falsify men’s hopes,</li>
  <li data-number="80">And like bright metal on a sullen ground,</li>
  <li>My reformation, glitt’ring o’er my fault,</li>
  <li>Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes</li>
  <li>Than that which hath no foil to set it off.</li>
  <li>I’ll so offend, to make offense a skill,</li>
  <li data-number="85">Redeeming time when men think least I will.</li>

</li>
  <li>You were about to speak.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NORTH.">
  <li data-offset="5">Yea, my good lord.</li>
  <li>Those prisoners in your Highness’ name demanded,</li>
  <li>Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took,</li>
  <li data-number="25">Were, as he says, not with such strength denied</li>
  <li>As is delivered to your Majesty.</li>
  <li>Either envy, therefore, or misprision</li>

<ol data-speaker="HOT.">
  <li>My liege, I did deny no prisoners,</li>
  <li data-number="30">But I remember, when the fight was done,</li>
  <li>When I was dry with rage and extreme toil,</li>
  <li>Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,</li>
  <li>Came there a certain lord, neat, and trimly dress’d,</li>
  <li>Fresh as a bridegroom, and his chin new reap’d</li>
  <li data-number="35">Show’d like a stubble-land at harvest-home.</li>
  <li>He was perfumed like a milliner,</li>
  <li>And ’twixt his finger and his thumb he held</li>
  <li>A pouncet-box, which ever and anon</li>
  <li>He gave his nose and took’t away again,</li>
  <li data-number="40">Who therewith angry, when it next came there,</li>
  <li>Took it in snuff—and still he smil’d and talk’d:</li>
  <li>And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,</li>
  <li>He call’d them untaught knaves, unmannerly,</li>
  <li>To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse</li>
  <li data-number="45">Betwixt the wind and his nobility.</li>
  <li>With many holiday and lady terms</li>
  <li>He questioned me, amongst the rest demanded</li>
  <li>My prisoners in your Majesty’s behalf.</li>
  <li>I then, all smarting with my wounds being cold,</li>
  <li data-number="50">To be so pest’red with a popingay,</li>
  <li>Out of my grief and my impatience</li>
  <li>Answer’d neglectingly, I know not what—</li>
  <li>He should, or he should not—for he made me mad</li>
  <li>To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet,</li>

  <li>Of guns, and drums, and wounds, God save the mark!</li>
  <li>And telling me the sovereignest thing on earth</li>
  <li>Was parmaciti for an inward bruise,</li>
  <li>And that it was great pity, so it was,</li>
  <li data-number="60">This villainous saltpeter should be digg’d</li>

  <li>He would himself have been a soldier.</li>
  <li data-number="65">This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord,</li>
  <li>I answered indirectly, as I said,</li>

<ol data-speaker="BLUNT.">
  <li data-number="70">The circumstance considered, good my lord,</li>

  <li>At such a time, with all the rest retold,</li>
  <li>May reasonably die, and never rise</li>

  <li>Why, yet he doth deny his prisoners,</li>
  <li>But with proviso and exception,</li>
  <li>That we at our own charge shall ransom straight</li>
  <li data-number="80">His brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer,</li>
  <li>Who, on my soul, hath willfully betray’d</li>
  <li>The lives of those that he did lead to fight</li>
  <li>Against that great magician, damn’d Glendower,</li>
  <li>Whose daughter, as we hear, that Earl of March</li>
  <li data-number="85">Hath lately married. Shall our coffers then</li>
  <li>Be emptied to redeem a traitor home?</li>
  <li>Shall we buy treason? And indent with fears,</li>

  <li>Revolted Mortimer!</li>
  <li>He never did fall off, my sovereign liege,</li>
  <li data-number="95">But by the chance of war; to prove that true</li>
  <li>Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds,</li>
  <li>Those mouthed wounds, which valiantly he took,</li>
  <li>When on the gentle Severn’s sedgy bank,</li>
  <li>In single opposition hand to hand,</li>
  <li data-number="100">He did confound the best part of an hour</li>
  <li>In changing hardiment with great Glendower.</li>
  <li>Three times they breath’d and three times did they drink,</li>
  <li>Upon agreement, of swift Severn’s flood,</li>
  <li>Who then affrighted with their bloody looks,</li>
  <li data-number="105">Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds,</li>
  <li>And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank,</li>
  <li>Blood-stained with these valiant combatants.</li>
  <li>Never did base and rotten policy</li>
  <li>Color her working with such deadly wounds,</li>
  <li data-number="110">Nor never could the noble Mortimer</li>
  <li>Receive so many, and all willingly.</li>
  <li>Then let not him be slandered with revolt.</li>

<ol data-speaker="KING.">
  <li>Thou dost belie him, Percy, thou dost belie him;</li>

  <li>Good morrow, Master Gadshill. It holds current that I told you yesternight: there’s a franklin in the Wild of Kent hath brought three hundred marks with him in gold.

I am join’d with no foot land-rakers, no long-staff sixpenny strikers, none of these mad mustachio purple-hu’d malt-worms, but with nobility and tranquility, burgomasters and great oney’rs, such as can hold in, such as will strike sooner than speak, and speak sooner than drink, and drink sooner than pray; and yet, ’zounds, I lie, for they pray continually to their saint, the commonwealth, or rather, not pray to her, but prey on her, for they ride up and down on her, and make her their boots.</li>

  <li>Come, shelter, shelter! I have remov’d Falstaff’s horse, and he frets like a gumm’d velvet.</li>

		PRINCE.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li>I am accurs’d to rob in that thieve’s company. The rascal hath remov’d my horse, and tied him I know not where. If I travel but four foot by the squier further afoot, I shall break my wind. Well, I doubt not but to die a fair death for all this, if I scape hanging for killing that rogue. I have forsworn his company hourly any time this two and twenty years, and yet I am bewitch’d with the rogue’s company. If the rascal have not given me medicines to make me love him, I’ll be hang’d. It could not be else, I have drunk medicines. Poins! Hal! A plague upon you both! Bardolph! Peto! I’ll starve ere I’ll rob a foot further. And ’twere not as good a deed as drink to turn true man and to leave these rogues, I am the veriest varlet that ever chew’d with a tooth. Eight yards of uneven ground is threescore and ten miles afoot with me, and the stony-hearted villains know it well enough. A plague upon it when thieves cannot be true one to another!</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li data-number="10">Have you any levers to lift me up again, being down? ’Sblood, I’ll not bear my own flesh so far afoot again for all the coin in thy father’s exchequer. What a plague mean ye to colt me thus?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li>Thou liest, thou art not colted, thou art uncolted.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li>I prithee, good prince—Hal!—help me to my horse, good king’s son.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li>Out, ye rogue! Shall I be your ostler?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li>Hang thyself in thine own heir-apparent garters! If I be ta’en, I’ll peach for this. And I have not ballads made on you all and sung to filthy tunes, let a cup of sack be my poison. When a jest is so forward, and afoot too! I hate it.</li>

  <li><recite>“But, for mine own part, my lord, I could be well contented to be there, in respect of the love I bear your house.”</recite></li>
  <li>He could be contented: why is he not then? In the respect of the love he bears our house: he shows in this, he loves his own barn better than he loves our house. Let me see some more.</li>
  <li><recite>“The purpose you undertake is dangerous”</recite></li>
  <li>—why, that’s certain. ’Tis dangerous to take a cold, to sleep, to drink, but I tell you, my lord fool, out of this nettle, danger, we pluck this flower, safety.</li>
  <li data-number="5"><recite>“The purpose you undertake is dangerous, the friends you have nam’d uncertain, the time itself unsorted, and your whole plot too light for the counterpoise of so great an opposition.”</recite></li>
  <li>Say you so, say you so? I say unto you again, you are a shallow, cowardly hind, and you lie. What a lack-brain is this! By the Lord, our plot is a good plot as ever was laid, our friends true and constant: a good plot, good friends, and full of expectation; an excellent plot, very good friends. What a frosty-spirited rogue is this! Why, my Lord of York commends the plot and the general course of the action. ’Zounds, and I were now by this rascal, I could brain him with his lady’s fan. Is there not my father, my uncle, and myself? Lord Edmund Mortimer, my Lord of York, and Owen Glendower? Is there not besides the Douglas? Have I not all their letters to meet me in arms by the ninth of the next month? And are they not some of them set forward already? What a pagan rascal is this! An infidel! Ha, you shall see now in very sincerity of fear and cold heart will he to the King, and lay open all our proceedings. O, I could divide myself and go to buffets, for moving such a dish of skim-milk with so honorable an action! Hang him! Let him tell the King: we are prepar’d. I will set forward tonight.</li>

</div>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li>Ned, prithee come out of that fat room, and lend me thy hand to laugh a little.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POINS.">
  <li>Where hast been, Hal?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li>With three or four loggerheads amongst three or four score hogsheads. I have sounded the very base-string of humility. Sirrah, I am sworn brother to a leash of drawers, and can call them all by their christen names, as Tom, Dick, and Francis. They take it already upon their salvation, that though I be but Prince of Wales, yet I am the king of courtesy, and tell me flatly I am no proud Jack like Falstaff, but a Corinthian, a lad of mettle, a good boy (by the Lord, so they call me!), and when I am King of England I shall command all the good lads in Eastcheap. They call drinking deep, dyeing scarlet, and when you breathe in your watering, they cry “hem!” and bid you play it off. To conclude, I am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour, that I can drink with any tinker in his own language during my life. I tell thee, Ned, thou hast lost much honor that thou wert not with me in this action. But, sweet Ned—to sweeten which name of Ned, I give thee this pennyworth of sugar, clapp’d even now into my hand by an under-skinker, one that never spake other English in his life than “Eight shillings and sixpence,” and “You are welcome,” with this shrill addition, “Anon, anon, sir! Score a pint of bastard in the Half-moon,” or so. But, Ned, to drive away the time till Falstaff come, I prithee do thou stand in some by-room, while I question my puny drawer to what end he gave me the sugar, and do thou never leave calling “Francis,” that his tale to me may be nothing but “Anon.” Step aside, and I’ll show thee a president.</li>

Harry, I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy time, but also how thou art accompanied; for though the camomile, the more it is trodden on, the faster it grows, yet youth, the more it is wasted, the sooner it wears. That thou art my son I have partly thy mother’s word, partly my own opinion, but chiefly a villainous trick of thine eye, and a foolish hanging of thy nether lip, that doth warrant me. If then thou be son to me, here lies the point: why being son to me, art thou so pointed at? Shall the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat blackberries? A question not to be ask’d. Shall the son of England prove a thief and take purses? A question to be ask’d. There is a thing, Harry, which thou hast often heard of, and it is known to many in our land by the name of pitch. This pitch (as ancient writers do report) doth defile, so doth the company thou keepest; for, Harry, now I do not speak to thee in drink, but in tears; not in pleasure, but in passion; not in words only, but in woes also. And yet there is a virtuous man whom I have often noted in thy company, but I know not his name.</li>

If that man should be lewdly given, he deceiveth me; for, Harry, I see virtue in his looks. If then the tree may be known by the fruit, as the fruit by the tree, then peremptorily I speak it, there is virtue in that Falstaff; him keep with, the rest banish. And tell me now, thou naughty varlet, tell me, where hast thou been this month?</li>

Wherein is he good, but to taste sack and drink it? Wherein neat and cleanly, but to carve a capon and eat it? Wherein cunning, but in craft? Wherein crafty, but in villainy? Wherein villainous, but in all things? Wherein worthy, but in nothing?</li>

  <li>But to say I know more harm in him than in myself, were to say more than I know.

If to be old and merry be a sin, then many an old host that I know is damn’d. If to be fat be to be hated, then Pharaoh’s lean kine are to be lov’d. No, my good lord, banish Peto, banish Bardolph, banish Poins, but for sweet Jack Falstaff, kind Jack Falstaff, true Jack Falstaff, valiant Jack Falstaff, and therefore more valiant, being as he is old Jack Falstaff, banish not him thy Harry’s company, banish not him thy Harry’s company—banish plump Jack, and banish all the world.</li>

</div>

<ol data-speaker="MORT.">
  <li>These promises are fair, the parties sure,</li>
  <li>And our induction full of prosperous hope.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOT.">
  <li>Lord Mortimer, and cousin Glendower,</li>
  <li>Will you sit down?</li>
  <li>And uncle Worcester—a plague upon it!</li>
  <li>I have forgot the map.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLEND.">
  <li data-offset="5">No, here it is.</li>
  <li>Sit, cousin Percy, sit, good cousin Hotspur,</li>
  <li>For by that name as oft as Lancaster</li>
  <li>Doth speak of you, his cheek looks pale, and with</li>
  <li data-number="10">A rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOT.">
  <li>And you in hell, as oft as he hears</li>
  <li>Owen Glendower spoke of.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLEND.">
  <li>I cannot blame him. At my nativity</li>
  <li>The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes</li>
  <li data-number="15">Of burning cressets, and at my birth</li>
  <li>The frame and huge foundation of the earth</li>
  <li>Shak’d like a coward.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOT.">
  <li data-offset="4">Why, so it would have done</li>
  <li>At the same season if your mother’s cat had</li>
  <li>But kitten’d, though yourself had never been born.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLEND.">
  <li data-number="20">I say the earth did shake when I was born.</li>

<ol data-speaker="HOT.">
  <li>And I say the earth was not of my mind,</li>
  <li>If you suppose as fearing you it shook.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLEND.">
  <li>The heavens were all on fire, the earth did tremble.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOT.">
  <li>O then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire,</li>
  <li data-number="25">And not in fear of your nativity.</li>
  <li>Diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth</li>
  <li>In strange eruptions; oft the teeming earth</li>
  <li>Is with a kind of colic pinch’d and vex’d</li>
  <li>By the imprisoning of unruly wind</li>
  <li data-number="30">Within her womb, which, for enlargement striving,</li>
  <li>Shakes the old beldame earth, and topples down</li>
  <li>Steeples and moss-grown towers. At your birth</li>
  <li>Our grandam earth, having this distemp’rature,</li>
  <li>In passion shook.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLEND.">
  <li data-offset="4">Cousin, of many men</li>
  <li data-number="35">I do not bear these crossings. Give me leave</li>
  <li>To tell you once again that at my birth</li>
  <li>The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,</li>
  <li>The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds</li>
  <li>Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields.</li>
  <li data-number="40">These signs have mark’d me extraordinary,</li>
  <li>And all the courses of my life do show</li>
  <li>I am not in the roll of common men.</li>
  <li>Where is he living, clipt in with the sea</li>
  <li>That chides the banks of England, Scotland, Wales,</li>
  <li data-number="45">Which calls me pupil or hath read to me?</li>
  <li>And bring him out that is but woman’s son</li>
  <li>Can trace me in the tedious ways of art,</li>
  <li>And hold me pace in deep experiments.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOT.">
  <li>I think there’s no man speaks better Welsh.</li>
  <li data-number="50">I’ll to dinner.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MORT.">
  <li>Peace, cousin Percy, you will make him mad.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLEND.">
  <li>I can call spirits from the vasty deep.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOT.">
  <li>Why, so can I, or so can any man,</li>
  <li>But will they come when you do call for them?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLEND.">
  <li data-number="55">Why, I can teach you, cousin, to command</li>
  <li>The devil.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOT.">
  <li>And I can teach thee, coz, to shame the devil</li>
  <li>By telling truth: tell truth and shame the devil.</li>
  <li>If thou have power to raise him, bring him hither,</li>
  <li data-number="60">And I’ll be sworn I have power to shame him hence.</li>
  <li>O, while you live, tell truth and shame the devil!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MORT.">
  <li>Come, come, no more of this unprofitable chat.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLEND.">
  <li>Three times hath Henry Bullingbrook made head</li>
  <li>Against my power; thrice from the banks of Wye</li>

  <li>Bootless home and weather-beaten back.</li>

  <li>How scapes he agues, in the devil’s name?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLEND.">
  <li>Come, here is the map. Shall we divide our right</li>
  <li data-number="70">According to our threefold order ta’en?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MORT.">
  <li>The Archdeacon hath divided it</li>
  <li>Into three limits very equally:</li>
  <li>England, from Trent and Severn hitherto,</li>
  <li>By south and east is to my part assign’d;</li>
  <li data-number="75">All westward, Wales beyond the Severn shore,</li>
  <li>And all the fertile land within that bound,</li>
  <li>To Owen Glendower; and, dear coz, to you</li>
  <li>The remnant northward lying off from Trent.</li>
  <li>And our indentures tripartite are drawn,</li>
  <li data-number="80">Which being sealed interchangeably</li>
  <li>(A business that this night may execute),</li>
  <li>Tomorrow, cousin Percy, you and I</li>
  <li>And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth</li>
  <li>To meet your father and the Scottish power,</li>
  <li data-number="85">As is appointed us, at Shrewsbury.</li>
  <li>My father Glendower is not ready yet,</li>
  <li>Nor shall we need his help these fourteen days.</li>
  <li>Within that space you may have drawn together</li>
  <li>Your tenants, friends, and neighboring gentlemen.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLEND.">
  <li data-number="90">A shorter time shall send me to you, lords,</li>
  <li>And in my conduct shall your ladies come,</li>
  <li>From whom you now must steal and take no leave,</li>
  <li>For there will be a world of water shed</li>
  <li>Upon the parting of your wives and you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOT.">
  <li data-number="95">Methinks my moi’ty, north from Burton here,</li>
  <li>In quantity equals not one of yours.</li>
  <li>See how this river comes me cranking in,</li>
  <li>And cuts me from the best of all my land</li>
  <li>A huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle out.</li>
  <li data-number="100">I’ll have the current in this place damm’d up,</li>
  <li>And here the smug and silver Trent shall run</li>
  <li>In a new channel fair and evenly.</li>
  <li>It shall not wind with such a deep indent,</li>
  <li>To rob me of so rich a bottom here.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLEND.">
  <li data-number="105">Not wind? It shall, it must, you see it doth.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MORT.">
  <li>Yea, but</li>
  <li>Mark how he bears his course, and runs me up</li>
  <li>With like advantage on the other side,</li>
  <li>Gelding the opposed continent as much</li>
  <li data-number="110">As on the other side it takes from you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WOR.">
  <li>Yea, but a little charge will trench him here,</li>
  <li>And on this north side win this cape of land,</li>
  <li>And then he runs straight and even.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOT.">
  <li>I’ll have it so, a little charge will do it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLEND.">
  <li>I’ll not have it alt’red.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOT.">
  <li data-offset="4">Will not you?</li>

<ol data-speaker="GLEND.">
  <li>No, nor you shall not.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOT.">
  <li data-offset="4">Who shall say me nay?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLEND.">
  <li>Why, that will I.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOT.">
  <li data-offset="3">Let me not understand you then,</li>
  <li>Speak it in Welsh.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLEND.">
  <li>I can speak English, lord, as well as you,</li>
  <li data-number="120">For I was train’d up in the English court,</li>
  <li>Where being but young I framed to the harp</li>
  <li>Many an English ditty lovely well,</li>
  <li>And gave the tongue a helpful ornament,</li>
  <li>A virtue that was never seen in you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOT.">
  <li data-number="125">Marry,</li>
  <li>And I am glad of it with all my heart.</li>
  <li>I had rather be a kitten and cry mew</li>
  <li>Than one of these same metre ballet-mongers.</li>
  <li>I had rather hear a brazen canstick turn’d,</li>
  <li data-number="130">Or a dry wheel grate on the axle-tree,</li>
  <li>And that would set my teeth nothing an edge,</li>
  <li>Nothing so much as mincing poetry.</li>
  <li>’Tis like the forc’d gait of a shuffling nag.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLEND.">
  <li>Come, you shall have Trent turn’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOT.">
  <li data-number="135">I do not care. I’ll give thrice so much land</li>
  <li>To any well-deserving friend;</li>
  <li>But in the way of bargain, mark ye me,</li>
  <li>I’ll cavil on the ninth part of a hair.</li>
  <li>Are the indentures drawn? Shall we be gone?</li>

  <li data-number="150">A clip-wing’d griffin and a moulten raven,</li>

  <li>He held me last night at least nine hours</li>
  <li data-number="155">In reckoning up the several devils’ names</li>

<ol data-speaker="KING.">
  <li>Lords, give us leave, the Prince of Wales and I</li>
  <li>Must have some private conference, but be near at hand,</li>
  <li>For we shall presently have need of you.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">

		Lords
	
</li>
  <li>I know not whether God will have it so</li>
  <li data-number="5">For some displeasing service I have done,</li>
  <li>That in his secret doom, out of my blood</li>
  <li>He’ll breed revengement and a scourge for me;</li>
  <li>But thou dost in thy passages of life</li>
  <li>Make me believe that thou art only mark’d</li>
  <li data-number="10">For the hot vengeance, and the rod of heaven,</li>
  <li>To punish my mistreadings. Tell me else,</li>
  <li>Could such inordinate and low desires,</li>
  <li>Such poor, such bare, such lewd, such mean attempts,</li>
  <li>Such barren pleasures, rude society,</li>
  <li data-number="15">As thou art match’d withal and grafted to,</li>
  <li>Accompany the greatness of thy blood,</li>
  <li>And hold their level with thy princely heart?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li>So please your Majesty, I would I could</li>
  <li>Quit all offenses with as clear excuse</li>
  <li data-number="20">As well as I am doubtless I can purge</li>
  <li>Myself of many I am charg’d withal;</li>
  <li>Yet such extenuation let me beg</li>
  <li>As in reproof of many tales devis’d,</li>
  <li>Which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear</li>
  <li data-number="25">By smiling pick-thanks and base newsmongers,</li>
  <li>I may for some things true, wherein my youth</li>
  <li>Hath faulty wand’red and irregular,</li>
  <li>Find pardon on my true submission.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING.">
  <li>God pardon thee! Yet let me wonder, Harry,</li>
  <li data-number="30">At thy affections, which do hold a wing</li>
  <li>Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors.</li>
  <li>Thy place in Council thou hast rudely lost,</li>
  <li>Which by thy younger brother is supplied,</li>
  <li>And art almost an alien to the hearts</li>
  <li data-number="35">Of all the court and princes of my blood;</li>
  <li>The hope and expectation of thy time</li>
  <li>Is ruin’d, and the soul of every man</li>
  <li>Prophetically do forethink thy fall.</li>
  <li>Had I so lavish of my presence been,</li>
  <li data-number="40">So common-hackney’d in the eyes of men,</li>
  <li>So stale and cheap to vulgar company,</li>
  <li>Opinion, that did help me to the crown,</li>
  <li>Had still kept loyal to possession,</li>
  <li>And left me in reputeless banishment,</li>
  <li data-number="45">A fellow of no mark nor likelihood.</li>
  <li>By being seldom seen, I could not stir</li>
  <li>But like a comet I was wond’red at,</li>
  <li>That men would tell their children, “This is he”;</li>
  <li>Others would say, “Where, which is Bullingbrook?”</li>
  <li data-number="50">And then I stole all courtesy from heaven,</li>
  <li>And dress’d myself in such humility</li>
  <li>That I did pluck allegiance from men’s hearts,</li>
  <li>Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths,</li>
  <li>Even in the presence of the crowned King.</li>
  <li data-number="55">Thus did I keep my person fresh and new,</li>
  <li>My presence, like a robe pontifical,</li>
  <li>Ne’er seen but wond’red at, and so my state,</li>
  <li>Seldom but sumptuous, show’d like a feast,</li>
  <li>And wan by rareness such solemnity.</li>
  <li data-number="60">The skipping King, he ambled up and down,</li>
  <li>With shallow jesters, and rash bavin wits,</li>
  <li>Soon kindled and soon burnt, carded his state,</li>
  <li>Mingled his royalty with cap’ring fools,</li>
  <li>Had his great name profaned with their scorns,</li>
  <li data-number="65">And gave his countenance, against his name,</li>
  <li>To laugh at gibing boys, and stand the push</li>
  <li>Of every beardless vain comparative,</li>
  <li>Grew a companion to the common streets,</li>
  <li>Enfeoff’d himself to popularity,</li>
  <li data-number="70">That, being daily swallowed by men’s eyes,</li>
  <li>They surfeited with honey and began</li>
  <li>To loathe the taste of sweetness, whereof a little</li>
  <li>More than a little is by much too much.</li>
  <li>So when he had occasion to be seen,</li>
  <li data-number="75">He was but as the cuckoo is in June,</li>
  <li>Heard, not regarded; seen, but with such eyes</li>
  <li>As, sick and blunted with community,</li>
  <li>Afford no extraordinary gaze,</li>
  <li>Such as is bent on sunlike majesty</li>
  <li data-number="80">When it shines seldom in admiring eyes;</li>
  <li>But rather drows’d and hung their eyelids down,</li>
  <li>Slept in his face and rend’red such aspect</li>
  <li>As cloudy men use to their adversaries,</li>
  <li>Being with his presence glutted, gorg’d, and full.</li>
  <li data-number="85">And in that very line, Harry, standest thou,</li>
  <li>For thou hast lost thy princely privilege</li>
  <li>With vile participation. Not an eye</li>
  <li>But is a-weary of thy common sight,</li>
  <li>Save mine, which hath desir’d to see thee more,</li>
  <li data-number="90">Which now doth that I would not have it do,</li>
  <li>Make blind itself with foolish tenderness.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li>I shall hereafter, my thrice-gracious lord,</li>
  <li>Be more myself.</li>
</ol>

  <li>For all the world</li>
  <li data-number="95">As thou art to this hour was Richard then</li>
  <li>When I from France set foot at Ravenspurgh,</li>
  <li>And even as I was then is Percy now.</li>
  <li>Now by my sceptre, and my soul to boot,</li>
  <li>He hath more worthy interest to the state</li>
  <li data-number="100">Than thou the shadow of succession.</li>
  <li>For of no right, nor color like to right,</li>
  <li>He doth fill fields with harness in the realm,</li>
  <li>Turns head against the lion’s armed jaws,</li>
  <li>And being no more in debt to years than thou,</li>
  <li data-number="105">Leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on</li>
  <li>To bloody battles and to bruising arms.</li>
  <li>What never-dying honor hath he got</li>
  <li>Against renowned Douglas! Whose high deeds,</li>
  <li>Whose hot incursions and great name in arms,</li>
  <li data-number="110">Holds from all soldiers chief majority</li>
  <li>And military title capital</li>
  <li>Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ.</li>
  <li>Thrice hath this Hotspur, Mars in swathling clothes,</li>
  <li>This infant warrior, in his enterprises</li>
  <li data-number="115">Discomfited great Douglas, ta’en him once,</li>
  <li>Enlarg’d him and made a friend of him,</li>
  <li>To fill the mouth of deep defiance up,</li>
  <li>And shake the peace and safety of our throne.</li>
  <li>And what say you to this? Percy, Northumberland,</li>
  <li data-number="120">The Archbishop’s grace of York, Douglas, Mortimer,</li>
  <li>Capitulate against us, and are up.</li>
  <li>But wherefore do I tell these news to thee?</li>
  <li>Why, Harry, do I tell thee of my foes,</li>
  <li>Which art my nearest and dearest enemy?</li>
  <li data-number="125">Thou that art like enough, through vassal fear,</li>
  <li>Base inclination, and the start of spleen,</li>
  <li>To fight against me under Percy’s pay,</li>
  <li>To dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns,</li>
  <li>To show how much thou art degenerate.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li data-number="130">Do not think so, you shall not find it so,</li>
  <li>And God forgive them that so much have sway’d</li>
  <li>Your Majesty’s good thoughts away from me!</li>
  <li>I will redeem all this on Percy’s head,</li>
  <li>And in the closing of some glorious day</li>
  <li data-number="135">Be bold to tell you that I am your son,</li>
  <li>When I will wear a garment all of blood,</li>

  <li>For every honor sitting on his helm,</li>
  <li>Would they were multitudes, and on my head</li>
  <li data-number="145">My shames redoubled! For the time will come</li>
  <li>That I shall make this northern youth exchange</li>
  <li>His glorious deeds for my indignities.</li>
  <li>Percy is but my factor, good my lord,</li>
  <li>To engross up glorious deeds on my behalf;</li>
  <li data-number="150">And I will call him to so strict account</li>
  <li>That he shall render every glory up,</li>
  <li>Yea, even the slightest worship of his time,</li>

  <li>This in the name of God I promise here,</li>
  <li data-number="155">The which if he be pleas’d I shall perform,</li>

		FAL.
		BARD.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li>Bardolph, am I not fall’n away vilely since this last action? Do I not bate? Do I not dwindle? Why, my skin hangs about me like an old lady’s loose gown; I am wither’d like an old apple-john. Well, I’ll repent, and that suddenly, while I am in some liking. I shall be out of heart shortly, and then I shall have no strength to repent. And I have not forgotten what the inside of a church is made of, I am a peppercorn, a brewer’s horse. The inside of a church! Company, villainous company, hath been the spoil of me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BARD.">
  <li>Sir John, you are so fretful you cannot live long.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li>Why, there is it. Come sing me a bawdy song, make me merry. I was as virtuously given as a gentleman need to be, virtuous enough: swore little, dic’d not above seven times—a week, went to a bawdy-house not above once in a quarter—of an hour, paid money that I borrow’d—three or four times, liv’d well and in good compass, and now I live out of all order, out of all compass.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BARD.">
  <li>Why, you are so fat, Sir John, that you must needs be out of all compass, out of all reasonable compass, Sir John.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li data-number="5">Do thou amend thy face, and I’ll amend my life. Thou art our admiral, thou bearest the lantern in the poop, but ’tis in the nose of thee. Thou art the Knight of the Burning Lamp.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BARD.">
  <li>Why, Sir John, my face does you no harm.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li>No, I’ll be sworn, I make as good use of it as many a man doth of a death’s-head or a <foreign xml:lang="la">memento mori</foreign>. I never see thy face but I think upon hell-fire and Dives that liv’d in purple; for there he is in his robes, burning, burning. If thou wert any way given to virtue, I would swear by thy face; my oath should be “By this fire, that’s God’s angel.” But thou art altogether given over, and wert indeed, but for the light in thy face, the son of utter darkness. When thou ran’st up Gadshill in the night to catch my horse, if I did not think thou hadst been an <foreign xml:lang="la">ignis fatuus</foreign> or a ball of wildfire, there’s no purchase in money. O, thou art a perpetual triumph, an everlasting bonfire light! Thou hast sav’d me a thousand marks in links and torches, walking with thee in the night betwixt tavern and tavern; but the sack that thou hast drunk me would have bought me lights as good cheap at the dearest chandler’s in Europe. I have maintain’d that salamander of yours with fire any time this two and thirty years, God reward me for it!</li>

  <li>Why, Sir John, what do you think, Sir John? Do you think I keep thieves in my house? I have search’d, I have inquir’d, so has my husband, man by man, boy by boy, servant by servant. The tithe of a hair was never lost in my house before.</li>
</ol>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOST.">
  <li data-number="15">No, Sir John, you do not know me, Sir John. I know you, Sir John, you owe me money, Sir John, and now you pick a quarrel to beguile me of it. I bought you a dozen of shirts to your back.</li>

  <li>Dowlas, filthy dowlas. I have given them away to bakers’ wives, they have made bolters of them.</li>
</ol>

  <li>Now as I am a true woman, holland of eight shillings an ell. You owe money here besides, Sir John, for your diet and by-drinkings, and money lent you, four and twenty pound.</li>

  <li>He had his part of it, let him pay.</li>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li data-number="20">How? Poor? Look upon his face; what call you rich? Let them coin his nose, let them coin his cheeks. I’ll not pay a denier. What, will you make a younker of me? Shall I not take mine ease in mine inn but I shall have my pocket pick’d? I have lost a seal-ring of my grandfather’s worth forty mark.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOST.">
  <li>O Jesu, I have heard the Prince tell him, I know not how oft, that that ring was copper!</li>

  <li>Nay, my lord, he call’d you Jack, and said he would cudgel you.</li>

  <li>Did I, Bardolph?</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li>And why not as the lion?</li>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li>The King himself is to be fear’d as the lion. Dost thou think I’ll fear thee as I fear thy father? Nay, and I do, I pray God my girdle break.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li>O, if it should, how would thy guts fall about thy knees! But, sirrah, there’s no room for faith, truth, nor honesty in this bosom of thine; it is all fill’d up with guts and midriff. Charge an honest woman with picking thy pocket! Why, thou whoreson, impudent, emboss’d rascal, if there were any thing in thy pocket but tavern-reckonings, memorandums of bawdy-houses, and one poor pennyworth of sugar-candy to make thee long-winded—if thy pocket were enrich’d with any other injuries but these, I am a villain. And yet you will stand to it, you will not pocket up wrong. Art thou not asham’d?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li data-number="60">Dost thou hear, Hal? Thou knowest in the state of innocency Adam fell, and what should poor Jack Falstaff do in the days of villainy? Thou seest I have more flesh than another man, and therefore more frailty. You confess then you pick’d my pocket?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li>It appears so by the story.</li>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li>Hostess, I forgive thee. Go make ready breakfast; love thy husband, look to thy servants, cherish thy guests. Thou shalt find me tractable to any honest reason; thou seest I am pacified still. Nay, prithee be gone.</li>

  <li>O, my sweet beef, I must still be good angel to thee. The money is paid back again.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li data-number="65">O, I do not like that paying back, ’tis a double labor.</li>

  <li>These letters come from your father.</li>

<ol data-speaker="HOT.">
  <li data-number="15">Letters from him! Why comes he not himself?</li>

<ol data-speaker="1. MESS.">
  <li>He cannot come, my lord, he is grievous sick.</li>

<ol data-speaker="1. MESS.">
  <li>He did, my lord, four days ere I set forth,</li>
  <li>And at the time of my departure thence</li>
  <li>He was much fear’d by his physicians.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WOR.">
  <li data-number="25">I would the state of time had first been whole</li>
  <li>Ere he by sickness had been visited,</li>
  <li>His health was never better worth than now.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOT.">
  <li>Sick now? Droop now? This sickness doth infect</li>
  <li>The very life-blood of our enterprise,</li>
  <li data-number="30">’Tis catching hither, even to our camp.</li>
  <li>He writes me here, that inward sickness—</li>
  <li>And that his friends by deputation could not</li>
  <li>So soon be drawn, nor did he think it meet</li>
  <li>To lay so dangerous and dear a trust</li>
  <li data-number="35">On any soul remov’d, but on his own.</li>
  <li>Yet doth he give us bold advertisement</li>
  <li>That with our small conjunction we should on,</li>
  <li>To see how fortune is dispos’d to us,</li>
  <li>For, as he writes, there is no quailing now,</li>
  <li data-number="40">Because the King is certainly possess’d</li>
  <li>Of all our purposes. What say you to it?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WOR.">
  <li>Your father’s sickness is a maim to us.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOT.">
  <li>A perilous gash, a very limb lopp’d off—</li>
  <li>And yet, in faith, it is not; his present want</li>
  <li data-number="45">Seems more than we shall find it. Were it good</li>
  <li>To set the exact wealth of all our states</li>
  <li>All at one cast? To set so rich a main</li>
  <li>On the nice hazard of one doubtful hour?</li>
  <li>It were not good, for therein should we read</li>
  <li data-number="50">The very bottom and the soul of hope,</li>
  <li>The very list, the very utmost bound</li>
  <li>Of all our fortunes.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DOUG.">
  <li data-offset="4">Faith, and so we should,</li>
  <li>Where now remains a sweet reversion,</li>
  <li>We may boldly spend upon the hope of what</li>
  <li data-number="55">Is to come in.</li>
  <li>A comfort of retirement lives in this.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOT.">
  <li>A rendezvous, a home to fly unto,</li>

  <li>Upon the maidenhead of our affairs.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WOR.">
  <li data-number="60">But yet I would your father had been here.</li>
  <li>The quality and hair of our attempt</li>
  <li>Brooks no division. It will be thought</li>
  <li>By some that know not why he is away</li>
  <li>That wisdom, loyalty, and mere dislike</li>
  <li data-number="65">Of our proceedings kept the Earl from hence,</li>
  <li>And think how such an apprehension</li>
  <li>May turn the tide of fearful faction,</li>
  <li>And breed a kind of question in our cause.</li>
  <li>For well you know we of the off’ring side</li>
  <li data-number="70">Must keep aloof from strict arbitrement,</li>
  <li>And stop all sight-holes, every loop from whence</li>
  <li>The eye of reason may pry in upon us.</li>
  <li>This absence of your father’s draws a curtain</li>
  <li>That shows the ignorant a kind of fear</li>
  <li>Before not dreamt of.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOT.">
  <li data-number="75" data-offset="4">You strain too far.</li>
  <li>I rather of his absence make this use:</li>
  <li>It lends a lustre and more great opinion,</li>
  <li>A larger dare to our great enterprise,</li>
  <li>Than if the Earl were here, for men must think,</li>
  <li data-number="80">If we without his help can make a head</li>
  <li>To push against a kingdom, with his help</li>
  <li>We shall o’erturn it topsy-turvy down.</li>
  <li>Yet all goes well, yet all our joints are whole.</li>

  <li>If I be not asham’d of my soldiers, I am a sous’d gurnet. I have misus’d the King’s press damnably. I have got, in exchange of a hundred and fifty soldiers, three hundred and odd pounds. I press me none but good householders, yeomen’s sons, inquire me out contracted bachelors, such as had been ask’d twice on the banes, such a commodity of warm slaves, as had as lief hear the devil as a drum, such as fear the report of a caliver worse than a struck fowl or a hurt wild duck. I press’d me none but such toasts-and-butter, with hearts in their bellies no bigger than pins’ heads, and they have bought out their services; and now my whole charge consists of ancients, corporals, lieutenants, gentlemen of companies—slaves as ragged as Lazarus in the painted cloth, where the glutton’s dogs lick’d his sores, and such as indeed were never soldiers, but discarded unjust servingmen, younger sons to younger brothers, revolted tapsters, and ostlers trade-fall’n, the cankers of a calm world and a long peace, ten times more dishonorable ragged than an old feaz’d ancient: and such have I, to fill up the rooms of them as have bought out their services, that you would think that I had a hundred and fifty totter’d prodigals lately come from swine-keeping, from eating draff and husks. A mad fellow met me on the way and told me I had unloaded all the gibbets and press’d the dead bodies. No eye hath seen such scarecrows. I’ll not march through Coventry with them, that’s flat. Nay, and the villains march wide betwixt the legs, as if they had gyves on, for indeed I had the most of them out of prison. There’s not a shirt and a half in all my company, and the half shirt is two napkins tack’d together and thrown over the shoulders like a herald’s coat without sleeves; and the shirt, to say the truth, stol’n from my host at Saint Albans, or the red-nose innkeeper of Daventry.

  <li>Welcome, Sir Walter Blunt; and would to God</li>
  <li>You were of our determination!</li>
  <li>Some of us love you well, and even those some</li>
  <li data-number="35">Envy your great deservings and good name,</li>
  <li>Because you are not of our quality,</li>
  <li>But stand against us like an enemy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BLUNT.">
  <li>And God defend but still I should stand so,</li>
  <li>So long as out of limit and true rule</li>
  <li data-number="40">You stand against anointed majesty.</li>
  <li>But to my charge. The King hath sent to know</li>
  <li>The nature of your griefs, and whereupon</li>
  <li>You conjure from the breast of civil peace</li>
  <li>Such bold hostility, teaching his duteous land</li>
  <li data-number="45">Audacious cruelty. If that the King</li>
  <li>Have any way your good deserts forgot,</li>
  <li>Which he confesseth to be manifold,</li>
  <li>He bids you name your griefs, and with all speed</li>
  <li>You shall have your desires with interest</li>

  <li>Herein misled by your suggestion.</li>

<ol data-speaker="HOT.">
  <li>The King is kind, and well we know the King</li>
  <li>Knows at what time to promise, when to pay.</li>
  <li>My father and my uncle and myself</li>
  <li data-number="55">Did give him that same royalty he wears,</li>
  <li>And when he was not six and twenty strong,</li>
  <li>Sick in the world’s regard, wretched and low,</li>
  <li>A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home,</li>
  <li>My father gave him welcome to the shore;</li>
  <li data-number="60">And when he heard him swear and vow to God</li>
  <li>He came but to be Duke of Lancaster,</li>
  <li>To sue his livery and beg his peace,</li>
  <li>With tears of innocency and terms of zeal,</li>
  <li>My father, in kind heart and pity mov’d,</li>
  <li data-number="65">Swore him assistance, and perform’d it too.</li>
  <li>Now when the lords and barons of the realm</li>
  <li>Perceiv’d Northumberland did lean to him,</li>
  <li>The more and less came in with cap and knee,</li>
  <li>Met him in boroughs, cities, villages,</li>
  <li data-number="70">Attended him on bridges, stood in lanes,</li>
  <li>Laid gifts before him, proffer’d him their oaths,</li>
  <li>Gave him their heirs as pages, followed him</li>
  <li>Even at the heels in golden multitudes.</li>
  <li>He presently, as greatness knows itself,</li>
  <li data-number="75">Steps me a little higher than his vow</li>
  <li>Made to my father, while his blood was poor,</li>
  <li>Upon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh,</li>
  <li>And now forsooth takes on him to reform</li>
  <li>Some certain edicts and some strait decrees</li>
  <li data-number="80">That lie too heavy on the commonwealth,</li>
  <li>Cries out upon abuses, seems to weep</li>
  <li>Over his country’s wrongs, and by this face,</li>
  <li>This seeming brow of justice, did he win</li>
  <li>The hearts of all that he did angle for;</li>
  <li data-number="85">Proceeded further—cut me off the heads</li>
  <li>Of all the favorites that the absent King</li>
  <li>In deputation left behind him here,</li>
  <li>When he was personal in the Irish war.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BLUNT.">
  <li>Tut, I came not to hear this.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOT.">
  <li data-offset="5">Then to the point.</li>
  <li data-number="90">In short time after, he depos’d the King,</li>
  <li>Soon after that, depriv’d him of his life,</li>
  <li>And in the neck of that, task’d the whole state;</li>
  <li>To make that worse, suff’red his kinsman March</li>
  <li>(Who is, if every owner were well plac’d,</li>
  <li data-number="95">Indeed his king) to be engag’d in Wales,</li>
  <li>There without ransom to lie forfeited;</li>
  <li>Disgrac’d me in my happy victories,</li>
  <li>Sought to entrap me by intelligence,</li>
  <li>Rated mine uncle from the Council-board,</li>
  <li data-number="100">In rage dismiss’d my father from the court,</li>
  <li>Broke oath on oath, committed wrong on wrong,</li>
  <li>And in conclusion drove us to seek out</li>
  <li>This head of safety, and withal to pry</li>
  <li>Into his title, the which we find</li>
  <li data-number="105">Too indirect for long continuance.</li>

  <li>Shall I return this answer to the King?</li>

  <li>Not so, Sir Walter; we’ll withdraw a while.</li>

  <li>And what with Owen Glendower’s absence thence,</li>

  <li>I fear the power of Percy is too weak</li>

<ol data-speaker="SIR M.">
  <li>Why, my good lord, you need not fear,</li>

  <li>Nor claim no further than your new-fall’n right,</li>

  <li>That all in England did repute him dead;</li>
  <li data-number="55">And from this swarm of fair advantages</li>
  <li>You took occasion to be quickly wooed</li>

  <li>For fear of swallowing; but with nimble wing</li>
  <li data-number="65">We were enforc’d for safety sake to fly</li>
  <li>Out of your sight and raise this present head,</li>
