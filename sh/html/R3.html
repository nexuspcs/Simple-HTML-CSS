<h3>Scene 1</h3>

<h4>London. A street.</h4>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Richard Duke of Gloucester solus.
	
		GLOU.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>Now is the winter of our discontent</li>
  <li>Made glorious summer by this son of York;</li>
  <li>And all the clouds that low’r’d upon our house</li>
  <li>In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.</li>
  <li data-number="5">Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths,</li>
  <li>Our bruised arms hung up for monuments,</li>
  <li>Our stern alarums chang’d to merry meetings,</li>
  <li>Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.</li>
  <li>Grim-visag’d War hath smooth’d his wrinkled front;</li>
  <li data-number="10">And now, in stead of mounting barbed steeds</li>
  <li>To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,</li>
  <li>He capers nimbly in a lady’s chamber</li>
  <li>To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.</li>
  <li>But I, that am not shap’d for sportive tricks,</li>
  <li data-number="15">Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;</li>
  <li>I, that am rudely stamp’d, and want love’s majesty</li>
  <li>To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;</li>
  <li>I, that am curtail’d of this fair proportion,</li>
  <li>Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,</li>
  <li data-number="20">Deform’d, unfinish’d, sent before my time</li>
  <li>Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,</li>
  <li>And that so lamely and unfashionable</li>
  <li>That dogs bark at me as I halt by them—</li>
  <li>Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,</li>
  <li data-number="25">Have no delight to pass away the time,</li>
  <li>Unless to see my shadow in the sun</li>
  <li>And descant on mine own deformity.</li>
  <li>And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover</li>
  <li>To entertain these fair well-spoken days,</li>
  <li data-number="30">I am determined to prove a villain</li>
  <li>And hate the idle pleasures of these days.</li>
  <li>Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,</li>
  <li>By drunken prophecies, libels, and dreams,</li>
  <li>To set my brother Clarence and the King</li>
  <li data-number="35">In deadly hate the one against the other;</li>
  <li>And if King Edward be as true and just</li>
  <li>As I am subtle, false, and treacherous,</li>
  <li>This day should Clarence closely be mew’d up</li>
  <li>About a prophecy, which says that G</li>
  <li data-number="40">Of Edward’s heirs the murderer shall be.</li>
  <li>Dive, thoughts, down to my soul, here Clarence comes!</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">
	Enter Clarence, guarded, and Brakenbury, Lieutenant of the Tower.
	
		CLAR.
		BRAK.
		Guard
	
</li>
  <li>Brother, good day. What means this armed guard</li>
  <li>That waits upon your Grace?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAR.">
  <li data-offset="6">His Majesty,</li>
  <li>Tend’ring my person’s safety, hath appointed</li>
  <li>This conduct to convey me to the Tower.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>Upon what cause?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAR.">
  <li data-offset="4">Because my name is George.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours;</li>
  <li>He should for that commit your godfathers.</li>
  <li>O, belike his Majesty hath some intent</li>
  <li data-number="50">That you should be new christ’ned in the Tower.</li>
  <li>But what’s the matter, Clarence, may I know?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAR.">
  <li>Yea, Richard, when I know; but I protest</li>
  <li>As yet I do not. But, as I can learn,</li>
  <li>He hearkens after prophecies and dreams,</li>
  <li data-number="55">And from the cross-row plucks the letter G,</li>
  <li>And says a wizard told him that by G</li>
  <li>His issue disinherited should be;</li>
  <li>And for my name of George begins with G,</li>
  <li>It follows in his thought that I am he.</li>
  <li data-number="60">These (as I learn) and such-like toys as these</li>
  <li>Hath mov’d his Highness to commit me now.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>Why, this it is, when men are rul’d by women:</li>
  <li>’Tis not the King that sends you to the Tower;</li>
  <li>My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, ’tis she</li>
  <li data-number="65">That tempers him to this extremity.</li>
  <li>Was it not she, and that good man of worship,</li>
  <li>Anthony Woodvile, her brother there,</li>
  <li>That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,</li>
  <li>From whence this present day he is delivered?</li>
  <li data-number="70">We are not safe, Clarence, we are not safe.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAR.">
  <li>By heaven, I think there is no man is secure</li>
  <li>But the Queen’s kindred, and night-walking heralds</li>
  <li>That trudge betwixt the King and Mistress Shore.</li>
  <li>Heard you not what an humble suppliant</li>
  <li data-number="75">Lord Hastings was to her for his delivery?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>Humbly complaining to her deity</li>
  <li>Got my Lord Chamberlain his liberty.</li>
  <li>I’ll tell you what, I think it is our way,</li>
  <li>If we will keep in favor with the King,</li>
  <li data-number="80">To be her men and wear her livery.</li>
  <li>The jealous o’erworn widow and herself,</li>
  <li>Since that our brother dubb’d them gentlewomen,</li>
  <li>Are mighty gossips in our monarchy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BRAK.">
  <li>I beseech your Graces both to pardon me:</li>
  <li data-number="85">His Majesty hath straitly given in charge</li>
  <li>That no man shall have private conference</li>
  <li>(Of what degree soever) with your brother.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>Even so? And please your worship, Brakenbury,</li>
  <li>You may partake of any thing we say:</li>
  <li data-number="90">We speak no treason, man. We say the King</li>
  <li>Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen</li>
  <li>Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous;</li>
  <li>We say that Shore’s wife hath a pretty foot,</li>
  <li>A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;</li>
  <li data-number="95">And that the Queen’s kindred are made gentlefolks.</li>
  <li>How say you, sir? Can you deny all this?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BRAK.">
  <li>With this, my lord, myself have nought to do.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>Naught to do with Mistress Shore? I tell thee, fellow,</li>
  <li>He that doth naught with her (excepting one)</li>
  <li data-number="100">Were best to do it secretly alone.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BRAK.">
  <li>What one, my lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>Her husband, knave. Wouldst thou betray me?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BRAK.">
  <li>I do beseech your Grace to pardon me, and withal</li>
  <li>Forbear your conference with the noble Duke.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAR.">
  <li data-number="105">We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>We are the Queen’s abjects, and must obey.</li>
  <li>Brother, farewell, I will unto the King,</li>
  <li>And whatsoe’er you will employ me in,</li>
  <li>Were it to call King Edward’s widow sister,</li>
  <li data-number="110">I will perform it to enfranchise you.</li>
  <li>Mean time, this deep disgrace in brotherhood</li>
  <li>Touches me deeper than you can imagine.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAR.">
  <li>I know it pleaseth neither of us well.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>Well, your imprisonment shall not be long,</li>
  <li>I will deliver you, or else lie for you.</li>
  <li>Mean time, have patience.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAR.">
  <li data-offset="6">I must perforce. Farewell.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Exit Clarence with Brakenbury and Guard.
	
		CLAR.
		BRAK.
		Guard
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>Go tread the path that thou shalt ne’er return:</li>
  <li>Simple plain Clarence, I do love thee so</li>
  <li>That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,</li>
  <li data-number="120">If heaven will take the present at our hands.</li>
  <li>But who comes here? The new-delivered Hastings?</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Lord Hastings.
	
		HAST.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="HAST.">
  <li>Good time of day unto my gracious lord!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>As much unto my good Lord Chamberlain!</li>
  <li>Well are you welcome to the open air.</li>
  <li data-number="125">How hath your lordship brook’d imprisonment?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAST.">
  <li>With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must;</li>
  <li>But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks</li>
  <li>That were the cause of my imprisonment.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>No doubt, no doubt, and so shall Clarence too,</li>
  <li data-number="130">For they that were your enemies are his,</li>
  <li>And have prevail’d as much on him as you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAST.">
  <li>More pity that the eagles should be mew’d,</li>
  <li>Whiles kites and buzzards prey at liberty.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>What news abroad?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAST.">
  <li data-number="135">No news so bad abroad as this at home:</li>
  <li>The King is sickly, weak, and melancholy,</li>
  <li>And his physicians fear him mightily.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>Now by Saint John, that news is bad indeed!</li>
  <li>O, he hath kept an evil diet long,</li>
  <li data-number="140">And overmuch consum’d his royal person:</li>
  <li>’Tis very grievous to be thought upon.</li>
  <li>Where is he? In his bed?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAST.">
  <li>He is.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>Go you before, and I will follow you.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">
	Exit Hastings.
	
		HAST.
	
</li>
  <li data-number="145">He cannot live, I hope, and must not die</li>
  <li>Till George be pack’d with post-horse up to heaven.</li>
  <li>I’ll in, to urge his hatred more to Clarence</li>
  <li>With lies well steel’d with weighty arguments,</li>
  <li>And if I fail not in my deep intent,</li>
  <li data-number="150">Clarence hath not another day to live:</li>
  <li>Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy,</li>
  <li>And leave the world for me to bustle in!</li>
  <li>For then I’ll marry Warwick’s youngest daughter.</li>
  <li>What though I kill’d her husband and her father?</li>
  <li data-number="155">The readiest way to make the wench amends</li>
  <li>Is to become her husband and her father:</li>
  <li>The which will I, not all so much for love</li>
  <li>As for another secret close intent</li>
  <li>By marrying her which I must reach unto.</li>
  <li data-number="160">But yet I run before my horse to market:</li>
  <li>Clarence still breathes, Edward still lives and reigns;</li>
  <li>When they are gone, then must I count my gains.</li>

  <li>Set down, set down your honorable load,</li>
  <li>If honor may be shrouded in a hearse,</li>
  <li>Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament</li>
  <li>Th’ untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.</li>
  <li data-number="5">Poor key-cold figure of a holy king,</li>
  <li>Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster,</li>
  <li>Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood,</li>
  <li>Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost</li>
  <li>To hear the lamentations of poor Anne,</li>
  <li data-number="10">Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaught’red son,</li>
  <li>Stabb’d by the self-same hand that made these wounds!</li>
  <li>Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life</li>
  <li>I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.</li>
  <li>O, cursed be the hand that made these holes!</li>
  <li data-number="15">Cursed the heart that had the heart to do it!</li>
  <li>Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence!</li>
  <li>More direful hap betide that hated wretch</li>
  <li>That makes us wretched by the death of thee</li>
  <li>Than I can wish to wolves—to spiders, toads,</li>
  <li data-number="20">Or any creeping venom’d thing that lives!</li>
  <li>If ever he have child, abortive be it,</li>
  <li>Prodigious, and untimely brought to light,</li>

  <li>If ever he have wife, let her be made</li>

  <li>Come now towards Chertsey with your holy load,</li>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down.</li>

<ol data-speaker="ANNE.">
  <li>What black magician conjures up this fiend</li>
  <li data-number="35">To stop devoted charitable deeds?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>Villains, set down the corse, or, by Saint Paul,</li>
  <li>I’ll make a corse of him that disobeys.</li>

<ol data-speaker="GENT.">
  <li>My lord, stand back, and let the coffin pass.</li>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>Unmanner’d dog, stand thou when I command.</li>
  <li data-number="40">Advance thy halberd higher than my breast,</li>
  <li>Or by Saint Paul I’ll strike thee to my foot,</li>
  <li>And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness.</li>

<ol data-speaker="ANNE.">
  <li>What do you tremble? Are you all afraid?</li>
  <li>Alas, I blame you not, for you are mortal,</li>
  <li data-number="45">And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil.—</li>
  <li>Avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hell!</li>
  <li>Thou hadst but power over his mortal body,</li>
  <li>His soul thou canst not have. Therefore be gone.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANNE.">
  <li data-number="50">Foul devil, for God’s sake hence, and trouble us not,</li>
  <li>For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell,</li>
  <li>Fill’d it with cursing cries and deep exclaims.</li>
  <li>If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,</li>
  <li>Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.</li>
  <li data-number="55">O gentlemen, see, see dead Henry’s wounds</li>
  <li>Open their congeal’d mouths and bleed afresh!</li>
  <li>Blush, blush, thou lump of foul deformity;</li>
  <li>For ’tis thy presence that exhales this blood</li>
  <li>From cold and empty veins where no blood dwells.</li>
  <li data-number="60">Thy deeds inhuman and unnatural</li>
  <li>Provokes this deluge most unnatural.</li>
  <li>O God! Which this blood mad’st, revenge his death!</li>
  <li>O earth! Which this blood drink’st, revenge his death!</li>
  <li>Either heav’n with lightning strike the murd’rer dead;</li>
  <li data-number="65">Or earth gape open wide and eat him quick,</li>
  <li>As thou dost swallow up this good king’s blood,</li>
  <li>Which his hell-govern’d arm hath butchered!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>Lady, you know no rules of charity,</li>
  <li>Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANNE.">
  <li data-number="70">Villain, thou know’st nor law of God nor man:</li>
  <li>No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.</li>

  <li>But I know none, and therefore am no beast.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANNE.">
  <li>O wonderful, when devils tell the troth!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>More wonderful, when angels are so angry.</li>
  <li data-number="75">Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,</li>
  <li>Of these supposed crimes, to give me leave</li>
  <li>By circumstance but to acquit myself.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANNE.">
  <li>Vouchsafe, defus’d infection of a man,</li>
  <li>Of these known evils, but to give me leave</li>
  <li data-number="80">By circumstance t’ accuse thy cursed self.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have</li>
  <li>Some patient leisure to excuse myself.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANNE.">
  <li>Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make</li>
  <li>No excuse current but to hang thyself.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li data-number="85">By such despair I should accuse myself.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANNE.">
  <li>And by despairing shalt thou stand excused</li>
  <li>For doing worthy vengeance on thyself,</li>
  <li>That didst unworthy slaughter upon others.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>Say that I slew them not?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANNE.">
  <li data-number="90">Then say they were not slain.</li>
  <li>But dead they are, and, devilish slave, by thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>I did not kill your husband.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANNE.">
  <li data-offset="5">Why then he is alive.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>Nay, he is dead, and slain by Edward’s hands.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANNE.">
  <li>In thy foul throat thou li’st! Queen Margaret saw</li>
  <li data-number="95">Thy murd’rous falchion smoking in his blood;</li>
  <li>The which thou once didst bend against her breast,</li>
  <li>But that thy brothers beat aside the point.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>I was provoked by her sland’rous tongue,</li>
  <li>That laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANNE.">
  <li data-number="100">Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind,</li>
  <li>That never dream’st on aught but butcheries.</li>
  <li>Didst thou not kill this king?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li data-offset="7">I grant ye.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANNE.">
  <li>Dost grant me, hedgehog? Then God grant me too</li>
  <li>Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed!</li>
  <li data-number="105">O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>The better for the King of Heaven that hath him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANNE.">
  <li>He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>Let him thank me that holp to send him thither;</li>
  <li>For he was fitter for that place than earth.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANNE.">
  <li data-number="110">And thou unfit for any place, but hell.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANNE.">
  <li>Some dungeon.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li data-offset="5">Your bedchamber.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANNE.">
  <li>Ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>So will it, madam, till I lie with you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANNE.">
  <li data-number="115">I hope so.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,</li>
  <li>To leave this keen encounter of our wits</li>
  <li>And fall something into a slower method:</li>
  <li>Is not the causer of the timeless deaths</li>
  <li data-number="120">Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,</li>
  <li>As blameful as the executioner?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANNE.">
  <li>Thou wast the cause, and most accurs’d effect.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>Your beauty was the cause of that effect—</li>
  <li>Your beauty, that did haunt me in my sleep</li>
  <li data-number="125">To undertake the death of all the world,</li>
  <li>So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANNE.">
  <li>If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,</li>
  <li>These nails should rent that beauty from my cheeks.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>These eyes could not endure that beauty’s wrack;</li>
  <li data-number="130">You should not blemish it, if I stood by:</li>
  <li>As all the world is cheered by the sun,</li>
  <li>So I by that; it is my day, my life.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANNE.">
  <li>Black night o’ershade thy day, and death thy life!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>Curse not thyself, fair creature—thou art both.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANNE.">
  <li data-number="135">I would I were, to be reveng’d on thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>It is a quarrel most unnatural,</li>
  <li>To be reveng’d on him that loveth thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANNE.">
  <li>It is a quarrel just and reasonable,</li>
  <li>To be reveng’d on him that kill’d my husband.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li data-number="140">He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband,</li>
  <li>Did it to help thee to a better husband.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANNE.">
  <li>His better doth not breathe upon the earth.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>He lives, that loves thee better than he could.</li>

<ol data-speaker="ANNE.">
  <li>Name him.</li>

  <li data-offset="3">Plantagenet.</li>

<ol data-speaker="ANNE.">
  <li data-offset="6">Why, that was he.</li>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>The self-same name, but one of better nature.</li>

  <li>Why looks your Grace so heavily today?</li>

<ol data-speaker="CLAR.">
  <li>O, I have pass’d a miserable night,</li>
  <li>So full of fearful dreams, of ugly sights,</li>
  <li>That, as I am a Christian faithful man,</li>
  <li data-number="5">I would not spend another such a night</li>
  <li>Though ’twere to buy a world of happy days—</li>
  <li>So full of dismal terror was the time.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KEEP.">
  <li>What was your dream, my lord? I pray you tell me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAR.">
  <li>Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower</li>
  <li data-number="10">And was embark’d to cross to Burgundy,</li>
  <li>And in my company my brother Gloucester,</li>
  <li>Who from my cabin tempted me to walk</li>
  <li>Upon the hatches. Thence we look’d toward England,</li>
  <li>And cited up a thousand heavy times,</li>
  <li data-number="15">During the wars of York and Lancaster,</li>
  <li>That had befall’n us. As we pac’d along</li>
  <li>Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,</li>
  <li>Methought that Gloucester stumbled, and in falling</li>
  <li>Struck me (that thought to stay him) overboard</li>
  <li data-number="20">Into the tumbling billows of the main.</li>
  <li>O Lord, methought what pain it was to drown!</li>
  <li>What dreadful noise of waters in my ears!</li>
  <li>What sights of ugly death within my eyes!</li>
  <li>Methoughts I saw a thousand fearful wracks;</li>
  <li data-number="25">A thousand men that fishes gnaw’d upon;</li>
  <li>Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,</li>
  <li>Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,</li>
  <li>All scatt’red in the bottom of the sea:</li>
  <li>Some lay in dead men’s skulls, and in the holes</li>
  <li data-number="30">Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept</li>
  <li>(As ’twere in scorn of eyes) reflecting gems,</li>
  <li>That woo’d the slimy bottom of the deep,</li>
  <li>And mock’d the dead bones that lay scatt’red by.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KEEP.">
  <li>Had you such leisure in the time of death</li>

<ol data-speaker="CLAR.">
  <li>Methought I had, and often did I strive</li>
  <li>To yield the ghost; but still the envious flood</li>
  <li>Stopp’d in my soul, and would not let it forth</li>
  <li>To find the empty, vast, and wand’ring air,</li>
  <li data-number="40">But smother’d it within my panting bulk,</li>
  <li>Who almost burst to belch it in the sea.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KEEP.">
  <li>Awak’d you not in this sore agony?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAR.">
  <li>No, no, my dream was lengthen’d after life.</li>
  <li>O then began the tempest to my soul!</li>
  <li data-number="45">I pass’d (methought) the melancholy flood,</li>
  <li>With that sour ferryman which poets write of,</li>
  <li>Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.</li>
  <li>The first that there did greet my stranger soul</li>
  <li>Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick,</li>
  <li data-number="50">Who spake aloud, “What scourge for perjury</li>
  <li>Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?”</li>
  <li>And so he vanish’d. Then came wand’ring by</li>
  <li>A shadow like an angel, with bright hair</li>
  <li>Dabbled in blood, and he shriek’d out aloud,</li>
  <li data-number="55">“Clarence is come—false, fleeting, perjur’d Clarence,</li>
  <li>That stabb’d me in the field by Tewksbury:</li>
  <li>Seize on him, Furies, take him unto torment!”</li>
  <li>With that (methoughts) a legion of foul fiends</li>
  <li>Environ’d me, and howled in mine ears</li>
  <li data-number="60">Such hideous cries that with the very noise</li>
  <li>I, trembling, wak’d, and for a season after</li>
  <li>Could not believe but that I was in hell,</li>
  <li>Such terrible impression made my dream.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KEEP.">
  <li>No marvel, lord, though it affrighted you;</li>
  <li data-number="65">I am afraid (methinks) to hear you tell it.</li>

  <li>For Edward’s sake, and see how he requites me!</li>
  <li>O God! If my deep pray’rs cannot appease thee,</li>
  <li data-number="70">But thou wilt be aveng’d on my misdeeds,</li>
  <li>Yet execute thy wrath in me alone!</li>
  <li>O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!</li>
  <li>Keeper, I prithee sit by me awhile.</li>

<ol data-speaker="EDW.">
  <li>Good grandam, tell us, is our father dead?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUCH.">
  <li>No, boy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARG.">
  <li>Why do you weep so oft, and beat your breast,</li>
  <li>And cry, “O Clarence, my unhappy son!”?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EDW.">
  <li data-number="5">Why do you look on us, and shake your head,</li>
  <li>And call us orphans, wretches, castaways,</li>
  <li>If that our noble father were alive?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUCH.">
  <li>My pretty cousins, you mistake me both:</li>
  <li>I do lament the sickness of the King,</li>
  <li data-number="10">As loath to lose him, not your father’s death;</li>
  <li>It were lost sorrow to wail one that’s lost.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EDW.">
  <li>Then you conclude, my grandam, he is dead.</li>
  <li>The King mine uncle is to blame for it.</li>
  <li>God will revenge it, whom I will importune</li>
  <li data-number="15">With earnest prayers all to that effect.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARG.">
  <li>And so will I.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUCH.">
  <li>Peace, children, peace, the King doth love you well.</li>
  <li>Incapable and shallow innocents,</li>
  <li>You cannot guess who caus’d your father’s death.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EDW.">
  <li data-number="20">Grandam, we can; for my good uncle Gloucester</li>
  <li>Told me the King, provok’d to it by the Queen,</li>
  <li>Devis’d impeachments to imprison him;</li>
  <li>And when my uncle told me so, he wept,</li>
  <li>And pitied me, and kindly kiss’d my cheek;</li>
  <li data-number="25">Bade me rely on him as on my father,</li>
  <li>And he would love me dearly as a child.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUCH.">
  <li>Ah! That deceit should steal such gentle shape,</li>
  <li>And with a virtuous visor hide deep vice!</li>
  <li>He is my son—ay, and therein my shame,</li>
  <li data-number="30">Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EDW.">
  <li>Think you my uncle did dissemble, grandam?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUCH.">
  <li>Ay, boy.</li>

  <li>Ah! Who shall hinder me to wail and weep,</li>

  <li>I’ll join with black despair against my soul,</li>
  <li>And to myself become an enemy.</li>

<ol data-speaker="Q. ELIZ.">
  <li>To make an act of tragic violence.</li>
  <li data-number="40">Edward, my lord, thy son, our king, is dead!</li>
  <li>Why grow the branches when the root is gone?</li>
  <li>Why wither not the leaves that want their sap?</li>
  <li>If you will live, lament; if die, be brief,</li>
  <li>That our swift-winged souls may catch the King’s,</li>
  <li data-number="45">Or like obedient subjects follow him</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUCH.">
  <li>Ah, so much interest have I in thy sorrow</li>

  <li>I have bewept a worthy husband’s death,</li>
  <li data-number="50">And liv’d with looking on his images;</li>
  <li>But now two mirrors of his princely semblance</li>
  <li>Are crack’d in pieces by malignant death,</li>
  <li>And I for comfort have but one false glass,</li>
  <li>That grieves me when I see my shame in him.</li>
  <li data-number="55">Thou art a widow; yet thou art a mother,</li>
  <li>And hast the comfort of thy children left;</li>
  <li>But death hath snatch’d my husband from mine arms,</li>
  <li>And pluck’d two crutches from my feeble hands,</li>
  <li>Clarence and Edward. O, what cause have I</li>
  <li data-number="60">(Thine being but a moi’ty of my moan)</li>
  <li>To overgo thy woes and drown thy cries!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EDW.">

  <li>Give me no help in lamentation,</li>
  <li>I am not barren to bring forth complaints.</li>
  <li>All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes,</li>
  <li>That I being govern’d by the watery moon,</li>
  <li data-number="70">May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world!</li>
  <li>Ah for my husband, for my dear Lord Edward!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CHIL.">

  <li>Their woes are parcell’d, mine is general.</li>
  <li>She for an Edward weeps, and so do I;</li>
  <li>I for a Clarence weep, so doth not she;</li>
  <li>These babes for Clarence weep, and so do I;</li>

  <li>Alas! You three on me, threefold distress’d,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DOR.">
  <li>Comfort, dear mother, God is much displeas’d</li>

  <li>In common worldly things ’tis call’d ungrateful</li>

</div>

<ol data-speaker="BUCK.">
  <li>Welcome, sweet Prince, to London, to your chamber.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts’ sovereign,</li>
  <li>The weary way hath made you melancholy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li>No, uncle, but our crosses on the way</li>
  <li data-number="5">Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy.</li>
  <li>I want more uncles here to welcome me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>Sweet Prince, the untainted virtue of your years</li>
  <li>Hath not yet div’d into the world’s deceit;</li>
  <li>Nor more can you distinguish of a man</li>
  <li data-number="10">Than of his outward show, which, God he knows,</li>
  <li>Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart.</li>
  <li>Those uncles which you want were dangerous;</li>
  <li>Your Grace attended to their sug’red words,</li>
  <li>But look’d not on the poison of their hearts.</li>
  <li data-number="15">God keep you from them, and from such false friends!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li>God keep me from false friends!—but they were none.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>My lord, the Mayor of London comes to greet you.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Lord Mayor and his Train.
	
		MAY.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="MAY.">
  <li>God bless your Grace with health and happy days!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li>I thank you, good my lord, and thank you all.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">
	Mayor and Train stand aside.
	
		MAY.
	
</li>
  <li data-number="20">I thought my mother and my brother York</li>
  <li>Would long ere this have met us on the way.</li>
  <li>Fie, what a slug is Hastings, that he comes not</li>
  <li>To tell us whether they will come or no!</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Lord Hastings.
	
		HAST.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="BUCK.">
  <li>And in good time, here comes the sweating lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li data-number="25">Welcome, my lord. What, will our mother come?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAST.">
  <li>On what occasion, God he knows, not I,</li>
  <li>The Queen your mother and your brother York</li>
  <li>Have taken sanctuary. The tender Prince</li>
  <li>Would fain have come with me to meet your Grace,</li>
  <li data-number="30">But by his mother was perforce withheld.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BUCK.">
  <li>Fie, what an indirect and peevish course</li>
  <li>Is this of hers! Lord Cardinal, will your Grace</li>
  <li>Persuade the Queen to send the Duke of York</li>
  <li>Unto his princely brother presently?</li>
  <li data-number="35">If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him,</li>
  <li>And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CARD.">
  <li>My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory</li>
  <li>Can from his mother win the Duke of York,</li>
  <li>Anon expect him here; but if she be obdurate</li>
  <li data-number="40">To mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid</li>
  <li>We should infringe the holy privilege</li>
  <li>Of blessed sanctuary! Not for all this land</li>
  <li>Would I be guilty of so deep a sin.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BUCK.">
  <li>You are too senseless-obstinate, my lord,</li>
  <li data-number="45">Too ceremonious and traditional.</li>
  <li>Weigh it but with the grossness of this age,</li>
  <li>You break not sanctuary in seizing him.</li>
  <li>The benefit thereof is always granted</li>
  <li>To those whose dealings have deserv’d the place</li>
  <li data-number="50">And those who have the wit to claim the place.</li>
  <li>This prince hath neither claim’d it nor deserv’d it,</li>
  <li>And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it.</li>
  <li>Then taking him from thence that is not there,</li>
  <li>You break no privilege nor charter there.</li>
  <li data-number="55">Oft have I heard of sanctuary men,</li>
  <li>But sanctuary children never till now.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CARD.">
  <li>My lord, you shall overrule my mind for once.</li>
  <li>Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAST.">
  <li>I go, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li data-number="60">Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">

</li>
  <li>Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come,</li>
  <li>Where shall we sojourn till our coronation?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>Where it seems best unto your royal self.</li>
  <li>If I may counsel you, some day or two</li>
  <li data-number="65">Your Highness shall repose you at the Tower;</li>
  <li>Then where you please, and shall be thought most fit</li>
  <li>For your best health and recreation.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li>I do not like the Tower, of any place.</li>
  <li>Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BUCK.">
  <li data-number="70">He did, my gracious lord, begin that place,</li>
  <li>Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li>Is it upon record, or else reported</li>
  <li>Successively from age to age, he built it?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BUCK.">
  <li>Upon record, my gracious lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li data-number="75">But say, my lord, it were not regist’red,</li>
  <li>Methinks the truth should live from age to age,</li>
  <li>As ’twere retail’d to all posterity,</li>
  <li>Even to the general all-ending day.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li class="stage-direction">

  <li>So wise so young, they say do never live long.</li>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>I say, without characters fame lives long.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">
	Aside.
	
		GLOU.
	
</li>
  <li>Thus, like the formal Vice, Iniquity,</li>
  <li>I moralize two meanings in one word.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li>That Julius Caesar was a famous man;</li>
  <li data-number="85">With what his valor did enrich his wit,</li>
  <li>His wit set down to make his valor live.</li>
  <li>Death makes no conquest of this conqueror,</li>
  <li>For now he lives in fame though not in life.</li>
  <li>I’ll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BUCK.">
  <li data-number="90">What, my gracious lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li>And if I live until I be a man,</li>
  <li>I’ll win our ancient right in France again,</li>
  <li>Or die a soldier as I liv’d a king.</li>

<ol data-speaker="BUCK.">
  <li data-number="95">Now in good time, here comes the Duke of York.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li>Richard of York, how fares our loving brother?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK.">
  <li>Well, my dread lord—so must I call you now.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li>Ay, brother, to our grief, as it is yours.</li>
  <li>Too late he died that might have kept that title,</li>
  <li data-number="100">Which by his death hath lost much majesty.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK.">
  <li>I thank you, gentle uncle. O my lord,</li>
  <li>You said that idle weeds are fast in growth:</li>
  <li>The Prince my brother hath outgrown me far.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li data-number="105">He hath, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK.">
  <li>And therefore is he idle?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>O my fair cousin, I must not say so.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK.">
  <li>Then he is more beholding to you than I.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>He may command me as my sovereign,</li>
  <li data-number="110">But you have power in me as in a kinsman.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK.">
  <li>I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>My dagger, little cousin? With all my heart.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li>A beggar, brother?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK.">
  <li>Of my kind uncle, that I know will give,</li>
  <li data-number="115">And being but a toy, which is no grief to give.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>A greater gift than that I’ll give my cousin.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK.">
  <li>A greater gift? O, that’s the sword to it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>Ay, gentle cousin, were it light enough.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK.">
  <li>O then I see you will part but with light gifts!</li>
  <li data-number="120">In weightier things you’ll say a beggar nay.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>It is too heavy for your Grace to wear.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK.">
  <li>I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>What, would you have my weapon, little lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK.">
  <li>I would, that I might thank you as you call me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li data-number="125">How?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK.">
  <li>Little.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li>My Lord of York will still be cross in talk.</li>
  <li>Uncle, your Grace knows how to bear with him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK.">
  <li>You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me.</li>
  <li data-number="130">Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me:</li>
  <li>Because that I am little, like an ape,</li>
  <li>He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders.</li>
</ol>

</li>
  <li>With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!</li>
  <li>To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle,</li>
  <li data-number="135">He prettily and aptly taunts himself:</li>
  <li>So cunning and so young is wonderful.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>My lord, will’t please you pass along?</li>
  <li>Myself and my good cousin Buckingham</li>
  <li>Will to your mother, to entreat of her</li>
  <li data-number="140">To meet you at the Tower and welcome you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK.">
  <li>What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li>My Lord Protector needs will have it so.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK.">
  <li>I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>Why, what should you fear?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK.">
  <li data-number="145">Marry, my uncle Clarence’ angry ghost.</li>
  <li>My grandam told me he was murd’red there.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li>I fear no uncles dead.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>Nor none that live, I hope.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li>And if they live, I hope I need not feat.</li>
  <li data-number="150">But come, my lord; with a heavy heart,</li>
  <li>Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower.</li>

<ol data-speaker="BUCK.">
  <li data-number="5">I did, with his contract with Lady Lucy,</li>
  <li>And his contract by deputy in France,</li>
  <li>Th’ unsatiate greediness of his desire,</li>
  <li>And his enforcement of the city wives,</li>
  <li>His tyranny for trifles, his own bastardy,</li>
  <li data-number="10">As being got, your father then in France,</li>
  <li>And his resemblance, being not like the Duke.</li>
  <li>Withal I did infer your lineaments,</li>
  <li>Being the right idea of your father,</li>
  <li>Both in your form and nobleness of mind;</li>
  <li data-number="15">Laid open all your victories in Scotland,</li>
  <li>Your discipline in war, wisdom in peace,</li>
  <li>Your bounty, virtue, fair humility;</li>
  <li>Indeed, left nothing fitting for your purpose</li>

  <li data-number="20">And when mine oratory drew to an end,</li>
  <li>I bid them that did love their country’s good</li>
  <li>Cry, “God save Richard, England’s royal king!”</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>And did they so?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BUCK.">
  <li>No, so God help me, they spake not a word,</li>
  <li data-number="25">But like dumb statues, or breathing stones,</li>
  <li>Star’d each on other, and look’d deadly pale;</li>
  <li>Which when I saw, I reprehended them,</li>
  <li>And ask’d the Mayor what meant this willful silence.</li>
  <li>His answer was, the people were not used</li>
  <li data-number="30">To be spoke to but by the Recorder.</li>
  <li>Then he was urg’d to tell my tale again:</li>
  <li>“Thus saith the Duke, thus hath the Duke inferr’d”—</li>
  <li>But nothing spake in warrant from himself.</li>
  <li>When he had done, some followers of mine own,</li>
  <li data-number="35">At lower end of the hall, hurl’d up their caps,</li>
  <li>And some ten voices cried, “God save King Richard!”</li>
  <li>And thus I took the vantage of those few:</li>
  <li>“Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,” quoth I,</li>
  <li>“This general applause and cheerful shout</li>
  <li data-number="40">Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard”—</li>

  <li data-number="120">The sceptred office of your ancestors,</li>
  <li>Your state of fortune, and your due of birth,</li>

  <li>Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded</li>
  <li>To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,</li>
  <li>Which fondly you would here impose on me.</li>
  <li>If to reprove you for this suit of yours,</li>
  <li data-number="150">So season’d with your faithful love to me,</li>
  <li>Then on the other side, I check’d my friends.</li>
  <li>Therefore—to speak, and to avoid the first,</li>
  <li>And then, in speaking, not to incur the last—</li>
  <li>Definitively thus I answer you:</li>
  <li data-number="155">Your love deserves my thanks, but my desert</li>
  <li>Unmeritable shuns your high request.</li>
  <li>First, if all obstacles were cut away,</li>
  <li>And that my path were even to the crown,</li>
  <li>As the ripe revenue and due of birth,</li>
  <li data-number="160">Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,</li>
  <li>So mighty and so many my defects,</li>
  <li>That I would rather hide me from my greatness—</li>
  <li>Being a bark to brook no mighty sea—</li>
  <li>Than in my greatness covet to be hid</li>
  <li data-number="165">And in the vapor of my glory smother’d.</li>
  <li>But God be thank’d, there is no need of me,</li>
  <li>And much I need to help you, were there need:</li>
  <li>The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,</li>
  <li>Which mellow’d by the stealing hours of time,</li>
  <li data-number="170">Will well become the seat of majesty,</li>
  <li>And make (no doubt) us happy by his reign.</li>
  <li>On him I lay that you would lay on me,</li>
  <li>The right and fortune of his happy stars,</li>
  <li>Which God defend that I should wring from him!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BUCK.">
  <li data-number="175">My lord, this argues conscience in your Grace,</li>
  <li>But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,</li>
  <li>All circumstances well considered.</li>
  <li>You say that Edward is your brother’s son:</li>
  <li>So say we too, but not by Edward’s wife;</li>
  <li data-number="180">For first was he contract to Lady Lucy—</li>
  <li>Your mother lives a witness to his vow—</li>
  <li>And afterward by substitute betroth’d</li>
  <li>To Bona, sister to the King of France.</li>
  <li>These both put off, a poor petitioner,</li>
  <li data-number="185">A care-craz’d mother to a many sons,</li>
  <li>A beauty-waning and distressed widow,</li>
  <li>Even in the afternoon of her best days,</li>
  <li>Made prize and purchase of his wanton eye,</li>
  <li>Seduc’d the pitch and height of his degree</li>
  <li data-number="190">To base declension and loath’d bigamy.</li>
  <li>By her, in his unlawful bed, he got</li>
  <li>This Edward, whom our manners call the Prince.</li>
  <li>More bitterly could I expostulate,</li>
  <li>Save that for reverence to some alive,</li>
  <li data-number="195">I give a sparing limit to my tongue.</li>
  <li>Then, good my lord, take to your royal self</li>
  <li>This proffer’d benefit of dignity;</li>
  <li>If not to bless us and the land withal,</li>
  <li>Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry</li>

  <li>Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again,</li>
  <li>Within so small a time, my woman’s heart</li>

  <li>Richard except, those whom we fight against</li>

  <li>For what is he they follow? Truly, gentlemen,</li>
  <li>A bloody tyrant and a homicide;</li>

  <li>One that made means to come by what he hath,</li>
  <li data-number="250">And slaughtered those that were the means to help him;</li>
  <li>A base foul stone, made precious by the foil</li>
  <li>Of England’s chair, where he is falsely set;</li>
  <li>One that hath ever been God’s enemy.</li>
  <li>Then if you fight against God’s enemy,</li>
  <li data-number="255">God will in justice ward you as his soldiers;</li>
  <li>If you do sweat to put a tyrant down,</li>

  <li data-number="265">Advance your standards, draw your willing swords.</li>
  <li>For me, the ransom of my bold attempt</li>
  <li>Shall be this cold corpse on the earth’s cold face;</li>
