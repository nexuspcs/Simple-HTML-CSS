<h3>Scene 1</h3>

<h4>A hall in Duke Solinus’s Palace.</h4>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter the Duke of Ephesus with Egeon the merchant of Syracuse, Jailer with Officers, and other Attendants.

<ol data-speaker="EGE.">
  <li>Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall,</li>
  <li>And by the doom of death end woes and all.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li>Merchant of Syracuse, plead no more.</li>
  <li>I am not partial to infringe our laws;</li>
  <li data-number="5">The enmity and discord which of late</li>
  <li>Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your Duke</li>
  <li>To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,</li>
  <li>Who, wanting guilders to redeem their lives,</li>
  <li>Have seal’d his rigorous statutes with their bloods,</li>
  <li data-number="10">Excludes all pity from our threat’ning looks:</li>
  <li>For since the mortal and intestine jars</li>
  <li>’Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,</li>
  <li>It hath in solemn synods been decreed,</li>
  <li>Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,</li>
  <li data-number="15">To admit no traffic to our adverse towns:</li>
  <li>Nay more, if any born at Ephesus be seen</li>
  <li>At any Syracusian marts and fairs;</li>
  <li>Again, if any Syracusian born</li>
  <li>Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies,</li>
  <li data-number="20">His goods confiscate to the Duke’s dispose,</li>
  <li>Unless a thousand marks be levied</li>
  <li>To quit the penalty and to ransom him.</li>
  <li>Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,</li>
  <li>Cannot amount unto a hundred marks,</li>
  <li data-number="25">Therefore by law thou art condemn’d to die.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EGE.">
  <li>Yet this my comfort, when your words are done,</li>
  <li>My woes end likewise with the evening sun.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li>Well, Syracusian; say in brief the cause</li>
  <li>Why thou departedst from thy native home,</li>
  <li data-number="30">And for what cause thou cam’st to Ephesus.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EGE.">
  <li>A heavier task could not have been impos’d</li>
  <li>Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable:</li>
  <li>Yet that the world may witness that my end</li>
  <li>Was wrought by nature, not by vile offense,</li>
  <li data-number="35">I’ll utter what my sorrow gives me leave.</li>
  <li>In Syracuse was I born, and wed</li>
  <li>Unto a woman, happy but for me,</li>
  <li>And by me, had not our hap been bad:</li>
  <li>With her I liv’d in joy; our wealth increas’d</li>
  <li data-number="40">By prosperous voyages I often made</li>
  <li>To Epidamium, till my factor’s death,</li>
  <li>And the great care of goods at random left,</li>
  <li>Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse;</li>
  <li>From whom my absence was not six months old</li>
  <li data-number="45">Before herself (almost at fainting under</li>
  <li>The pleasing punishment that women bear)</li>
  <li>Had made provision for her following me,</li>
  <li>And soon, and safe, arrived where I was.</li>
  <li>There had she not been long but she became</li>
  <li data-number="50">A joyful mother of two goodly sons:</li>
  <li>And, which was strange, the one so like the other</li>
  <li>As could not be distinguish’d but by names.</li>
  <li>That very hour, and in the self-same inn,</li>
  <li>A mean woman was delivered</li>
  <li data-number="55">Of such a burden male, twins both alike.</li>
  <li>Those, for their parents were exceeding poor,</li>
  <li>I bought, and brought up to attend my sons.</li>
  <li>My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,</li>
  <li>Made daily motions for our home return:</li>
  <li data-number="60">Unwilling I agreed. Alas! Too soon</li>
  <li>We came aboard.</li>
  <li>A league from Epidamium had we sail’d</li>
  <li>Before the always-wind-obeying deep</li>
  <li>Gave any tragic instance of our harm:</li>
  <li data-number="65">But longer did we not retain much hope;</li>
  <li>For what obscured light the heavens did grant</li>
  <li>Did but convey unto our fearful minds</li>
  <li>A doubtful warrant of immediate death,</li>
  <li>Which though myself would gladly have embrac’d,</li>
  <li data-number="70">Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,</li>
  <li>Weeping before for what she saw must come,</li>
  <li>And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,</li>
  <li>That mourn’d for fashion, ignorant what to fear,</li>
  <li>Forc’d me to seek delays for them and me.</li>
  <li data-number="75">And this it was (for other means was none):</li>
  <li>The sailors sought for safety by our boat,</li>
  <li>And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us.</li>
  <li>My wife, more careful for the latter-born,</li>
  <li>Had fast’ned him unto a small spare mast,</li>
  <li data-number="80">Such as sea-faring men provide for storms;</li>
  <li>To him one of the other twins was bound,</li>
  <li>Whilst I had been like heedful of the other.</li>
  <li>The children thus dispos’d, my wife and I,</li>
  <li>Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix’d,</li>
  <li data-number="85">Fast’ned ourselves at either end the mast,</li>
  <li>And floating straight, obedient to the stream,</li>
  <li>Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.</li>
  <li>At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,</li>
  <li>Dispers’d those vapors that offended us,</li>
  <li data-number="90">And by the benefit of his wished light</li>
  <li>The seas wax’d calm, and we discovered</li>
  <li>Two ships from far, making amain to us,</li>
  <li>Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this.</li>
  <li>But ere they came—O, let me say no more!</li>
  <li data-number="95">Gather the sequel by that went before.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li>Nay, forward, old man, do not break off so,</li>
  <li>For we may pity, though not pardon thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EGE.">
  <li>O, had the gods done so, I had not now</li>
  <li>Worthily term’d them merciless to us!</li>
  <li data-number="100">For ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,</li>
  <li>We were encount’red by a mighty rock,</li>
  <li>Which being violently borne upon,</li>
  <li>Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;</li>
  <li>So that, in this unjust divorce of us,</li>
  <li data-number="105">Fortune had left to both of us alike</li>
  <li>What to delight in, what to sorrow for.</li>
  <li>Her part, poor soul! Seeming as burdened</li>
  <li>With lesser weight, but not with lesser woe,</li>
  <li>Was carried with more speed before the wind,</li>
  <li data-number="110">And in our sight they three were taken up</li>
  <li>By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.</li>
  <li>At length, another ship had seiz’d on us,</li>
  <li>And knowing whom it was their hap to save,</li>
  <li>Gave healthful welcome to their shipwrack’d guests,</li>
  <li data-number="115">And would have reft the fishers of their prey,</li>
  <li>Had not their bark been very slow of sail;</li>
  <li>And therefore homeward did they bend their course.</li>
  <li>Thus have you heard me sever’d from my bliss,</li>
  <li>That by misfortunes was my life prolong’d,</li>
  <li data-number="120">To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li>And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,</li>
  <li>Do me the favor to dilate at full</li>
  <li>What have befall’n of them and thee till now.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EGE.">
  <li>My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,</li>
  <li data-number="125">At eighteen years became inquisitive</li>
  <li>After his brother; and importun’d me</li>
  <li>That his attendant—so his case was like,</li>
  <li>Reft of his brother, but retain’d his name—</li>
  <li>Might bear him company in the quest of him:</li>
  <li data-number="130">Whom whilst I labored of a love to see,</li>
  <li>I hazarded the loss of whom I lov’d.</li>
  <li>Five summers have I spent in farthest Greece,</li>
  <li>Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,</li>
  <li>And coasting homeward, came to Ephesus;</li>
  <li data-number="135">Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought</li>
  <li>Or that, or any place that harbors men.</li>
  <li>But here must end the story of my life,</li>
  <li>And happy were I in my timely death,</li>
  <li>Could all my travels warrant me they live.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li data-number="140">Hapless Egeon, whom the fates have mark’d</li>
  <li>To bear the extremity of dire mishap!</li>
  <li>Now trust me, were it not against our laws,</li>
  <li>Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,</li>
  <li>Which princes, would they, may not disannul,</li>
  <li data-number="145">My soul should sue as advocate for thee:</li>
  <li>But though thou art adjudged to the death,</li>
  <li>And passed sentence may not be recall’d</li>
  <li>But to our honor’s great disparagement,</li>
  <li>Yet will I favor thee in what I can;</li>
  <li data-number="150">Therefore, merchant, I’ll limit thee this day</li>
  <li>To seek thy health by beneficial help.</li>
  <li>Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;</li>
  <li>Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,</li>
  <li>And live: if no, then thou art doom’d to die.</li>
  <li data-number="155">Jailer, take him to thy custody.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JAIL.">
  <li>I will, my lord.</li>

<ol data-speaker="1. MER.">
  <li>Therefore give out you are of Epidamium,</li>
  <li>Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate:</li>
  <li>This very day a Syracusian merchant</li>
  <li>Is apprehended for arrival here;</li>
  <li data-number="5">And not being able to buy out his life,</li>
  <li>According to the statute of the town,</li>
  <li>Dies ere the weary sun set in the west.</li>
  <li>There is your money that I had to keep.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li>Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host,</li>
  <li data-number="10">And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee.</li>
  <li>Within this hour it will be dinner-time;</li>
  <li>Till that, I’ll view the manners of the town,</li>
  <li>Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings,</li>
  <li>And then return and sleep within mine inn,</li>
  <li data-number="15">For with long travel I am stiff and weary.</li>
  <li>Get thee away.</li>

  <li>Lightens my humor with his merry jests.</li>
  <li>What, will you walk with me about the town,</li>

<ol data-speaker="1. MER.">
  <li>I am invited, sir, to certain merchants,</li>

  <li>I crave your pardon. Soon at five a’ clock,</li>
  <li>Please you, I’ll meet with you upon the mart,</li>

</li>
  <li>Here comes the almanac of my true date.</li>
  <li>What now? How chance thou art return’d so soon?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="E. DRO.">
  <li>Return’d so soon! Rather approach’d too late:</li>
  <li>The capon burns, the pig falls from the spit;</li>
  <li data-number="45">The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell:</li>
  <li>My mistress made it one upon my cheek:</li>
  <li>She is so hot, because the meat is cold:</li>
  <li>The meat is cold, because you come not home:</li>
  <li>You come not home, because you have no stomach:</li>
  <li data-number="50">You have no stomach, having broke your fast:</li>
  <li>But we that know what ’tis to fast and pray,</li>
  <li>Are penitent for your default today.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li>Stop in your wind, sir; tell me this, I pray:</li>
  <li>Where have you left the money that I gave you?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="E. DRO.">
  <li data-number="55">O—sixpence that I had a’ We’n’sday last</li>
  <li>To pay the saddler for my mistress’ crupper?</li>
  <li>The saddler had it, sir, I kept it not.</li>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li>I am not in a sportive humor now:</li>
  <li>Tell me, and dally not, where is the money?</li>
  <li data-number="60">We being strangers here, how dar’st thou trust</li>
  <li>So great a charge from thine own custody?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="E. DRO.">
  <li>I pray you jest, sir, as you sit at dinner.</li>
  <li>I from my mistress come to you in post:</li>
  <li>If I return, I shall be post indeed,</li>
  <li data-number="65">For she will score your fault upon my pate:</li>
  <li>Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock,</li>
  <li>And strike you home without a messenger.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li>Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season,</li>
  <li>Reserve them till a merrier hour than this:</li>
  <li data-number="70">Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="E. DRO.">
  <li>To me, sir? Why, you gave no gold to me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li>Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness,</li>
  <li>And tell me how thou hast dispos’d thy charge.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="E. DRO.">
  <li>My charge was but to fetch you from the mart</li>
  <li data-number="75">Home to your house, the Phoenix, sir, to dinner;</li>
  <li>My mistress and her sister stays for you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li>Now, as I am a Christian, answer me,</li>
  <li>In what safe place you have bestow’d my money;</li>
  <li>Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours</li>
  <li data-number="80">That stands on tricks when I am undispos’d:</li>
  <li>Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="E. DRO.">
  <li>I have some marks of yours upon my pate;</li>
  <li>Some of my mistress’ marks upon my shoulders;</li>
  <li>But not a thousand marks between you both.</li>
  <li data-number="85">If I should pay your worship those again,</li>
  <li>Perchance you will not bear them patiently.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li>Thy mistress’ marks? What mistress, slave, hast thou?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="E. DRO.">
  <li>Your worship’s wife, my mistress at the Phoenix;</li>
  <li>She that doth fast till you come home to dinner;</li>
  <li data-number="90">And prays that you will hie you home to dinner.</li>

  <li>Neither my husband nor the slave return’d,</li>

  <li>Sure, Luciana, it is two a’ clock.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li>Perhaps some merchant hath invited him,</li>

  <li>Good sister, let us dine, and never fret;</li>
  <li>A man is master of his liberty:</li>
  <li>Time is their master, and when they see time,</li>
  <li>They’ll go or come; if so, be patient, sister.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ADR.">
  <li data-number="10">Why should their liberty than ours be more?</li>

  <li data-number="15">Why, headstrong liberty is lash’d with woe:</li>
  <li>There’s nothing situate under heaven’s eye</li>
  <li>But hath his bound in earth, in sea, in sky.</li>
  <li>The beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls</li>

  <li>But, were you wedded, you would bear some sway.</li>

  <li>Ere I learn love, I’ll practice to obey.</li>

  <li>The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up</li>

  <li>By computation and mine host’s report,</li>
  <li data-number="5">I could not speak with Dromio since at first</li>
  <li>I sent him from the mart! See, here he comes.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">
	Enter Dromio of Syracuse.
	
		S. ANT.
	
</li>
  <li>How now, sir, is your merry humor alter’d?</li>
  <li>As you love strokes, so jest with me again.</li>
  <li>You know no Centaur? You receiv’d no gold?</li>
  <li data-number="10">Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner?</li>
  <li>My house was at the Phoenix? Wast thou mad,</li>
  <li>That thus so madly thou didst answer me?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. DRO.">
  <li>What answer, sir? When spake I such a word?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li>Even now, even here, not half an hour since.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. DRO.">
  <li data-number="15">I did not see you since you sent me hence</li>
  <li>Home to the Centaur with the gold you gave me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li>Villain, thou didst deny the gold’s receipt,</li>
  <li>And toldst me of a mistress, and a dinner,</li>
  <li>For which I hope thou feltst I was displeas’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. DRO.">
  <li data-number="20">I am glad to see you in this merry vein.</li>
  <li>What means this jest? I pray you, master, tell me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li>Yea, dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth?</li>
  <li>Think’st thou I jest? Hold, take thou that, and that.</li>

</div>

<ol data-speaker="S. DRO.">
  <li>Hold, sir, for God’s sake! Now your jest is earnest,</li>
  <li data-number="25">Upon what bargain do you give it me?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li>Because that I familiarly sometimes</li>
  <li>Do use you for my fool, and chat with you,</li>
  <li>Your sauciness will jest upon my love,</li>
  <li>And make a common of my serious hours.</li>
  <li data-number="30">When the sun shines, let foolish gnats make sport,</li>
  <li>But creep in crannies, when he hides his beams:</li>
  <li>If you will jest with me, know my aspect,</li>
  <li>And fashion your demeanor to my looks,</li>
  <li>Or I will beat this method in your sconce.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. DRO.">
  <li data-number="35">Sconce call you it? So you would leave battering, I had rather have it a head. And you use these blows long, I must get a sconce for my head, and ensconce it too, or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders. But I pray, sir, why am I beaten?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li>Dost thou not know?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. DRO.">
  <li>Nothing, sir, but that I am beaten.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li>Shall I tell you why?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. DRO.">
  <li>Ay, sir, and wherefore; for they say, every why hath a wherefore.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li data-number="40">Why first—for flouting me, and then wherefore—</li>
  <li>For urging it the second time to me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. DRO.">
  <li>Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season,</li>
  <li>When in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme nor reason?</li>
  <li>Well, sir, I thank you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li data-number="45">Thank me, sir, for what?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. DRO.">
  <li>Marry, sir, for this something that you gave me for nothing.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li>I’ll make you amends next, to give you nothing for something. But say, sir, is it dinner-time?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. DRO.">
  <li>No, sir, I think the meat wants that I have.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li>In good time, sir: what’s that?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. DRO.">
  <li data-number="50">Basting.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li>Well, sir, then ’twill be dry.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. DRO.">
  <li>If it be, sir, I pray you eat none of it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li>Your reason?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. DRO.">
  <li>Lest it make you choleric, and purchase me another dry basting.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li data-number="55">Well, sir, learn to jest in good time—there’s a time for all things.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. DRO.">
  <li>I durst have denied that before you were so choleric.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li>By what rule, sir?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. DRO.">
  <li>Marry, sir, by a rule as plain as the plain bald pate of Father Time himself.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li>Let’s hear it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. DRO.">
  <li data-number="60">There’s no time for a man to recover his hair that grows bald by nature.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li>May he not do it by fine and recovery?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. DRO.">
  <li>Yes, to pay a fine for a periwig, and recover the lost hair of another man.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li>Why is Time such a niggard of hair, being (as it is) so plentiful an excrement?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. DRO.">
  <li>Because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts, and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li data-number="65">Why, but there’s many a man hath more hair than wit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. DRO.">
  <li>Not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li>Why, thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. DRO.">
  <li>The plainer dealer, the sooner lost; yet he loseth it in a kind of jollity.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li>For what reason?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. DRO.">
  <li data-number="70">For two—and sound ones too.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li>Nay, not sound, I pray you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. DRO.">
  <li>Sure ones then.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li>Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. DRO.">
  <li>Certain ones then.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li data-number="75">Name them.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. DRO.">
  <li>The one, to save the money that he spends in tiring; the other, that at dinner they should not drop in his porridge.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li>You would all this time have prov’d there is no time for all things.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. DRO.">
  <li>Marry, and did, sir: namely, e’en no time to recover hair lost by nature.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li>But your reason was not substantial, why there is no time to recover.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. DRO.">
  <li data-number="80">Thus I mend it: Time himself is bald, and therefore, to the world’s end, will have bald followers.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li>I knew ’twould be a bald conclusion. But soft, who wafts us yonder?</li>

  <li>Wouldst thou not spit at me, and spurn at me,</li>

  <li>And tear the stain’d skin off my harlot brow,</li>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li>And may it be that you have quite forgot</li>
  <li>A husband’s office? Shall, Antipholus,</li>
  <li>Even in the spring of love, thy love-springs rot?</li>
  <li>Shall love, in building, grow so ruinous?</li>
  <li data-number="5">If you did wed my sister for her wealth,</li>
  <li>Then for her wealth’s sake use her with more kindness:</li>
  <li>Or if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth,</li>
  <li>Muffle your false love with some show of blindness:</li>
  <li>Let not my sister read it in your eye;</li>
  <li data-number="10">Be not thy tongue thy own shame’s orator:</li>
  <li>Look sweet, speak fair, become disloyalty;</li>
  <li>Apparel vice like virtue’s harbinger;</li>
  <li>Bear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted;</li>
  <li>Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint;</li>
  <li data-number="15">Be secret-false: what need she be acquainted?</li>
  <li>What simple thief brags of his own attaint?</li>
  <li>’Tis double wrong, to truant with your bed,</li>
  <li>And let her read it in thy looks at board:</li>
  <li>Shame hath a bastard fame, well managed;</li>
  <li data-number="20">Ill deeds is doubled with an evil word.</li>
  <li>Alas, poor women, make us but believe</li>
  <li>(Being compact of credit) that you love us;</li>
  <li>Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve:</li>
  <li>We in your motion turn, and you may move us.</li>
  <li data-number="25">Then, gentle brother, get you in again;</li>
  <li>Comfort my sister, cheer her, call her wife:</li>
  <li>’Tis holy sport to be a little vain,</li>
  <li>When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li>Sweet mistress—what your name is else, I know not,</li>
  <li data-number="30">Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine—</li>
  <li>Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not</li>
  <li>Than our earth’s wonder, more than earth divine.</li>
  <li>Teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak:</li>
  <li>Lay open to my earthy gross conceit,</li>
  <li data-number="35">Smoth’red in errors, feeble, shallow, weak,</li>
  <li>The folded meaning of your words’ deceit.</li>
  <li>Against my soul’s pure truth why labor you,</li>
  <li>To make it wander in an unknown field?</li>
  <li>Are you a god? Would you create me new?</li>
  <li data-number="40">Transform me then, and to your pow’r I’ll yield.</li>
  <li>But if that I am I, then well I know</li>
  <li>Your weeping sister is no wife of mine,</li>
  <li>Nor to her bed no homage do I owe:</li>
  <li>Far more, far more, to you do I decline.</li>
  <li data-number="45">O, train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note,</li>
  <li>To drown me in thy sister’s flood of tears.</li>
  <li>Sing, siren, for thyself, and I will dote;</li>
  <li>Spread o’er the silver waves thy golden hairs,</li>
  <li>And as a bed I’ll take them, and there lie,</li>
  <li data-number="50">And in that glorious supposition think</li>
  <li>He gains by death that hath such means to die:</li>
  <li>Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink!</li>

<ol data-speaker="S. DRO.">
  <li>O, sir, I did not look so low.

  <li data-number="105">And I think, if my breast had not been made of faith, and my heart of steel,</li>
  <li>She had transform’d me to a curtal dog, and made me turn i’ th’ wheel.</li>
