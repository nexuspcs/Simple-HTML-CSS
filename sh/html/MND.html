<h3>Scene 1</h3>

<h4>Athens. A room in the palace of Theseus.</h4>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, Philostrate, with others.
	
		THE.
		HIP.

</div>

<ol data-speaker="THE.">
  <li>Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour</li>
  <li>Draws on apace. Four happy days bring in</li>
  <li>Another moon; but O, methinks, how slow</li>
  <li>This old moon wanes! She lingers my desires,</li>
  <li data-number="5">Like to a step-dame, or a dowager,</li>
  <li>Long withering out a young man’s revenue.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HIP.">
  <li>Four days will quickly steep themselves in night;</li>
  <li>Four nights will quickly dream away the time;</li>
  <li>And then the moon, like to a silver bow</li>
  <li>New bent in heaven, shall behold the night</li>
  <li>Of our solemnities.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="THE.">
  <li data-offset="4">Go, Philostrate,</li>
  <li>Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments,</li>
  <li>Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth,</li>
  <li>Turn melancholy forth to funerals:</li>
  <li data-number="15">The pale companion is not for our pomp.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">
	Exit Philostrate.
	
		PHIL.
	
</li>
  <li>Hippolyta, I woo’d thee with my sword,</li>
  <li>And won thy love doing thee injuries;</li>
  <li>But I will wed thee in another key,</li>
  <li>With pomp, with triumph, and with reveling.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Egeus and his daughter Hermia and Lysander and Demetrius.

</div>

<ol data-speaker="EGE.">
  <li data-number="20">Happy be Theseus, our renowned Duke!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="THE.">
  <li>Thanks, good Egeus. What’s the news with thee?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EGE.">
  <li>Full of vexation come I, with complaint</li>
  <li>Against my child, my daughter Hermia.</li>
  <li>Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord,</li>
  <li data-number="25">This man hath my consent to marry her.</li>
  <li>Stand forth, Lysander. And, my gracious Duke,</li>
  <li>This man hath bewitch’d the bosom of my child.</li>
  <li>Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,</li>
  <li>And interchang’d love-tokens with my child;</li>
  <li data-number="30">Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung</li>
  <li>With faining voice verses of faining love,</li>
  <li>And stol’n the impression of her fantasy</li>
  <li>With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits,</li>
  <li>Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats—messengers</li>
  <li data-number="35">Of strong prevailment in unhardened youth.</li>
  <li>With cunning hast thou filch’d my daughter’s heart,</li>
  <li>Turn’d her obedience (which is due to me)</li>
  <li>To stubborn harshness. And, my gracious Duke,</li>
  <li>Be it so she will not here before your Grace</li>
  <li data-number="40">Consent to marry with Demetrius,</li>
  <li>I beg the ancient privilege of Athens:</li>
  <li>As she is mine, I may dispose of her;</li>
  <li>Which shall be either to this gentleman,</li>
  <li>Or to her death, according to our law</li>
  <li data-number="45">Immediately provided in that case.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="THE.">
  <li>What say you, Hermia? Be advis’d, fair maid.</li>
  <li>To you your father should be as a god;</li>
  <li>One that compos’d your beauties; yea, and one</li>
  <li>To whom you are but as a form in wax,</li>
  <li data-number="50">By him imprinted, and within his power,</li>
  <li>To leave the figure, or disfigure it.</li>
  <li>Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HER.">
  <li>So is Lysander.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="THE.">
  <li data-offset="3">In himself he is;</li>
  <li>But in this kind, wanting your father’s voice,</li>
  <li data-number="55">The other must be held the worthier.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HER.">
  <li>I would my father look’d but with my eyes.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="THE.">
  <li>Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HER.">
  <li>I do entreat your Grace to pardon me.</li>
  <li>I know not by what power I am made bold,</li>
  <li data-number="60">Nor how it may concern my modesty,</li>
  <li>In such a presence here to plead my thoughts;</li>
  <li>But I beseech your Grace that I may know</li>
  <li>The worst that may befall me in this case,</li>
  <li>If I refuse to wed Demetrius.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="THE.">
  <li data-number="65">Either to die the death, or to abjure</li>
  <li>Forever the society of men.</li>
  <li>Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires,</li>
  <li>Know of your youth, examine well your blood,</li>
  <li>Whether (if you yield not to your father’s choice)</li>
  <li data-number="70">You can endure the livery of a nun,</li>
  <li>For aye to be in shady cloister mew’d,</li>
  <li>To live a barren sister all your life,</li>
  <li>Chaunting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.</li>
  <li>Thrice blessed they that master so their blood</li>
  <li data-number="75">To undergo such maiden pilgrimage;</li>
  <li>But earthlier happy is the rose distill’d,</li>
  <li>Than that which withering on the virgin thorn</li>
  <li>Grows, lives, and dies in single blessedness.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HER.">
  <li>So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,</li>
  <li data-number="80">Ere I will yield my virgin patent up</li>
  <li>Unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke</li>
  <li>My soul consents not to give sovereignty.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="THE.">
  <li>Take time to pause, and by the next new moon—</li>
  <li>The sealing-day betwixt my love and me</li>
  <li data-number="85">For everlasting bond of fellowship—</li>
  <li>Upon that day either prepare to die</li>
  <li>For disobedience to your father’s will,</li>
  <li>Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would,</li>
  <li>Or on Diana’s altar to protest</li>
  <li data-number="90">For aye austerity and single life.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DEM.">
  <li>Relent, sweet Hermia, and, Lysander, yield</li>
  <li>Thy crazed title to my certain right.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LYS.">
  <li>You have her father’s love, Demetrius,</li>
  <li>Let me have Hermia’s; do you marry him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EGE.">
  <li data-number="95">Scornful Lysander, true, he hath my love;</li>
  <li>And what is mine, my love shall render him.</li>
  <li>And she is mine, and all my right of her</li>
  <li>I do estate unto Demetrius.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LYS.">
  <li>I am, my lord, as well deriv’d as he,</li>
  <li data-number="100">As well possess’d; my love is more than his;</li>
  <li>My fortunes every way as fairly rank’d</li>
  <li>(If not with vantage) as Demetrius’;</li>
  <li>And (which is more than all these boasts can be)</li>
  <li>I am belov’d of beauteous Hermia.</li>
  <li data-number="105">Why should not I then prosecute my right?</li>
  <li>Demetrius, I’ll avouch it to his head,</li>
  <li>Made love to Nedar’s daughter, Helena,</li>
  <li>And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,</li>
  <li>Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,</li>
  <li data-number="110">Upon this spotted and inconstant man.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="THE.">
  <li>I must confess that I have heard so much,</li>
  <li>And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;</li>
  <li>But, being over-full of self-affairs,</li>
  <li>My mind did lose it. But, Demetrius, come,</li>
  <li data-number="115">And come, Egeus, you shall go with me;</li>
  <li>I have some private schooling for you both.</li>
  <li>For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself</li>
  <li>To fit your fancies to your father’s will;</li>
  <li>Or else the law of Athens yields you up</li>
  <li data-number="120">(Which by no means we may extenuate)</li>
  <li>To death, or to a vow of single life.</li>
  <li>Come, my Hippolyta; what cheer, my love?</li>
  <li>Demetrius and Egeus, go along;</li>
  <li>I must employ you in some business</li>
  <li data-number="125">Against our nuptial, and confer with you</li>
  <li>Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EGE.">
  <li>With duty and desire we follow you.</li>

<ol data-speaker="LYS.">
  <li>How now, my love? Why is your cheek so pale?</li>
  <li>How chance the roses there do fade so fast?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HER.">
  <li data-number="130">Belike for want of rain; which I could well</li>
  <li>Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LYS.">
  <li>Ay me! For aught that I could ever read,</li>
  <li>Could ever hear by tale or history,</li>
  <li>The course of true love never did run smooth;</li>
  <li data-number="135">But either it was different in blood—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HER.">
  <li>O cross! Too high to be enthrall’d to low.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LYS.">
  <li>Or else misgraffed in respect of years—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HER.">
  <li>O spite! Too old to be engag’d to young.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LYS.">
  <li>Or else it stood upon the choice of friends—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HER.">
  <li data-number="140">O hell, to choose love by another’s eyes!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LYS.">
  <li>Or if there were a sympathy in choice,</li>
  <li>War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,</li>
  <li>Making it momentany as a sound,</li>
  <li>Swift as a shadow, short as any dream,</li>
  <li data-number="145">Brief as the lightning in the collied night,</li>
  <li>That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth;</li>
  <li>And ere a man hath power to say “Behold!”</li>
  <li>The jaws of darkness do devour it up:</li>
  <li>So quick bright things come to confusion.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HER.">
  <li data-number="150">If then true lovers have been ever cross’d,</li>
  <li>It stands as an edict in destiny.</li>
  <li>Then let us teach our trial patience,</li>
  <li>Because it is a customary cross,</li>
  <li>As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,</li>
  <li data-number="155">Wishes and tears, poor fancy’s followers.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LYS.">
  <li>A good persuasion; therefore hear me, Hermia:</li>
  <li>I have a widow aunt, a dowager,</li>
  <li>Of great revenue, and she hath no child.</li>
  <li>From Athens is her house remote seven leagues;</li>
  <li data-number="160">And she respects me as her only son.</li>
  <li>There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee;</li>
  <li>And to that place the sharp Athenian law</li>
  <li>Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me, then</li>
  <li>Steal forth thy father’s house tomorrow night;</li>
  <li data-number="165">And in the wood, a league without the town</li>
  <li>(Where I did meet thee once with Helena</li>
  <li>To do observance to a morn of May),</li>
  <li>There will I stay for thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HER.">
  <li data-offset="5">My good Lysander,</li>
  <li>I swear to thee, by Cupid’s strongest bow,</li>
  <li data-number="170">By his best arrow with the golden head,</li>
  <li>By the simplicity of Venus’ doves,</li>
  <li>By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,</li>
  <li>And by that fire which burn’d the Carthage queen</li>
  <li>When the false Troyan under sail was seen,</li>
  <li data-number="175">By all the vows that ever men have broke</li>
  <li>(In number more than ever women spoke),</li>
  <li>In that same place thou hast appointed me</li>
  <li>Tomorrow truly will I meet with thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LYS.">
  <li>Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Helena.
	
		HEL.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="HER.">
  <li data-number="180">God speed fair Helena! Whither away?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HEL.">
  <li>Call you me fair? That fair again unsay.</li>
  <li>Demetrius loves your fair, O happy fair!</li>
  <li>Your eyes are lodestars, and your tongue’s sweet air</li>
  <li>More tuneable than lark to shepherd’s ear</li>
  <li data-number="185">When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.</li>
  <li>Sickness is catching; O, were favor so,</li>
  <li>Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go;</li>
  <li>My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,</li>
  <li>My tongue should catch your tongue’s sweet melody.</li>
  <li data-number="190">Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,</li>
  <li>The rest I’ll give to be to you translated.</li>
  <li>O, teach me how you look, and with what art</li>
  <li>You sway the motion of Demetrius’ heart.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HER.">
  <li>I frown upon him; yet he loves me still.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HEL.">
  <li data-number="195">O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HER.">
  <li>I give him curses; yet he gives me love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HEL.">
  <li>O that my prayers could such affection move!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HER.">
  <li>The more I hate, the more he follows me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HEL.">
  <li>The more I love, the more he hateth me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HER.">
  <li data-number="200">His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HEL.">
  <li>None but your beauty; would that fault were mine!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HER.">
  <li>Take comfort; he no more shall see my face;</li>
  <li>Lysander and myself will fly this place.</li>
  <li>Before the time I did Lysander see,</li>
  <li data-number="205">Seem’d Athens as a paradise to me;</li>
  <li>O then, what graces in my love do dwell,</li>
  <li>That he hath turn’d a heaven unto a hell!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LYS.">
  <li>Helen, to you our minds we will unfold:</li>
  <li>Tomorrow night, when Phoebe doth behold</li>
  <li data-number="210">Her silver visage in the wat’ry glass,</li>
  <li>Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass</li>
  <li>(A time that lovers’ flights doth still conceal),</li>
  <li>Through Athens gates have we devis’d to steal.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HER.">
  <li>And in the wood, where often you and I</li>
  <li data-number="215">Upon faint primrose beds were wont to lie,</li>
  <li>Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,</li>
  <li>There my Lysander and myself shall meet;</li>
  <li>And thence from Athens turn away our eyes,</li>
  <li>To seek new friends and stranger companies.</li>
  <li data-number="220">Farewell, sweet playfellow, pray thou for us;</li>
  <li>And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!</li>
  <li>Keep word, Lysander; we must starve our sight</li>
  <li>From lovers’ food till morrow deep midnight.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LYS.">
  <li>I will, my Hermia.</li>

<ol data-speaker="HEL.">
  <li>How happy some o’er other some can be!</li>
  <li>Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.</li>
  <li>But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;</li>
  <li>He will not know what all but he do know;</li>
  <li data-number="230">And as he errs, doting on Hermia’s eyes,</li>
  <li>So I, admiring of his qualities.</li>
  <li>Things base and vile, holding no quantity,</li>
  <li>Love can transpose to form and dignity.</li>
  <li>Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind;</li>
  <li data-number="235">And therefore is wing’d Cupid painted blind.</li>
  <li>Nor hath Love’s mind of any judgment taste;</li>
  <li>Wings, and no eyes, figure unheedy haste;</li>
  <li>And therefore is Love said to be a child,</li>
  <li>Because in choice he is so oft beguil’d.</li>
  <li data-number="240">As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,</li>
  <li>So the boy Love is perjur’d every where;</li>
  <li>For ere Demetrius look’d on Hermia’s eyne,</li>
  <li>He hail’d down oaths that he was only mine;</li>
  <li>And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,</li>
  <li data-number="245">So he dissolv’d, and show’rs of oaths did melt.</li>
  <li>I will go tell him of fair Hermia’s flight;</li>
  <li>Then to the wood will he tomorrow night</li>
  <li>Pursue her; and for this intelligence</li>
  <li>If I have thanks, it is a dear expense.</li>
  <li data-number="250">But herein mean I to enrich my pain,</li>
  <li>To have his sight thither and back again.</li>

<h3>Scene 2</h3>

<h4>Athens. A room in Quince’s house.</h4>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Quince the carpenter and Snug the joiner and Bottom the weaver and Flute the bellows-mender and Snout the tinker and Starveling the tailor.
	
		QUIN.

</div>

<ol data-speaker="QUIN.">
  <li>Is all our company here?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOT.">
  <li>You were best to call them generally, man by man, according to the scrip.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUIN.">
  <li>Here is the scroll of every man’s name, which is thought fit, through all Athens, to play in our enterlude before the Duke and the Duchess, on his wedding-day at night.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOT.">
  <li>First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats on; then read the names of the actors; and so grow to a point.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUIN.">
  <li data-number="5">Marry, our play is The most lamentable comedy and most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisbe.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOT.">
  <li>A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a merry. Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your actors by the scroll. Masters, spread yourselves.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUIN.">
  <li>Answer as I call you. Nick Bottom the weaver.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOT.">
  <li>Ready. Name what part I am for, and proceed.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUIN.">
  <li>You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOT.">
  <li data-number="10">What is Pyramus? A lover, or a tyrant?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUIN.">
  <li>A lover, that kills himself most gallant for love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOT.">
  <li>That will ask some tears in the true performing of it. If I do it, let the audience look to their eyes. I will move storms; I will condole in some measure. To the rest—yet my chief humor is for a tyrant. I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to tear a cat in, to make all split.</li>
  <li><recite>“The raging rocks</recite></li>
  <li><recite>And shivering shocks</recite></li>
  <li data-number="15"><recite>Shall break the locks</recite></li>
  <li><recite>Of prison gates;</recite></li>
  <li><recite>And Phibbus’ car</recite></li>
  <li><recite>Shall shine from far,</recite></li>
  <li><recite>And make and mar</recite></li>
  <li data-number="20"><recite>The foolish Fates.”</recite></li>
  <li>This was lofty! Now name the rest of the players. This is Ercles’ vein, a tyrant’s vein; a lover is more condoling.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUIN.">
  <li>Francis Flute the bellows-mender.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FLU.">
  <li>Here, Peter Quince.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUIN.">
  <li>Flute, you must take Thisbe on you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FLU.">
  <li data-number="25">What is Thisbe? A wand’ring knight?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUIN.">
  <li>It is the lady that Pyramus must love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FLU.">
  <li>Nay, faith; let not me play a woman; I have a beard coming.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUIN.">
  <li>That’s all one; you shall play it in a mask, and you may speak as small as you will.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOT.">
  <li>And I may hide my face, let me play Thisbe too. I’ll speak in a monstrous little voice, “Thisne! Thisne! Ah, Pyramus, my lover dear! Thy Thisbe dear, and lady dear!”</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUIN.">
  <li data-number="30">No, no, you must play Pyramus; and, Flute, you Thisbe.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOT.">
  <li>Well, proceed.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUIN.">
  <li>Robin Starveling the tailor.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="STAR.">
  <li>Here, Peter Quince.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUIN.">
  <li>Robin Starveling, you must play Thisbe’s mother. Tom Snout the tinker.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SNOUT.">
  <li data-number="35">Here, Peter Quince.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUIN.">
  <li>You, Pyramus’ father; myself, Thisbe’s father; Snug the joiner, you the lion’s part. And I hope here is a play fitted.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SNUG.">
  <li>Have you the lion’s part written? Pray you, if it be, give it me, for I am slow of study.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUIN.">
  <li>You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOT.">
  <li>Let me play the lion too. I will roar, that I will do any man’s heart good to hear me. I will roar, that I will make the Duke say, “Let him roar again; let him roar again.”</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUIN.">
  <li data-number="40">And you should do it too terribly, you would fright the Duchess and the ladies, that they would shriek; and that were enough to hang us all.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALL.">
  <li>That would hang us, every mother’s son.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOT.">
  <li>I grant you, friends, if you should fright the ladies out of their wits, they would have no more discretion but to hang us; but I will aggravate my voice so that I will roar you as gently as any sucking dove; I will roar you and ’twere any nightingale.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUIN.">
  <li>You can play no part but Pyramus; for Pyramus is a sweet-fac’d man; a proper man as one shall see in a summer’s day; a most lovely gentleman-like man: therefore you must needs play Pyramus.</li>

  <li>Well; I will undertake it. What beard were I best to play it in?</li>

<ol data-speaker="BOT.">
  <li>I will discharge it in either your straw-color beard, your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain beard, or your French-crown-color beard, your perfit yellow.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUIN.">
  <li>Some of your French crowns have no hair at all; and then you will play barefac’d. But, masters, here are your parts, and I am to entreat you, request you, and desire you, to con them by tomorrow night; and meet me in the palace wood, a mile without the town, by moonlight; there will we rehearse; for if we meet in the city, we shall be dogg’d with company, and our devices known. In the meantime I will draw a bill of properties, such as our play wants. I pray you fail me not.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOT.">
  <li>We will meet, and there we may rehearse most obscenely and courageously. Take pains, be perfit; <foreign xml:lang="fr">adieu</foreign>.</li>

<h3>Scene 1</h3>

<h4>In the woods near Athens.</h4>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter a Fairy at one door and Robin Goodfellow (Puck) at another.
	
		FAIRY.
		PUCK.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="PUCK.">
  <li>How now, spirit, whither wander you?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAIRY.">
  <li>Over hill, over dale,</li>
  <li>Thorough bush, thorough brier,</li>
  <li>Over park, over pale,</li>
  <li data-number="5">Thorough flood, thorough fire,</li>
  <li>I do wander every where,</li>
  <li>Swifter than the moon’s sphere;</li>
  <li>And I serve the Fairy Queen,</li>
  <li>To dew her orbs upon the green.</li>
  <li data-number="10">The cowslips tall her pensioners be,</li>
  <li>In their gold coats spots you see:</li>
  <li>Those be rubies, fairy favors,</li>
  <li>In those freckles live their savors.</li>
  <li>I must go seek some dewdrops here,</li>
  <li data-number="15">And hang a pearl in every cowslip’s ear.</li>
  <li>Farewell, thou lob of spirits; I’ll be gone.</li>
  <li>Our Queen and all her elves come here anon.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PUCK.">
  <li>The King doth keep his revels here tonight;</li>
  <li>Take heed the Queen come not within his sight;</li>
  <li data-number="20">For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,</li>
  <li>Because that she as her attendant hath</li>
  <li>A lovely boy stolen from an Indian king;</li>
  <li>She never had so sweet a changeling.</li>
  <li>And jealous Oberon would have the child</li>
  <li data-number="25">Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild;</li>
  <li>But she, perforce, withholds the loved boy,</li>
  <li>Crowns him with flowers, and makes him all her joy.</li>
  <li>And now they never meet in grove or green,</li>
  <li>By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,</li>
  <li data-number="30">But they do square, that all their elves for fear</li>
  <li>Creep into acorn-cups, and hide them there.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAIRY.">
  <li>Either I mistake your shape and making quite,</li>
  <li>Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite</li>
  <li>Call’d Robin Goodfellow. Are not you he</li>
  <li data-number="35">That frights the maidens of the villagery,</li>
  <li>Skim milk, and sometimes labor in the quern,</li>
  <li>And bootless make the breathless huswife churn,</li>
  <li>And sometime make the drink to bear no barm,</li>
  <li>Mislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm?</li>
  <li data-number="40">Those that Hobgoblin call you, and sweet Puck,</li>
  <li>You do their work, and they shall have good luck.</li>
  <li>Are not you he?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PUCK.">
  <li data-offset="3">Thou speakest aright;</li>
  <li>I am that merry wanderer of the night.</li>
  <li>I jest to Oberon and make him smile</li>
  <li data-number="45">When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,</li>
  <li>Neighing in likeness of a filly foal;</li>
  <li>And sometime lurk I in a gossip’s bowl,</li>
  <li>In very likeness of a roasted crab,</li>
  <li>And when she drinks, against her lips I bob,</li>
  <li data-number="50">And on her withered dewlop pour the ale.</li>
  <li>The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,</li>
  <li>Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;</li>
  <li>Then slip I from her bum, down topples she,</li>
  <li>And “tailor” cries, and falls into a cough;</li>
  <li data-number="55">And then the whole quire hold their hips and loff,</li>
  <li>And waxen in their mirth, and neeze, and swear</li>
  <li>A merrier hour was never wasted there.</li>
  <li>But room, fairy! Here comes Oberon.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAIRY.">
  <li>And here my mistress. Would that he were gone!</li>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter the King of Fairies Oberon at one door with his Train, and the Queen Titania at another with hers.

</div>

<ol data-speaker="OBE.">
  <li data-number="60">Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TITA.">
  <li>What, jealous Oberon? Fairies, skip hence—</li>
  <li>I have forsworn his bed and company.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OBE.">
  <li>Tarry, rash wanton! Am not I thy lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TITA.">
  <li>Then I must be thy lady; but I know</li>
  <li data-number="65">When thou hast stolen away from fairy land,</li>
  <li>And in the shape of Corin sat all day,</li>
  <li>Playing on pipes of corn, and versing love,</li>
  <li>To amorous Phillida. Why art thou here</li>
  <li>Come from the farthest steep of India?</li>
  <li data-number="70">But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,</li>
  <li>Your buskin’d mistress, and your warrior love,</li>
  <li>To Theseus must be wedded, and you come</li>
  <li>To give their bed joy and prosperity.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OBE.">
  <li>How canst thou thus for shame, Titania,</li>
  <li data-number="75">Glance at my credit with Hippolyta,</li>
  <li>Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?</li>
  <li>Didst not thou lead him through the glimmering night</li>
  <li>From Perigenia, whom he ravished?</li>
  <li>And make him with fair Aegles break his faith,</li>
  <li data-number="80">With Ariadne, and Antiopa?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TITA.">
  <li>These are the forgeries of jealousy;</li>
  <li>And never, since the middle summer’s spring,</li>
  <li>Met we on hill, in dale, forest, or mead,</li>
  <li>By paved fountain or by rushy brook,</li>
  <li data-number="85">Or in the beached margent of the sea,</li>
  <li>To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,</li>
  <li>But with thy brawls thou hast disturb’d our sport.</li>
  <li>Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain,</li>
  <li>As in revenge, have suck’d up from the sea</li>
  <li data-number="90">Contagious fogs; which, falling in the land,</li>
  <li>Hath every pelting river made so proud</li>
  <li>That they have overborne their continents.</li>
  <li>The ox hath therefore stretch’d his yoke in vain,</li>
  <li>The ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn</li>
  <li data-number="95">Hath rotted ere his youth attain’d a beard.</li>
  <li>The fold stands empty in the drowned field,</li>
  <li>And crows are fatted with the murrion flock;</li>
  <li>The nine men’s morris is fill’d up with mud,</li>
  <li>And the quaint mazes in the wanton green,</li>
  <li data-number="100">For lack of tread, are undistinguishable.</li>
  <li>The human mortals want their winter here;</li>
  <li>No night is now with hymn or carol blest.</li>
  <li>Therefore the moon (the governess of floods),</li>
  <li>Pale in her anger, washes all the air,</li>
  <li data-number="105">That rheumatic diseases do abound.</li>
  <li>And thorough this distemperature, we see</li>
  <li>The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts</li>
  <li>Fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose,</li>
  <li>And on old Hiems’ thin and icy crown</li>
  <li data-number="110">An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds</li>
  <li>Is, as in mockery, set; the spring, the summer,</li>
  <li>The childing autumn, angry winter, change</li>
  <li>Their wonted liveries; and the mazed world,</li>
  <li>By their increase, now knows not which is which.</li>
  <li data-number="115">And this same progeny of evils comes</li>
  <li>From our debate, from our dissension;</li>
  <li>We are their parents and original.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OBE.">
  <li>Do you amend it then; it lies in you.</li>
  <li>Why should Titania cross her Oberon?</li>
  <li>I do but beg a little changeling boy,</li>
  <li>To be my henchman.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TITA.">
  <li data-offset="4">Set your heart at rest;</li>
  <li>The fairy land buys not the child of me.</li>
  <li>His mother was a vot’ress of my order,</li>
  <li>And in the spiced Indian air, by night,</li>
  <li data-number="125">Full often hath she gossip’d by my side,</li>
  <li>And sat with me on Neptune’s yellow sands,</li>
  <li>Marking th’ embarked traders on the flood;</li>
  <li>When we have laugh’d to see the sails conceive</li>
  <li>And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;</li>
  <li data-number="130">Which she, with pretty and with swimming gait,</li>
  <li>Following (her womb then rich with my young squire)</li>
  <li>Would imitate, and sail upon the land</li>
  <li>To fetch me trifles, and return again,</li>
  <li>As from a voyage, rich with merchandise.</li>
  <li data-number="135">But she, being mortal, of that boy did die,</li>
  <li>And for her sake do I rear up her boy;</li>
  <li>And for her sake I will not part with him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OBE.">
  <li>How long within this wood intend you stay?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TITA.">
  <li>Perchance till after Theseus’ wedding-day.</li>
  <li data-number="140">If you will patiently dance in our round,</li>
  <li>And see our moonlight revels, go with us;</li>
  <li>If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OBE.">
  <li>Give me that boy, and I will go with thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TITA.">
  <li>Not for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away!</li>
  <li data-number="145">We shall chide downright, if I longer stay.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OBE.">
  <li>Well; go thy way. Thou shalt not from this grove</li>
  <li>Till I torment thee for this injury.</li>
  <li>My gentle Puck, come hither. Thou rememb’rest</li>
  <li>Since once I sat upon a promontory,</li>
  <li data-number="150">And heard a mermaid on a dolphin’s back</li>
  <li>Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath</li>
  <li>That the rude sea grew civil at her song,</li>
  <li>And certain stars shot madly from their spheres,</li>
  <li>To hear the sea-maid’s music?</li>

<ol data-speaker="PUCK.">
  <li data-offset="6">I remember.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OBE.">
  <li data-number="155">That very time I saw (but thou couldst not),</li>
  <li>Flying between the cold moon and the earth,</li>
  <li>Cupid all arm’d. A certain aim he took</li>
  <li>At a fair vestal throned by the west,</li>
  <li>And loos’d his love-shaft smartly from his bow,</li>
  <li data-number="160">As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts;</li>
  <li>But I might see young Cupid’s fiery shaft</li>
  <li>Quench’d in the chaste beams of the wat’ry moon,</li>
  <li>And the imperial vot’ress passed on,</li>
  <li>In maiden meditation, fancy-free.</li>
  <li data-number="165">Yet mark’d I where the bolt of Cupid fell.</li>
  <li>It fell upon a little western flower,</li>
  <li>Before milk-white, now purple with love’s wound,</li>
  <li>And maidens call it love-in-idleness.</li>
  <li>Fetch me that flow’r; the herb I showed thee once.</li>
  <li data-number="170">The juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid</li>
  <li>Will make or man or woman madly dote</li>
  <li>Upon the next live creature that it sees.</li>
  <li>Fetch me this herb, and be thou here again</li>
  <li>Ere the leviathan can swim a league.</li>

<ol data-speaker="BOT.">
  <li>Are we all met?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUIN.">
  <li>Pat, pat; and here’s a marvail’s convenient place for our rehearsal. This green plot shall be our stage, this hawthorn brake our tiring-house, and we will do it in action as we will do it before the Duke.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOT.">
  <li>Peter Quince!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUIN.">
  <li>What sayest thou, bully Bottom?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOT.">
  <li data-number="5">There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and Thisbe that will never please. First, Pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself; which the ladies cannot abide. How answer you that?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SNOUT.">
  <li>By’r lakin, a parlous fear.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="STAR.">
  <li>I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOT.">
  <li>Not a whit! I have a device to make all well. Write me a prologue, and let the prologue seem to say we will do no harm with our swords, and that Pyramus is not kill’d indeed; and for the more better assurance, tell them that I Pyramus am not Pyramus, but Bottom the weaver. This will put them out of fear.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUIN.">
  <li>Well; we will have such a prologue, and it shall be written in eight and six.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOT.">
  <li data-number="10">No; make it two more; let it be written in eight and eight.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SNOUT.">
  <li>Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="STAR.">
  <li>I fear it, I promise you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOT.">
  <li>Masters, you ought to consider with yourselves, to bring in (God shield us!) a lion among ladies, is a most dreadful thing; for there is not a more fearful wild-fowl than your lion living; and we ought to look to’t.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SNOUT.">
  <li>Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOT.">
  <li data-number="15">Nay; you must name his name, and half his face must be seen through the lion’s neck, and he himself muse speak through, saying thus, or to the same defect: “Ladies,” or “Fair ladies, I would wish you,” or “I would request you,” or “I would entreat you, not to fear, not to tremble: my life for yours. If you think I come hither as a lion, it were pity of my life. No! I am no such thing; I am a man as other men are”; and there indeed let him name his name, and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUIN.">
  <li>Well; it shall be so. But there is two hard things: that is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber; for you know, Pyramus and Thisbe meet by moonlight.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SNOUT.">
  <li>Doth the moon shine that night we play our play?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOT.">
  <li>A calendar, a calendar! Look in the almanac. Find out moonshine, find out moonshine.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUIN.">
  <li>Yes; it doth shine that night.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOT.">
  <li data-number="20">Why then may you leave a casement of the great chamber window (where we play) open; and the moon may shine in at the casement.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUIN.">
  <li>Ay; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a lantern, and say he comes to disfigure, or to present, the person of Moonshine. Then, there is another thing: we must have a wall in the great chamber; for Pyramus and Thisbe (says the story) did talk through the chink of a wall.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SNOUT.">
  <li>You can never bring in a wall. What say you, Bottom?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOT.">
  <li>Some man or other must present Wall; and let him have some plaster, or some loam, or some rough-cast about him, to signify wall; or let him hold his fingers thus, and through that cranny shall Pyramus and Thisbe whisper.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUIN.">
  <li>If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit down, every mother’s son, and rehearse your parts. Pyramus, you begin. When you have spoken your speech, enter into that brake; and so every one according to his cue.</li>

  <li>My mistress with a monster is in love.</li>
  <li>Near to her close and consecrated bower,</li>

  <li>A crew of patches, rude mechanicals,</li>
  <li data-number="10">That work for bread upon Athenian stalls,</li>
  <li>Were met together to rehearse a play</li>

  <li>The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort,</li>
  <li>Who Pyramus presented, in their sport,</li>
  <li data-number="15">Forsook his scene, and ent’red in a brake;</li>
  <li>When I did him at this advantage take,</li>
  <li>An ass’s nole I fixed on his head.</li>
  <li>Anon his Thisbe must be answered,</li>
  <li>And forth my mimic comes. When they him spy,</li>
  <li data-number="20">As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye,</li>
  <li>Or russet-pated choughs, many in sort</li>
  <li>(Rising and cawing at the gun’s report),</li>

  <li>So, at his sight, away his fellows fly;</li>
  <li data-number="25">And at our stamp, here o’er and o’er one falls;</li>
  <li>He murder cries, and help from Athens calls.</li>
  <li>Their sense thus weak, lost with their fears thus strong,</li>
  <li>Made senseless things begin to do them wrong,</li>
  <li>For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch;</li>
  <li data-number="30">Some sleeves, some hats, from yielders all things catch.</li>
  <li>I led them on in this distracted fear,</li>
  <li>And left sweet Pyramus translated there;</li>

  <li data-number="130">But, as I think—for truly would I speak,</li>
  <li>And now I do bethink me, so it is—</li>
  <li>I came with Hermia hither. Our intent</li>

  <li>Without the peril of the Athenian law—</li>

  <li>My lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth,</li>

  <li data-number="145">But, my good lord, I wot not by what power</li>
  <li>(But by some power it is), my love to Hermia</li>
  <li>(Melted as the snow) seems to me now</li>
  <li>As the remembrance of an idle gaud,</li>
  <li>Which in my childhood I did dote upon;</li>
  <li data-number="150">And all the faith, the virtue of my heart,</li>
  <li>The object and the pleasure of mine eye,</li>

  <li>But like a sickness did I loathe this food;</li>
  <li data-number="155">But, as in health, come to my natural taste,</li>

God’s my life, stol’n hence, and left me asleep! I have had a most rare vision. I have had a dream, past the wit of man to say what dream it was. Man is but an ass, if he go about t’ expound this dream. Methought I was—there is no man can tell what. Methought I was, and methought I had—but man is but a patch’d fool, if he will offer to say what methought I had. The eye of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not seen, man’s hand is not able to taste, his tongue to conceive, nor his heart to report, what my dream was. I will get Peter Quince to write a ballet of this dream. It shall be call’d “Bottom’s Dream,” because it hath no bottom; and I will sing it in the latter end of a play, before the Duke. Peradventure, to make it the more gracious, I shall sing it at her death.</li>

  <li>’Tis strange, my Theseus, that these lovers speak of.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="THE.">
  <li>More strange than true. I never may believe</li>

  <li>Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,</li>

  <li>More than cool reason ever comprehends.</li>
  <li>The lunatic, the lover, and the poet</li>
  <li>Are of imagination all compact.</li>
  <li>One sees more devils than vast hell can hold;</li>
  <li data-number="10">That is the madman. The lover, all as frantic,</li>
  <li>Sees Helen’s beauty in a brow of Egypt.</li>
  <li>The poet’s eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,</li>
  <li>Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;</li>
  <li>And as imagination bodies forth</li>
  <li data-number="15">The forms of things unknown, the poet’s pen</li>
  <li>Turns them to shapes, and gives to aery nothing</li>
  <li>A local habitation and a name.</li>
  <li>Such tricks hath strong imagination,</li>
  <li>That if it would but apprehend some joy,</li>
  <li data-number="20">It comprehends some bringer of that joy;</li>
  <li>Or in the night, imagining some fear,</li>
  <li>How easy is a bush suppos’d a bear!</li>

  <li>A play there is, my lord, some ten words long,</li>
