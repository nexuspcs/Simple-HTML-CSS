When I burnt in desire to question them further, they made themselves air, into which they vanish’d. Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came missives from the King, who all-hail’d me “Thane of Cawdor,” by which title, before, these weird sisters saluted me, and referr’d me to the coming on of time with “Hail, King that shalt be!” This have I thought good to deliver thee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thou mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing by being ignorant of what greatness is promis’d thee. Lay it to thy heart, and farewell.”</recite></li>
  <li>Glamis thou art, and Cawdor, and shalt be</li>
  <li>What thou art promis’d. Yet do I fear thy nature,</li>

  <li>How it did grieve Macbeth! Did he not straight</li>

  <li>We have willing dames enough; there cannot be</li>
  <li>That vulture in you to devour so many</li>
  <li>As will to greatness dedicate themselves,</li>
  <li>Finding it so inclin’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MAL.">
  <li data-offset="4">With this, there grows</li>
  <li>In my most ill-compos’d affection such</li>

  <li>I should cut off the nobles for their lands,</li>
  <li data-number="80">Desire his jewels, and this other’s house,</li>
  <li>And my more-having would be as a sauce</li>
  <li>To make me hunger more, that I should forge</li>
  <li>Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,</li>
  <li>Destroying them for wealth.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MACD.">
  <li data-offset="6">This avarice</li>

  <li>The sword of our slain kings. Yet do not fear,</li>

  <li>Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,</li>
  <li>Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,</li>
  <li data-number="95">I have no relish of them, but abound</li>
  <li>In the division of each several crime,</li>
  <li>Acting it many ways. Nay, had I pow’r, I should</li>
