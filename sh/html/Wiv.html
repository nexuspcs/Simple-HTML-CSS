		EVANS.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="SHAL.">
  <li>Sir Hugh, persuade me not; I will make a Star Chamber matter of it. If he were twenty Sir John Falstaffs, he shall not abuse Robert Shallow, esquire.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SLEN.">
  <li>In the county of Gloucester, Justice of Peace and Coram.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHAL.">
  <li>Ay, cousin Slender, and Custa-lorum.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SLEN.">
  <li>Ay, and Rato-lorum too; and a gentleman born, Master Parson, who writes himself Armigero, in any bill, warrant, quittance, or obligation, Armigero.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHAL.">
  <li data-number="5">Ay, that I do, and have done any time these three hundred years.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SLEN.">
  <li>All his successors (gone before him) hath done’t; and all his ancestors (that come after him) may. They may give the dozen white luces in their coat.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHAL.">
  <li>It is an old coat.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EVANS.">
  <li>The dozen white louses do become an old coat well; it agrees well, passant. It is a familiar beast to man, and signifies love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHAL.">
  <li>The luce is the fresh fish, the salt fish is an old coat.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SLEN.">
  <li data-number="10">I may quarter, coz.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHAL.">
  <li>You may, by marrying.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EVANS.">
  <li>It is marring indeed, if he quarter it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHAL.">
  <li>Not a whit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EVANS.">
  <li>Yes, py’r lady. If he has a quarter of your coat, there is but three skirts for yourself, in my simple conjectures. But that is all one. If Sir John Falstaff have committed disparagements unto you, I am of the church, and will be glad to do my benevolence to make atonements and compromises between you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHAL.">
  <li data-number="15">The Council shall hear it, it is a riot.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EVANS.">
  <li>It is not meet the Council hear a riot; there is no fear of Got in a riot. The Council, look you, shall desire to hear the fear of Got, and not to hear a riot. Take your vizaments in that.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHAL.">
  <li>Ha! O’ my life, if I were young again, the sword should end it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EVANS.">
  <li>It is petter that friends is the sword, and end it; and there is also another device in my prain, which peradventure prings goot discretions with it: there is Anne Page, which is daughter to Master George Page, which is pretty virginity.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SLEN.">
  <li>Mistress Anne Page? She has brown hair, and speaks small like a woman.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EVANS.">
  <li data-number="20">It is that fery person for all the orld, as just as you will desire, and seven hundred pounds of moneys, and gold, and silver, is her grandsire upon his death’s-bed (Got deliver to a joyful resurrections!) give, when she is able to overtake seventeen years old. It were a goot motion if we leave our pribbles and prabbles, and desire a marriage between Master Abraham and Mistress Anne Page.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SLEN.">
  <li>Did her grandsire leave her seven hundred pound?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EVANS.">
  <li>Ay, and her father is make her a petter penny.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SLEN.">
  <li>I know the young gentlewoman, she has good gifts.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EVANS.">
  <li>Seven hundred pounds, and possibilities, is goot gifts.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHAL.">
  <li data-number="25">Well, let us see honest Master Page. Is Falstaff there?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EVANS.">
  <li>Shall I tell you a lie? I do despise a liar as I do despise one that is false, or as I despise one that is not true. The knight Sir John is there, and I beseech you be rul’d by your well-willers. I will peat the door for Master Page.</li>

  <li>He hath wrong’d me, Master Page.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAGE.">
  <li>Sir, he doth in some sort confess it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHAL.">
  <li data-number="45">If it be confess’d, it is not redress’d. Is not that so, Master Page? He hath wrong’d me, indeed he hath, at a word he hath. Believe me, Robert Shallow, esquire, saith he is wrong’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAGE.">

  <li>Now, Master Shallow, you’ll complain of me to the King?</li>

<ol data-speaker="SHAL.">
  <li>Knight, you have beaten my men, kill’d my deer, and broke open my lodge.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li>But not kiss’d your keeper’s daughter?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHAL.">
  <li data-number="50">Tut, a pin! This shall be answer’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li>I will answer it straight: I have done all this. That is now answer’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHAL.">
  <li>The Council shall know this.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li>’Twere better for you if it were known in counsel. You’ll be laugh’d at.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EVANS.">
  <li><foreign xml:lang="la">Pauca verba</foreign>; Sir John, good worts.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li data-number="55">Good worts? Good cabbage. Slender, I broke your head; what matter have you against me?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SLEN.">
  <li>Marry, sir, I have matter in my head against you, and against your cony-catching rascals, Bardolph, Nym, and Pistol. They carried me to the tavern and made me drunk, and afterward pick’d my pocket.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BARD.">
  <li>You Banbury cheese!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SLEN.">
  <li>Ay, it is no matter.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PIST.">
  <li>How now, Mephostophilus?</li>

<ol data-speaker="SLEN.">
  <li data-number="60">Ay, it is no matter.</li>

<ol data-speaker="SLEN.">
  <li>Where’s Simple, my man? Can you tell, cousin?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EVANS.">
  <li>Peace, I pray you. Now let us understand. There is three umpires in this matter, as I understand: that is, Master Page (<foreign xml:lang="la">fidelicet</foreign> Master Page) and there is myself (<foreign xml:lang="la">fidelicet</foreign> myself) and the three party is (lastly and finally) mine host of the Garter.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAGE.">
  <li>We three to hear it and end it between them.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EVANS.">
  <li data-number="65">Fery goot. I will make a prief of it in my note-book, and we will afterwards ork upon the cause with as great discreetly as we can.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li>Pistol!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PIST.">
  <li>He hears with ears.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EVANS.">
  <li>The tevil and his tam! What phrase is this? “He hears with ear”? Why, it is affectations.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li>Pistol, did you pick Master Slender’s purse?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SLEN.">
  <li data-number="70">Ay, by these gloves, did he, or I would I might never come in mine own great chamber again else, of seven groats in mill-sixpences, and two Edward shovel-boards, that cost me two shilling and two pence a-piece of Yead Miller—by these gloves.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li>Is this true, Pistol?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EVANS.">
  <li>No, it is false, if it is a pick-purse.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PIST.">
  <li>Ha, thou mountain-foreigner! Sir John, and master mine,</li>
  <li>I combat challenge of this latten bilbo.</li>
  <li data-number="75">Word of denial in thy <foreign xml:lang="la">labras</foreign> here!</li>
  <li>Word of denial! Froth and scum, thou liest!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SLEN.">
  <li>By these gloves, then ’twas he.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NYM.">
  <li>Be avis’d, sir, and pass good humors. I will say “marry trap” with you, if you run the nuthook’s humor on me—that is the very note of it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SLEN.">
  <li>By this hat, then he in the red face had it; for though I cannot remember what I did when you made me drunk, yet I am not altogether an ass.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li data-number="80">What say you, Scarlet and John?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BARD.">
  <li>Why, sir, for my part, I say the gentleman had drunk himself out of his five sentences.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EVANS.">
  <li>It is his five senses. Fie, what the ignorance is!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BARD.">
  <li>And being fap, sir, was (as they say) cashier’d; and so conclusions pass’d the careers.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SLEN.">
  <li>Ay, you spake in Latin then too: but ’tis no matter; I’ll ne’er be drunk whilst I live again, but in honest, civil, godly company, for this trick. If I be drunk, I’ll be drunk with those that have the fear of God, and not with drunken knaves.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EVANS.">
  <li data-number="85">So Got udge me, that is a virtuous mind.</li>

  <li data-number="95">Come, coz, come, coz, we stay for you. A word with you, coz; marry, this, coz: there is as ’twere a tender, a kind of tender, made afar off by Sir Hugh here. Do you understand me?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SLEN.">
  <li>Ay, sir, you shall find me reasonable. If it be so, I shall do that that is reason.</li>

<ol data-speaker="SHAL.">
  <li>Nay, but understand me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SLEN.">
  <li>So I do, sir.</li>

  <li>Give ear to his motions: Master Slender, I will description the matter to you, if you be capacity of it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SLEN.">
  <li data-number="100">Nay, I will do as my cousin Shallow says. I pray you pardon me; he’s a Justice of Peace in his country, simple though I stand here.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EVANS.">
  <li>But that is not the question: the question is concerning your marriage.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHAL.">
  <li>Ay, there’s the point, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EVANS.">
  <li>Marry, is it; the very point of it—to Mistress Anne Page.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SLEN.">
  <li>Why, if it be so, I will marry her upon any reasonable demands.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EVANS.">
  <li data-number="105">But can you affection the oman? Let us command to know that of your mouth, or of your lips; for divers philosophers hold that the lips is parcel of the mouth. Therefore precisely, can you carry your good will to the maid?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHAL.">
  <li>Cousin Abraham Slender, can you love her?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SLEN.">
  <li>I hope, sir, I will do as it shall become one that would do reason.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EVANS.">
  <li>Nay, Got’s lords and his ladies, you must speak possitable, if you can carry her your desires towards her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHAL.">
  <li>That you must. Will you, upon good dowry, marry her?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SLEN.">
  <li data-number="110">I will do a greater thing than that, upon your request, cousin, in any reason.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHAL.">
  <li>Nay, conceive me, conceive me, sweet coz; what I do is to pleasure you, coz. Can you love the maid?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SLEN.">
  <li>I will marry her, sir, at your request; but if there be no great love in the beginning, yet heaven may decrease it upon better acquaintance, when we are married and have more occasion to know one another. I hope, upon familiarity will grow more content. But if you say, “Marry her,” I will marry her; that I am freely dissolv’d, and dissolutely.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EVANS.">
  <li>It is a fery discretion answer, save the fall is in the ord “dissolutely.” The ort is (according to our meaning) “resolutely.” His meaning is good.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHAL.">
  <li>Ay—I think my cousin meant well.</li>

I spy entertainment in her. She discourses, she carves, she gives the leer of invitation.

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PIST.">
  <li>Then did the sun on dunghill shine.</li>

<ol data-speaker="NYM.">
  <li>I thank thee for that humor.</li>

  <li>O, she did so course o’er my exteriors with such a greedy intention, that the appetite of her eye did seem to scorch me up like a burning-glass! Here’s another letter to her. She bears the purse too; she is a region in Guiana, all gold and bounty. I will be cheaters to them both, and they shall be exchequers to me. They shall be my East and West Indies, and I will trade to them both. Go, bear thou this letter to Mistress Page; and thou this to Mistress Ford. We will thrive, lads, we will thrive.</li>

He will print them, out of doubt; for he cares not what he puts into the press, when he would put us two. I had rather be a giantess, and lie under Mount Pelion.

<ol data-speaker="QUICK.">
  <li>Marry, this is the short and the long of it: you have brought her into such a canaries as ’tis wonderful. The best courtier of them all (when the court lay at Windsor) could never have brought her to such a canary; yet there has been knights, and lords, and gentlemen, with their coaches; I warrant you, coach after coach, letter after letter, gift after gift; smelling so sweetly, all musk, and so rushling, I warrant you, in silk and gold, and in such alligant terms, and in such wine and sugar of the best, and the fairest, that would have won any woman’s heart; and I warrant you, they could never get an eye-wink of her. I had myself twenty angels given me this morning, but I defy all angels (in any such sort, as they say) but in the way of honesty; and I warrant you, they could never get her so much as sip on a cup with the proudest of them all, and yet there has been earls, nay (which is more) pensioners, but I warrant you all is one with her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li>But what says she to me? Be brief, my good she-Mercury.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUICK.">
  <li data-number="30">Marry, she hath receiv’d your letter—for the which she thanks you a thousand times—and she gives you to notify that her husband will be absence from his house between ten and eleven.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li>Ten and eleven?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUICK.">
  <li>Ay, forsooth; and then you may come and see the picture, she says, that you wot of. Master Ford her husband will be from home. Alas, the sweet woman leads an ill life with him. He’s a very jealousy man. She leads a very frampold life with him, good heart.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li>Ten and eleven. Woman, commend me to her, I will not fail her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUICK.">
  <li>Why, you say well. But I have another messenger to your worship. Mistress Page hath her hearty commendations to you too; and let me tell you in your ear, she’s as fartuous a civil modest wife, and one (I tell you) that will not miss you morning nor evening prayer, as any is in Windsor, whoe’er be the other; and she bade me tell your worship that her husband is seldom from home, but she hopes there will come a time. I never knew a woman so dote upon a man; surely I think you have charms, la; yes, in truth.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li data-number="35">Not I, I assure thee. Setting the attraction of my good parts aside, I have no other charms.</li>

  <li>But I pray thee tell me this: has Ford’s wife and Page’s wife acquainted each other how they love me?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUICK.">
  <li>That were a jest indeed! They have not so little grace, I hope. That were a trick indeed! But Mistress Page would desire you to send her your little page, of all loves. Her husband has a marvelous infection to the little page; and truly Master Page is an honest man. Never a wife in Windsor leads a better life than she does: do what she will, say what she will, take all, pay all, go to bed when she list, rise when she list, all is as she will; and truly she deserves it, for if there be a kind woman in Windsor, she is one. You must send her your page, no remedy.</li>

  <li>Why, I will.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUICK.">
  <li data-number="40">Nay, but do so then, and look you, he may come and go between you both; and in any case have a nay-word, that you may know one another’s mind, and the boy never need to understand any thing; for ’tis not good that children should know any wickedness. Old folks, you know, have discretion, as they say, and know the world.</li>

<ol data-speaker="FORD.">
  <li>Like a fair house built on another man’s ground, so that I have lost my edifice by mistaking the place where I erected it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li>To what purpose have you unfolded this to me?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FORD.">
  <li>When I have told you that, I have told you all. Some say that, though she appear honest to me, yet in other places she enlargeth her mirth so far that there is shrewd construction made of her. Now, Sir John, here is the heart of my purpose: you are a gentleman of excellent breeding, admirable discourse, of great admittance, authentic in your place and person, generally allow’d for your many war-like, court-like, and learned preparations.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li>O sir!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FORD.">
  <li data-number="80">Believe it, for you know it. There is money, spend it, spend it; spend more; spend all I have; only give me so much of your time in exchange of it, as to lay an amiable siege to the honesty of this Ford’s wife. Use your art of wooing; win her to consent to you; if any man may, you may as soon as any.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li>Would it apply well to the vehemency of your affection, that I should win what you would enjoy? Methinks you prescribe to yourself very preposterously.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FORD.">
  <li>O, understand my drift. She dwells so securely on the excellency of her honor, that the folly of my soul dares not present itself; she is too bright to be look’d against. Now, could I come to her with any detection in my hand, my desires had instance and argument to commend themselves. I could drive her then from the ward of her purity, her reputation, her marriage vow, and a thousand other her defenses, which now are too too strongly embattled against me. What say you to’t, Sir John?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li>Master Brook, I will first make bold with your money; next, give me your hand; and last, as I am a gentleman, you shall, and you will, enjoy Ford’s wife.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FORD.">
  <li>O good sir!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li data-number="85">I say you shall.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FORD.">
  <li>Want no money, Sir John, you shall want none.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li>Want no Mistress Ford, Master Brook, you shall want none. I shall be with her (I may tell you) by her own appointment; even as you came in to me, her assistant or go-between parted from me. I say I shall be with her between ten and eleven; for at that time the jealous rascally knave her husband will be forth. Come you to me at night, you shall know how I speed.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FORD.">
  <li>I am blest in your acquaintance. Do you know Ford, sir?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li>Hang him, poor cuckoldly knave, I know him not. Yet I wrong him to call him poor. They say the jealous wittolly knave hath masses of money, for the which his wife seems to me well-favor’d. I will use her as the key of the cuckoldly rogue’s coffer, and there’s my harvest-home.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FORD.">
  <li data-number="90">I would you knew Ford, sir, that you might avoid him if you saw him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li>Hang him, mechanical salt-butter rogue! I will stare him out of his wits; I will awe him with my cudgel; it shall hang like a meteor o’er the cuckold’s horns. Master Brook, thou shalt know I will predominate over the peasant, and thou shalt lie with his wife. Come to me soon at night. Ford’s a knave, and I will aggravate his style; thou, Master Brook, shalt know him for knave, and cuckold. Come to me soon at night.</li>

<ol data-speaker="FORD.">
  <li>What a damn’d Epicurean rascal is this! My heart is ready to crack with impatience. Who says this is improvident jealousy? My wife hath sent to him, the hour is fix’d, the match is made. Would any man have thought this? See the hell of having a false woman! My bed shall be abus’d, my coffers ransack’d, my reputation gnawn at, and I shall not only receive this villainous wrong, but stand under the adoption of abominable terms, and by him that does me this wrong. Terms! Names! Amaimon sounds well; Lucifer, well; Barbason, well; yet they are devils’ additions, the names of fiends; but Cuckold! Wittol!—Cuckold! The devil himself hath not such a name. Page is an ass, a secure ass; he will trust his wife, he will not be jealous. I will rather trust a Fleming with my butter, Parson Hugh the Welshman with my cheese, an Irishman with my aqua-vitae bottle, or a thief to walk my ambling gelding, than my wife with herself. Then she plots, then she ruminates, then she devises; and what they think in their hearts they may effect, they will break their hearts but they will effect. God be prais’d for my jealousy! Eleven o’ clock the hour. I will prevent this, detect my wife, be reveng’d on Falstaff, and laugh at Page. I will about it; better three hours too soon than a minute too late. Fie, fie, fie!

And Falstaff’s boy with her! Good plots, they are laid, and our revolted wives share damnation together. Well, I will take him, then torture my wife, pluck the borrow’d veil of modesty from the so-seeming Mistress Page, divulge Page himself for a secure and willful Actaeon; and to these violent proceedings all my neighbors shall cry aim.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">
	Clock heard.

  <li>The clock gives me my cue, and my assurance bids me search—there I shall find Falstaff. I shall be rather prais’d for this than mock’d; for it is as positive as the earth is firm that Falstaff is there. I will go.</li>

  <li>Now, Master Brook, you come to know what hath pass’d between me and Ford’s wife?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FORD.">
  <li>That indeed, Sir John, is my business.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li>Master Brook, I will not lie to you. I was at her house the hour she appointed me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FORD.">
  <li>And sped you, sir?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li data-number="30">Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FORD.">
  <li>How so, sir? Did she change her determination?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li>No, Master Brook, but the peaking cornuto her husband, Master Brook, dwelling in a continual ’larum of jealousy, comes me in the instant of our encounter, after we had embrac’d, kiss’d, protested, and, as it were, spoke the prologue of our comedy; and at his heels a rabble of his companions, thither provok’d and instigated by his distemper, and, forsooth, to search his house for his wive’s love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FORD.">
  <li>What? While you were there?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li>While I was there.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FORD.">
  <li data-number="35">And did he search for you, and could not find you?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li>You shall hear. As good luck would have it, comes in one Mistress Page; gives intelligence of Ford’s approach; and in her invention, and Ford’s wive’s distraction, they convey’d me into a buck-basket.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FORD.">
  <li>A buck-basket?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li>By the Lord, a buck-basket! Ramm’d me in with foul shirts and smocks, socks, foul stockings, greasy napkins, that, Master Brook, there was the rankest compound of villainous smell that ever offended nostril.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FORD.">
  <li>And how long lay you there?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li data-number="40">Nay, you shall hear, Master Brook, what I have suffer’d to bring this woman to evil for your good. Being thus cramm’d in the basket, a couple of Ford’s knaves, his hinds, were call’d forth by their mistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to Datchet-lane. They took me on their shoulders; met the jealous knave their master in the door, who ask’d them once or twice what they had in their basket. I quak’d for fear, lest the lunatic knave would have search’d it; but fate (ordaining he should be a cuckold) held his hand. Well, on went he for a search, and away went I for foul clothes. But mark the sequel, Master Brook. I suffer’d the pangs of three several deaths: first, an intolerable fright, to be detected with a jealous rotten bell-wether; next, to be compass’d like a good bilbo in the circumference of a peck, hilt to point, heel to head; and then to be stopp’d in like a strong distillation with stinking clothes that fretted in their own grease. Think of that—a man of my kidney. Think of that—that am as subject to heat as butter; a man of continual dissolution and thaw. It was a miracle to scape suffocation. And in the height of this bath (when I was more than half stew’d in grease, like a Dutch dish) to be thrown into the Thames, and cool’d, glowing-hot, in that surge, like a horse-shoe; think of that—hissing-hot—think of that, Master Brook.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FORD.">
  <li>In good sadness, sir, I am sorry that for my sake you have suffer’d all this. My suit then is desperate; you’ll undertake her no more?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li>Master Brook, I will be thrown into Etna, as I have been into Thames, ere I will leave her thus. Her husband is this morning gone a-birding. I have receiv’d from her another embassy of meeting. ’Twixt eight and nine is the hour, Master Brook.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FORD.">
  <li>’Tis past eight already, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li>Is it? I will then address me to my appointment. Come to me at your convenient leisure, and you shall know how I speed; and the conclusion shall be crown’d with your enjoying her. <foreign xml:lang="fr">Adieu</foreign>. You shall have her, Master Brook. Master Brook, you shall cuckold Ford.</li>

This ’tis to have linen and buck-baskets! Well, I will proclaim myself what I am. I will now take the lecher; he is at my house. He cannot scape me; ’tis impossible he should; he cannot creep into a halfpenny purse, nor into a pepper-box. But lest the devil that guides him should aid him, I will search impossible places. Though what I am I cannot avoid, yet to be what I would not shall not make me tame. If I have horns to make one mad, let the proverb go with me: I’ll be horn-mad.</li>

  <li>Why, woman, your husband is in his old lines again.

I am glad the fat knight is not here.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MRS. FORD.">
  <li>Why, does he talk of him?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MRS. PAGE.">
  <li>Of none but him, and swears he was carried out, the last time he search’d for him, in a basket; protests to my husband he is now here, and hath drawn him and the rest of their company from their sport, to make another experiment of his suspicion. But I am glad the knight is not here. Now he shall see his own foolery.</li>

  <li data-number="45">As Falstaff, she, and I are newly met,</li>
  <li>Let them from forth a sawpit rush at once</li>
  <li>With some diffused song. Upon their sight,</li>
  <li>We two in great amazedness will fly;</li>
  <li>Then let them all encircle him about,</li>

	Here they pinch him and sing about him. And the Doctor Caius comes one way, and steals away a boy in green; and Slender another way; he takes a boy in white; and Fenton steals Mistress Anne Page. And a noise of hunting is made within; and all the fairies run away. Falstaff pulls off his buck’s head, and rises up.

  <li>Nay, do not fly, I think we have watch’d you now.</li>

  <li>I pray you come, hold up the jest no higher.</li>
  <li data-number="80">Now, good Sir John, how like you Windsor wives?</li>
  <li>See you these, husband? Do not these fair yokes</li>
  <li>Become the forest better than the town?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FORD.">
  <li>Now, sir, who’s a cuckold now? Master Brook, Falstaff’s a knave, a cuckoldly knave; here are his horns, Master Brook; and, Master Brook, he hath enjoy’d nothing of Ford’s 
but his buck-basket his cudgel, and twenty pounds of money, which must be paid to Master Brook. His horses are arrested for it, Master Brook.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MRS. FORD.">
  <li>Sir John, we have had ill luck; we could never meet. I will never take you for my love again, but I will always count you my deer.</li>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li data-number="85">I do begin to perceive that I am made an ass.</li>

  <li>Ay, and an ox too; both the proofs are extant.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li>And these are not fairies? I was three or four times in the thought they were not fairies, and yet the guiltiness of my mind, the sudden surprise of my powers, drove the grossness of the foppery into a receiv’d belief, in despite of the teeth of all rhyme and reason, that they were fairies. See now how wit may be made a Jack-a-Lent, when ’tis upon ill employment!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EVANS.">
  <li>Sir John Falstaff, serve Got, and leave your desires, and fairies will not pinse you.</li>

  <li>Well said, fairy Hugh.</li>

  <li>I will never mistrust my wife again, till thou art able to woo her in good English.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li>Have I laid my brain in the sun and dried it, that it wants matter to prevent so gross o’erreaching as this? Am I ridden with a Welsh goat too? Shall I have a coxcomb of frieze? ’Tis time I were chok’d with a piece of toasted cheese.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EVANS.">
  <li>Seese is not good to give putter; your belly is all putter.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li>“Seese” and “putter”! Have I liv’d to stand at the taunt of one that makes fritters of English? 
This is enough to be the decay of lust and late-walking through the realm.</li>

<ol data-speaker="MRS. PAGE.">
  <li data-number="95">Why, Sir John, do you think, though we would have thrust virtue out of our hearts by the head and shoulders, and have given ourselves without scruple to hell, that ever the devil could have made you our delight?</li>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li>Well, I am your theme. You have the start of me, I am dejected. I am not able to answer the Welsh flannel; ignorance itself is a plummet o’er me. 
Use me as you will.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FORD.">
  <li>Marry, sir, we’ll bring you to Windsor, to one Master Brook that you have cozen’d of money, to whom you should have been a pander. Over and above that you have suffer’d, I think to repay that money will be a biting affliction.</li>

<ol data-speaker="PAGE.">
  <li data-number="105">Yet be cheerful, knight. Thou shalt eat a posset tonight at my house, where I will desire thee to laugh at my wife, that now laughs at thee. Tell her Master Slender hath married her daughter.</li>

  <li>Son? How now? How now, son? Have you dispatch’d?</li>

  <li data-number="110">Of what, son?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SLEN.">
  <li>I came yonder at Eton to marry Mistress Anne Page, and she’s a great lubberly boy. If it had not been i’ th’ church, I would have swing’d him, or he should have swing’d me. If I did not think it had been Anne Page, would I might never stir!—and ’tis a postmaster’s boy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAGE.">
  <li>Upon my life then, you took the wrong.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SLEN.">
  <li>When need you tell me that? I think so, when I took a boy for a girl. If I had been married to him (for all he was in woman’s apparel) I would not have had him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAGE.">
  <li>Why, this is your own folly. Did not I tell you how you should know my daughter by her garments?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SLEN.">
  <li data-number="115">I went to her in white and cried “mum,” and she cried “budget,” as Anne and I had appointed, and yet it was not Anne, but a postmaster’s boy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MRS. PAGE.">
  <li>Good George, be not angry. I knew of your purpose; turn’d my daughter into green; and indeed she is now with the Doctor at the dean’ry, and there married.</li>

<ol data-speaker="FENT.">
  <li>You do amaze her. Hear the truth of it.</li>
  <li>You would have married her most shamefully,</li>
  <li>Where there was no proportion held in love.</li>
  <li>The truth is, she and I (long since contracted)</li>
  <li data-number="130">Are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us.</li>
  <li>Th’ offense is holy that she hath committed,</li>
  <li>And this deceit loses the name of craft,</li>
  <li>Of disobedience, or unduteous title,</li>
  <li>Since therein she doth evitate and shun</li>
  <li data-number="135">A thousand irreligious cursed hours</li>
  <li>Which forced marriage would have brought upon her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FORD.">
  <li>Stand not amaz’d; here is no remedy.</li>
  <li>In love, the heavens themselves do guide the state;</li>
  <li>Money buys lands, and wives are sold by fate.</li>

  <li>Good husband, let us every one go home,</li>
