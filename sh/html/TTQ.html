<h1 id="title">To the Queen</h1>


<section class="stanza">
  <p>As the dial hand tells o’er</p>
  <p>The same hours it had before,</p>
  <p>Circular account still lending,</p>
  <p>So, most mighty Queen we pray,</p>
  <p>Like the dial day by day</p>
  <p>You may lead the seasons on,</p>
  <p>Making new when old are gone,</p>
  <p>That the babe which now is young</p>
  <p>And hath yet no use of tongue</p>
  <p>Many a Shrovetide here may bow</p>
  <p>To that empress I do now,</p>
  <p>That these children of these lords,</p>
  <p>Sitting at your council boards,</p>
  <p>May be grave and agÃ¨d seen</p>
  <p>Of her that was their fathers’ queen.</p>
  <p>Once I wish this wish again,</p>
  <p>Heaven subscribe it with “Amen”.</p>
