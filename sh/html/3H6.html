  <li>I wonder how the King escap’d our hands.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK.">
  <li>While we pursu’d the horsemen of the north,</li>
  <li>He slyly stole away and left his men;</li>
  <li>Whereat the great Lord of Northumberland,</li>
  <li data-number="5">Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat,</li>
  <li>Cheer’d up the drooping army, and himself,</li>
  <li>Lord Clifford, and Lord Stafford, all abreast,</li>
  <li>Charg’d our main battle’s front; and breaking in,</li>
  <li>Were by the swords of common soldiers slain.</li>

<ol data-speaker="EDW.">
  <li data-number="10">Lord Stafford’s father, Duke of Buckingham,</li>

</ol>

  <li>And, brother, here’s the Earl of Wiltshire’s blood,</li>

  <li>And so do I, victorious prince of York.</li>
  <li>Before I see thee seated in that throne</li>
  <li>Which now the house of Lancaster usurps,</li>
  <li>I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close.</li>
  <li data-number="25">This is the palace of the fearful king,</li>
  <li>And this the regal seat. Possess it, York,</li>
  <li>For this is thine and not King Henry’s heirs’.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK.">
  <li>Assist me then, sweet Warwick, and I will,</li>

  <li>Hath made us by-words to our enemies.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK.">
  <li>Then leave me not, my lords, be resolute,</li>

<ol data-speaker="K. HEN.">
  <li data-number="50">My lords, look where the sturdy rebel sits,</li>
  <li>Even in the chair of state. Belike he means,</li>
  <li>Back’d by the power of Warwick, that false peer,</li>
  <li>To aspire unto the crown and reign as king.</li>
  <li>Earl of Northumberland, he slew thy father,</li>
  <li data-number="55">And thine, Lord Clifford, and you both have vow’d revenge</li>
  <li>On him, his sons, his favorites, and his friends.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NORTH.">
  <li>If I be not, heavens be reveng’d on me!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLIF.">
  <li>The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WEST.">
  <li>What, shall we suffer this? Let’s pluck him down.</li>
  <li data-number="60">My heart for anger burns, I cannot brook it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. HEN.">
  <li>Be patient, gentle Earl of Westmorland.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLIF.">
  <li>Patience is for poltroons, such as he.</li>
  <li>He durst not sit there, had your father liv’d.</li>
  <li>My gracious lord, here in the parliament</li>
  <li data-number="65">Let us assail the family of York.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NORTH.">
  <li>Well hast thou spoken, cousin, be it so.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. HEN.">
  <li>Ah, know you not the city favors them,</li>
  <li>And they have troops of soldiers at their beck?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EXE.">
  <li>But when the Duke is slain, they’ll quickly fly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. HEN.">
  <li data-number="70">Far be the thought of this from Henry’s heart,</li>
  <li>To make a shambles of the parliament house!</li>
  <li>Cousin of Exeter, frowns, words, and threats</li>
  <li>Shall be the war that Henry means to use.</li>
  <li>Thou factious Duke of York, descend my throne,</li>
  <li>And kneel for grace and mercy at my feet:</li>
  <li>I am thy sovereign.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK.">
  <li data-offset="4">I am thine.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EXE.">
  <li>For shame, come down. He made thee Duke of York.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK.">
  <li>It was my inheritance, as the earldom was.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EXE.">
  <li>Thy father was a traitor to the crown.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WAR.">
  <li data-number="80">Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown,</li>
  <li>In following this usurping Henry.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLIF.">
  <li>Whom should he follow but his natural king?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WAR.">
  <li>True, Clifford, that’s Richard Duke of York.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. HEN.">
  <li>And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK.">
  <li data-number="85">It must and shall be so. Content thyself.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WAR.">
  <li>Be Duke of Lancaster, let him be King.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WEST.">
  <li>He is both King and Duke of Lancaster,</li>
  <li>And that the Lord of Westmorland shall maintain.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WAR.">
  <li>And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget</li>
  <li data-number="90">That we are those which chas’d you from the field,</li>
  <li>And slew your fathers, and with colors spread</li>
  <li>March’d through the city to the palace gates.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NORTH.">
  <li>Yes, Warwick, I remember it to my grief,</li>
  <li>And by his soul, thou and thy house shall rue it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WEST.">
  <li data-number="95">Plantagenet, of thee and these thy sons,</li>
  <li>Thy kinsmen and thy friends, I’ll have more lives</li>
  <li>Than drops of blood were in my father’s veins.</li>

<ol data-speaker="CLIF.">
  <li>Urge it no more, lest that, in stead of words,</li>
  <li>I send thee, Warwick, such a messenger</li>
  <li data-number="100">As shall revenge his death before I stir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WAR.">
  <li>Poor Clifford, how I scorn his worthless threats!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK.">
  <li>Will you we show our title to the crown?</li>
  <li>If not, our swords shall plead it in the field.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. HEN.">
  <li>What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?</li>
  <li data-number="105">Thy father was, as thou art, Duke of York,</li>
  <li>Thy grandfather, Roger Mortimer, Earl of March:</li>
  <li>I am the son of Henry the Fifth,</li>
  <li>Who made the Dauphin and the French to stoop,</li>
  <li>And seiz’d upon their towns and provinces.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WAR.">
  <li data-number="110">Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it all.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. HEN.">
  <li>The Lord Protector lost it, and not I;</li>
  <li>When I was crown’d I was but nine months old.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RICH.">
  <li>You are old enough now, and yet methinks you lose.</li>
  <li>Father, tear the crown from the usurper’s head.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EDW.">
  <li data-number="115">Sweet father, do so, set it on your head.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MONT.">
  <li>Good brother, as thou lov’st and honorest arms,</li>
  <li>Let’s fight it out, and not stand cavilling thus.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RICH.">
  <li>Sound drums and trumpets, and the King will fly.</li>

  <li>Sons, peace!</li>

<ol data-speaker="K. HEN.">
  <li data-number="120">Peace thou! And give King Henry leave to speak.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WAR.">
  <li>Plantagenet shall speak first. Hear him, lords,</li>
  <li>And be you silent and attentive too,</li>
  <li>For he that interrupts him shall not live.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. HEN.">
  <li>Think’st thou that I will leave my kingly throne,</li>
  <li data-number="125">Wherein my grandsire and my father sat?</li>
  <li>No; first shall war unpeople this my realm;</li>
  <li>Ay, and their colors, often borne in France,</li>
  <li>And now in England to our heart’s great sorrow,</li>
  <li>Shall be my winding-sheet. Why faint you, lords?</li>
  <li data-number="130">My title’s good, and better far than his.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WAR.">
  <li>Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be King.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. HEN.">
  <li>Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown.</li>

  <li>What then?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. HEN.">
  <li>And if he may, then am I lawful king;</li>
  <li>For Richard, in the view of many lords,</li>
  <li>Resign’d the crown to Henry the Fourth,</li>
  <li data-number="140">Whose heir my father was, and I am his.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK.">
  <li>He rose against him, being his sovereign,</li>
  <li>And made him to resign his crown perforce.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WAR.">
  <li>Suppose, my lords, he did it unconstrain’d,</li>
  <li>Think you ’twere prejudicial to his crown?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EXE.">
  <li data-number="145">No; for he could not so resign his crown</li>

  <li>Our baleful news, and at each word’s deliverance</li>
  <li>Stab poniards in our flesh till all were told,</li>
  <li>The words would add more anguish than the wounds.</li>

<ol data-speaker="EDW.">
  <li>O Warwick, Warwick, that Plantagenet,</li>
  <li>Which held thee dearly as his soul’s redemption,</li>
  <li>Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WAR.">
  <li>Ten days ago I drown’d these news in tears;</li>
  <li data-number="105">And now, to add more measure to your woes,</li>
  <li>I come to tell you things sith then befall’n.</li>
  <li>After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought,</li>
  <li>Where your brave father breath’d his latest gasp,</li>
  <li>Tidings, as swiftly as the posts could run,</li>
  <li data-number="110">Were brought me of your loss and his depart.</li>
  <li>I, then in London, keeper of the King,</li>
  <li>Muster’d my soldiers, gathered flocks of friends,</li>
  <li>And very well appointed, as I thought,</li>
  <li>March’d toward Saint Albans to intercept the Queen,</li>
  <li data-number="115">Bearing the King in my behalf along;</li>
  <li>For by my scouts I was advertised</li>
  <li>That she was coming with a full intent</li>
  <li>To dash our late decree in parliament</li>
  <li>Touching King Henry’s oath and your succession.</li>
  <li data-number="120">Short tale to make, we at Saint Albans met,</li>
  <li>Our battles join’d, and both sides fiercely fought;</li>
  <li>But whether ’twas the coldness of the King,</li>
  <li>Who look’d full gently on his warlike queen,</li>
  <li>That robb’d my soldiers of their heated spleen;</li>
  <li data-number="125">Or whether ’twas report of her success,</li>
  <li>Or more than common fear of Clifford’s rigor,</li>
  <li>Who thunders to his captives blood and death,</li>
  <li>I cannot judge: but, to conclude with truth,</li>
  <li>Their weapons like to lightning came and went;</li>
  <li data-number="130">Our soldiers’, like the night-owl’s lazy flight,</li>
  <li>Or like an idle thresher with a flail,</li>
  <li>Fell gently down, as if they struck their friends.</li>
  <li>I cheer’d them up with justice of our cause,</li>
  <li>With promise of high pay and great rewards;</li>
  <li data-number="135">But all in vain, they had no heart to fight,</li>
  <li>And we, in them, no hope to win the day,</li>
  <li>So that we fled: the King unto the Queen;</li>
  <li>Lord George your brother, Norfolk, and myself,</li>
  <li>In haste, post-haste, are come to join with you;</li>
  <li data-number="140">For in the marches here we heard you were,</li>
  <li>Making another head to fight again.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EDW.">
  <li>Where is the Duke of Norfolk, gentle Warwick?</li>
  <li>And when came George from Burgundy to England?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WAR.">
  <li>Some six miles off the Duke is with the soldiers,</li>
  <li data-number="145">And for your brother, he was lately sent</li>
  <li>From your kind aunt, Duchess of Burgundy,</li>
  <li>With aid of soldiers to this needful war.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RICH.">
  <li>’Twas odds, belike, when valiant Warwick fled:</li>
  <li>Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit,</li>
  <li data-number="150">But ne’er till now his scandal of retire.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WAR.">
  <li>Nor now my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear;</li>
  <li>For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine</li>
  <li>Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry’s head,</li>
  <li>And wring the aweful sceptre from his fist,</li>
  <li data-number="155">Were he as famous and as bold in war</li>
  <li>As he is fam’d for mildness, peace, and prayer.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RICH.">
  <li>I know it well, Lord Warwick, blame me not.</li>
  <li>’Tis love I bear thy glories make me speak.</li>
  <li>But in this troublous time what’s to be done?</li>
  <li data-number="160">Shall we go throw away our coats of steel,</li>
  <li>And wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns,</li>
  <li>Numb’ring our Ave-Maries with our beads?</li>
  <li>Or shall we on the helmets of our foes</li>
  <li>Tell our devotion with revengeful arms?</li>
  <li data-number="165">If for the last, say ay, and to it, lords.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WAR.">
  <li>Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out,</li>
  <li>And therefore comes my brother Montague.</li>
  <li>Attend me, lords: the proud insulting Queen,</li>
  <li>With Clifford and the haught Northumberland,</li>
  <li data-number="170">And of their feather many more proud birds,</li>
  <li>Have wrought the easy-melting King like wax.</li>
  <li>He swore consent to your succession,</li>
  <li>His oath enrolled in the parliament;</li>
  <li>And now to London all the crew are gone</li>
  <li data-number="175">To frustrate both his oath and what beside</li>
  <li>May make against the house of Lancaster.</li>
  <li>Their power, I think, is thirty thousand strong.</li>
  <li>Now, if the help of Norfolk and myself,</li>
  <li>With all the friends that thou, brave Earl of March,</li>
  <li data-number="180">Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure,</li>
  <li>Will but amount to five and twenty thousand,</li>
  <li>Why, <foreign xml:lang="it">via</foreign>! To London will we march,</li>
  <li>And once again bestride our foaming steeds,</li>
  <li>And once again cry “Charge!” upon our foes,</li>
  <li data-number="185">But never once again turn back and fly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RICH.">
  <li>Ay, now methinks I hear great Warwick speak.</li>
  <li>Ne’er may he live to see a sunshine day</li>
  <li>That cries “Retire!” if Warwick bid him stay.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EDW.">
  <li>Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean,</li>
  <li data-number="190">And when thou fail’st (as God forbid the hour!)</li>
  <li>Must Edward fall, which peril heaven forefend!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WAR.">
  <li>No longer Earl of March, but Duke of York;</li>
  <li>The next degree is England’s royal throne;</li>
  <li>For King of England shalt thou be proclaim’d</li>
  <li data-number="195">In every borough as we pass along,</li>
  <li>And he that throws not up his cap for joy</li>
  <li>Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head.</li>
  <li>King Edward, valiant Richard, Montague,</li>
  <li>Stay we no longer, dreaming of renown,</li>
  <li data-number="200">But sound the trumpets, and about our task.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RICH.">
  <li>Then, Clifford, were thy heart as hard as steel,</li>
  <li>As thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds,</li>

  <li>Not he that sets his foot upon her back.</li>
  <li>The smallest worm will turn, being trodden on,</li>

  <li>Ambitious York did level at thy crown,</li>
  <li data-number="20">Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows:</li>
  <li>He, but a duke, would have his son a king,</li>

  <li>And long hereafter say unto his child,</li>

  <li>My queen and son are gone to France for aid;</li>

  <li>To wife for Edward. If this news be true,</li>
  <li>Poor queen and son, your labor is but lost;</li>
  <li>For Warwick is a subtle orator,</li>

  <li data-number="35">By this account then, Margaret may win him,</li>
  <li>For she’s a woman to be pitied much.</li>
  <li>Her sighs will make a batt’ry in his breast,</li>

  <li>The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn;</li>

  <li>To hear and see her plaints, her brinish tears.</li>
  <li>Ay, but she’s come to beg; Warwick, to give:</li>
  <li>She, on his left side, craving aid for Henry;</li>
  <li>He, on his right, asking a wife for Edward.</li>
  <li data-number="45">She weeps, and says her Henry is depos’d;</li>
  <li>He smiles, and says his Edward is install’d;</li>
  <li>That she, poor wretch, for grief can speak no more;</li>
  <li>Whiles Warwick tells his title, smooths the wrong,</li>
  <li>Inferreth arguments of mighty strength,</li>
  <li data-number="50">And in conclusion wins the King from her</li>
  <li>With promise of his sister and what else,</li>
  <li>To strengthen and support King Edward’s place.</li>
  <li>O Margaret, thus ’twill be, and thou, poor soul,</li>

<ol data-speaker="K. HEN.">
  <li>My crown is in my heart, not on my head;</li>

<ol data-speaker="2. KEEP.">
  <li>Well, if you be a king crown’d with content,</li>

  <li>You are the king King Edward hath depos’d;</li>
  <li data-number="70">And we his subjects, sworn in all allegiance,</li>
  <li>Will apprehend you as his enemy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. HEN.">
  <li>But did you never swear and break an oath?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. KEEP.">
  <li>No, never such an oath, nor will not now.</li>

  <li>Where did you dwell when I was King of England?</li>

  <li>And tell me then, have you not broke your oaths?</li>

  <li>Ah, simple men, you know not what you swear!</li>
  <li>Look, as I blow this feather from my face,</li>
  <li data-number="85">And as the air blows it to me again,</li>
  <li>Obeying with my wind when I do blow,</li>
  <li>And yielding to another when it blows,</li>
  <li>Commanded always by the greater gust,</li>
  <li>Such is the lightness of you common men.</li>
  <li data-number="90">But do not break your oaths, for of that sin</li>
  <li>My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty.</li>
  <li>Go where you will, the King shall be commanded;</li>
  <li>And be you kings: command, and I’ll obey.</li>

<ol data-speaker="1. KEEP.">
  <li>We are true subjects to the King, King Edward.</li>

  <li>I told your Majesty as much before:</li>

  <li>King Lewis, I here protest in sight of heaven,</li>

  <li>No more my king, for he dishonors me,</li>
  <li data-number="185">But most himself if he could see his shame.</li>
  <li>Did I forget that by the house of York</li>
  <li>My father came untimely to his death?</li>

  <li>Did I impale him with the regal crown?</li>

  <li data-number="195">My noble queen, let former grudges pass,</li>

  <li>And force the tyrant from his seat by war.</li>

  <li>He’s very likely now to fall from him,</li>

  <li>Now, brother of Clarence, how like you our choice,</li>
  <li data-number="10">That you stand pensive as half malcontent?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAR.">
  <li>As well as Lewis of France or the Earl of Warwick,</li>
  <li>Which are so weak of courage and in judgment</li>
  <li>That they’ll take no offense at our abuse.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. EDW.">
  <li>Suppose they take offense without a cause;</li>
  <li data-number="15">They are but Lewis and Warwick, I am Edward,</li>
  <li>Your king and Warwick’s, and must have my will.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>And shall have your will, because our king.</li>
  <li>Yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. EDW.">
  <li>Yea, brother Richard, are you offended too?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li data-number="20">Not I.</li>
  <li>No; God forbid that I should wish them sever’d</li>
  <li>Whom God hath join’d together; ay, and ’twere pity</li>
  <li>To sunder them that yoke so well together.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. EDW.">
  <li>Setting your scorns and your mislike aside,</li>
  <li data-number="25">Tell me some reason why the Lady Grey</li>
  <li>Should not become my wife and England’s queen.</li>
  <li>And you too, Somerset and Montague,</li>
  <li>Speak freely what you think.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAR.">
  <li>Then this is mine opinion: that King Lewis</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>And Warwick, doing what you gave in charge,</li>
  <li>Is now dishonored by this new marriage.</li>

<ol data-speaker="K. EDW.">
  <li>What if both Lewis and Warwick be appeas’d</li>
  <li data-number="35">By such invention as I can devise?</li>

<ol data-speaker="MONT.">
  <li>Yet, to have join’d with France in such alliance</li>
  <li>Would more have strength’ned this our commonwealth</li>

<ol data-speaker="HAST.">
  <li>’Tis better using France than trusting France.</li>
  <li>Let us be back’d with God, and with the seas,</li>
  <li>Which he hath giv’n for fence impregnable,</li>

  <li>In them, and in ourselves, our safety lies.</li>

<ol data-speaker="CLAR.">

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>And yet methinks your Grace hath not done well</li>
  <li>To give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales</li>
  <li>Unto the brother of your loving bride.</li>
  <li>She better would have fitted me or Clarence;</li>
  <li data-number="55">But in your bride you bury brotherhood.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAR.">
  <li>Or else you would not have bestow’d the heir</li>

  <li>I, that have neither pity, love, nor fear.</li>
  <li>Indeed ’tis true that Henry told me of;</li>
  <li data-number="70">For I have often heard my mother say</li>
  <li>I came into the world with my legs forward.</li>
  <li>Had I not reason, think ye, to make haste,</li>
  <li>And seek their ruin that usurp’d our right?</li>
  <li>The midwife wonder’d and the women cried,</li>
  <li data-number="75">“O, Jesus bless us, he is born with teeth!”</li>
  <li>And so I was, which plainly signified</li>
  <li>That I should snarl, and bite, and play the dog.</li>
  <li>Then since the heavens have shap’d my body so,</li>
  <li>Let hell make crook’d my mind to answer it.</li>
  <li data-number="80">I have no brother, I am like no brother;</li>
  <li>And this word “love,” which greybeards call divine,</li>
  <li>Be resident in men like one another,</li>
  <li>And not in me: I am myself alone.</li>
  <li>Clarence, beware! Thou keep’st me from the light,</li>
  <li data-number="85">But I will sort a pitchy day for thee;</li>
  <li>For I will buzz abroad such prophecies</li>
  <li>That Edward shall be fearful of his life,</li>
  <li>And then to purge his fear, I’ll be thy death.</li>
  <li>King Henry and the Prince his son are gone;</li>
  <li data-number="90">Clarence, thy turn is next, and then the rest,</li>
  <li>Counting myself but bad till I be best.</li>
  <li>I’ll throw thy body in another room,</li>
  <li>And triumph, Henry, in thy day of doom.</li>

  <li>Once more we sit in England’s royal throne,</li>
  <li>Repurchas’d with the blood of enemies.</li>
  <li>What valiant foemen, like to autumn’s corn,</li>
  <li>Have we mow’d down in tops of all their pride!</li>
  <li data-number="5">Three Dukes of Somerset, threefold renown’d</li>
  <li>For hardy and undoubted champions;</li>
  <li>Two Cliffords, as the father and the son,</li>
  <li>And two Northumberlands—two braver men</li>
  <li>Ne’er spurr’d their coursers at the trumpet’s sound;</li>
  <li data-number="10">With them, the two brave bears, Warwick and Montague,</li>
  <li>That in their chains fetter’d the kingly lion,</li>
  <li>And made the forest tremble when they roar’d.</li>
  <li>Thus have we swept suspicion from our seat,</li>
  <li>And made our footstool of security.</li>
  <li data-number="15">Come hither, Bess, and let me kiss my boy.</li>
  <li>Young Ned, for thee, thine uncles and myself</li>
  <li>Have in our armors watch’d the winter’s night,</li>
  <li>Went all afoot in summer’s scalding heat,</li>
  <li>That thou mightst repossess the crown in peace,</li>
  <li data-number="20">And of our labors thou shalt reap the gain.</li>

  <li>I’ll blast his harvest, and your head were laid,</li>

  <li>This shoulder was ordain’d so thick to heave,</li>
  <li>And heave it shall some weight, or break my back:</li>
  <li data-number="25">Work thou the way—and that shall execute.</li>

  <li>Clarence and Gloucester, love my lovely queen,</li>

  <li>Away with her, and waft her hence to France.</li>
