  <li>For this relief much thanks. ’Tis bitter cold,</li>

  <li data-number="20">Welcome, Horatio, welcome, good Marcellus.</li>

  <li>What, has this thing appear’d again tonight?</li>

<ol data-speaker="BAR.">
  <li>I have seen nothing.</li>

<ol data-speaker="MAR.">
  <li>Horatio says ’tis but our fantasy,</li>
  <li>And will not let belief take hold of him</li>
  <li data-number="25">Touching this dreaded sight twice seen of us;</li>
  <li>Therefore I have entreated him along,</li>
  <li>With us to watch the minutes of this night,</li>
  <li>That if again this apparition come,</li>
  <li>He may approve our eyes and speak to it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOR.">
  <li data-number="30">Tush, tush, ’twill not appear.</li>

<ol data-speaker="BAR.">
  <li>Sit down a while,</li>
  <li>And let us once again assail your ears,</li>
  <li>That are so fortified against our story,</li>
  <li>What we have two nights seen.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOR.">
  <li data-offset="6">Well, sit we down,</li>
  <li data-number="35">And let us hear Barnardo speak of this.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAR.">
  <li>Last night of all,</li>
  <li>When yond same star that’s westward from the pole</li>
  <li>Had made his course t’ illume that part of heaven</li>
  <li>Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,</li>

  <li>Peace, break thee off! Look where it comes again!</li>

<ol data-speaker="BAR.">
  <li>In the same figure like the King that’s dead.</li>

<ol data-speaker="MAR.">
  <li>Thou art a scholar, speak to it, Horatio.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAR.">
  <li>Looks ’a not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOR.">
  <li>Most like; it harrows me with fear and wonder.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAR.">
  <li>It would be spoke to.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MAR.">
  <li data-offset="4">Speak to it, Horatio.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOR.">
  <li>What art thou that usurp’st this time of night,</li>
  <li>Together with that fair and warlike form</li>
  <li>In which the majesty of buried Denmark</li>
  <li>Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MAR.">
  <li>It is offended.</li>

  <li>How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale.</li>
  <li data-number="55">Is not this something more than fantasy?</li>
  <li>What think you on’t?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOR.">
  <li>Before my God, I might not this believe</li>
  <li>Without the sensible and true avouch</li>
  <li>Of mine own eyes.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MAR.">
  <li data-offset="4">Is it not like the King?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOR.">
  <li data-number="60">As thou art to thyself.</li>
  <li>Such was the very armor he had on</li>
  <li>When he the ambitious Norway combated.</li>
  <li>So frown’d he once when in an angry parle</li>
  <li>He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.</li>
  <li data-number="65">’Tis strange.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MAR.">
  <li>Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,</li>
  <li>With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOR.">
  <li>In what particular thought to work I know not,</li>
  <li>But in the gross and scope of mine opinion,</li>
  <li data-number="70">This bodes some strange eruption to our state.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MAR.">
  <li>Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,</li>
  <li>Why this same strict and most observant watch</li>
  <li>So nightly toils the subject of the land,</li>
  <li>And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,</li>
  <li data-number="75">And foreign mart for implements of war,</li>
  <li>Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task</li>
  <li>Does not divide the Sunday from the week,</li>
  <li>What might be toward, that this sweaty haste</li>
  <li>Doth make the night joint-laborer with the day:</li>
  <li>Who is’t that can inform me?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOR.">
  <li data-number="80" data-offset="6">That can I,</li>
  <li>At least the whisper goes so: our last king,</li>
  <li>Whose image even but now appear’d to us,</li>
  <li>Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,</li>
  <li>Thereto prick’d on by a most emulate pride,</li>
  <li data-number="85">Dar’d to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet</li>
  <li>(For so this side of our known world esteem’d him)</li>
  <li>Did slay this Fortinbras, who, by a seal’d compact</li>
  <li>Well ratified by law and heraldy,</li>
  <li>Did forfeit (with his life) all those his lands</li>
  <li data-number="90">Which he stood seiz’d of, to the conqueror;</li>
  <li>Against the which a moi’ty competent</li>
  <li>Was gaged by our king, which had return’d</li>
  <li>To the inheritance of Fortinbras,</li>
  <li>Had he been vanquisher; as by the same comart</li>
  <li data-number="95">And carriage of the article design’d,</li>
  <li>His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,</li>
  <li>Of unimproved mettle hot and full,</li>
  <li>Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there</li>
  <li>Shark’d up a list of lawless resolutes</li>
  <li data-number="100">For food and diet to some enterprise</li>
  <li>That hath a stomach in’t, which is no other,</li>
  <li>As it doth well appear unto our state,</li>
  <li>But to recover of us, by strong hand</li>
  <li>And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands</li>
  <li data-number="105">So by his father lost; and this, I take it,</li>
  <li>Is the main motive of our preparations,</li>
  <li>The source of this our watch, and the chief head</li>
  <li>Of this post-haste and romage in the land.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAR.">
  <li>I think it be no other but e’en so.</li>
  <li data-number="110">Well may it sort that this portentous figure</li>
  <li>Comes armed through our watch so like the King</li>
  <li>That was and is the question of these wars.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOR.">
  <li>A mote it is to trouble the mind’s eye.</li>
  <li>In the most high and palmy state of Rome,</li>
  <li data-number="115">A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,</li>
  <li>The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead</li>
  <li>Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets.</li>
  <li>As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood,</li>
  <li>Disasters in the sun; and the moist star</li>
  <li data-number="120">Upon whose influence Neptune’s empire stands</li>
  <li>Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.</li>
  <li>And even the like precurse of fear’d events,</li>
  <li>As harbingers preceding still the fates</li>
  <li>And prologue to the omen coming on,</li>
  <li data-number="125">Have heaven and earth together demonstrated</li>
  <li>Unto our climatures and countrymen.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">
					Enter Ghost.
					
						GHOST.
					
				</li>
  <li>But soft, behold! Lo where it comes again!</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">
					It spreads his arms.
					
						GHOST.
					
				</li>
  <li>I’ll cross it though it blast me. Stay, illusion!</li>
  <li>If thou hast any sound or use of voice,</li>
  <li data-number="130">Speak to me.</li>
  <li>If there be any good thing to be done</li>
  <li>That may to thee do ease, and grace to me,</li>
  <li>Speak to me.</li>
  <li>If thou art privy to thy country’s fate,</li>
  <li data-number="135">Which happily foreknowing may avoid,</li>
  <li>O speak!</li>
  <li>Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life</li>
  <li>Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,</li>
  <li>For which, they say, your spirits oft walk in death,</li>
  <li data-number="140">Speak of it, stay and speak!</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">
					The cock crows.
					
					
				</li>
  <li>Stop it, Marcellus.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MAR.">
  <li>Shall I strike it with my partisan?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOR.">
  <li>Do, if it will not stand.</li>

				</li>
  <li data-number="145">We do it wrong, being so majestical,</li>
  <li>To offer it the show of violence,</li>
  <li>For it is as the air, invulnerable,</li>
  <li>And our vain blows malicious mockery.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAR.">
  <li>It was about to speak when the cock crew.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOR.">
  <li data-number="150">And then it started like a guilty thing</li>
  <li>Upon a fearful summons. I have heard</li>
  <li>The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,</li>
  <li>Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat</li>
  <li>Awake the god of day, and at his warning,</li>
  <li data-number="155">Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,</li>
  <li>Th’ extravagant and erring spirit hies</li>
  <li>To his confine; and of the truth herein</li>
  <li>This present object made probation.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MAR.">
  <li>It faded on the crowing of the cock.</li>
  <li data-number="160">Some say that ever ’gainst that season comes</li>
  <li>Wherein our Saviour’s birth is celebrated,</li>
  <li>This bird of dawning singeth all night long,</li>
  <li>And then they say no spirit dare stir abroad,</li>
  <li>The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,</li>
  <li data-number="165">No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,</li>
  <li>So hallowed, and so gracious, is that time.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOR.">
  <li>So have I heard and do in part believe it.</li>
  <li>But look, the morn in russet mantle clad</li>
  <li>Walks o’er the dew of yon high eastward hill.</li>
  <li data-number="170">Break we our watch up, and by my advice</li>
  <li>Let us impart what we have seen tonight</li>
  <li>Unto young Hamlet, for, upon my life,</li>
  <li>This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.</li>
  <li>Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,</li>
  <li data-number="175">As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?</li>

<ol data-speaker="KING.">
  <li>Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother’s death</li>
  <li>The memory be green, and that it us befitted</li>
  <li>To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom</li>
  <li>To be contracted in one brow of woe,</li>
  <li data-number="5">Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature</li>
  <li>That we with wisest sorrow think on him</li>
  <li>Together with remembrance of ourselves.</li>
  <li>Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,</li>
  <li>Th’ imperial jointress to this warlike state,</li>
  <li data-number="10">Have we, as ’twere with a defeated joy,</li>
  <li>With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,</li>
  <li>With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,</li>
  <li>In equal scale weighing delight and dole,</li>
  <li>Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr’d</li>
  <li data-number="15">Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone</li>
  <li>With this affair along. For all, our thanks.</li>
  <li>Now follows that you know young Fortinbras,</li>
  <li>Holding a weak supposal of our worth,</li>
  <li>Or thinking by our late dear brother’s death</li>
  <li data-number="20">Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,</li>
  <li>Co-leagued with this dream of his advantage,</li>
  <li>He hath not fail’d to pester us with message</li>
  <li>Importing the surrender of those lands</li>
  <li>Lost by his father, with all bands of law,</li>
  <li data-number="25">To our most valiant brother. So much for him.</li>
  <li>Now for ourself, and for this time of meeting,</li>
  <li>Thus much the business is: we have here writ</li>
  <li>To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras—</li>
  <li>Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears</li>
  <li data-number="30">Of this his nephew’s purpose—to suppress</li>
  <li>His further gait herein, in that the levies,</li>
  <li>The lists, and full proportions are all made</li>
  <li>Out of his subject; and we here dispatch</li>
  <li>You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,</li>
  <li data-number="35">For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,</li>
  <li>Giving to you no further personal power</li>

  <li>And now, Laertes, what’s the news with you?</li>
  <li>You told us of some suit, what is’t, Laertes?</li>
  <li>You cannot speak of reason to the Dane</li>
  <li data-number="45">And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,</li>
  <li>That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?</li>
  <li>The head is not more native to the heart,</li>

  <li data-number="50" data-offset="7">My dread lord,</li>
  <li>Your leave and favor to return to France,</li>

  <li>Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted color off,</li>

  <li>Ay, madam, it is common.</li>

  <li data-offset="6">If it be,</li>

<ol data-speaker="HAM.">
  <li>Seems, madam? Nay, it is, I know not “seems.”</li>
  <li>’Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,</li>
  <li>Nor customary suits of solemn black,</li>
  <li>Nor windy suspiration of forc’d breath,</li>
  <li data-number="80">No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,</li>
  <li>Nor the dejected havior of the visage,</li>
  <li>Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,</li>
  <li>That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,</li>
  <li>For they are actions that a man might play,</li>
  <li data-number="85">But I have that within which passes show,</li>
  <li>These but the trappings and the suits of woe.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING.">
  <li>’Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,</li>
  <li>To give these mourning duties to your father.</li>
  <li>But you must know your father lost a father,</li>
  <li data-number="90">That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound</li>
  <li>In filial obligation for some term</li>
  <li>To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever</li>
  <li>In obstinate condolement is a course</li>
  <li>Of impious stubbornness, ’tis unmanly grief,</li>
  <li data-number="95">It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,</li>
  <li>A heart unfortified, or mind impatient,</li>
  <li>An understanding simple and unschool’d:</li>
  <li>For what we know must be, and is as common</li>
  <li>As any the most vulgar thing to sense,</li>
  <li data-number="100">Why should we in our peevish opposition</li>
  <li>Take it to heart? Fie, ’tis a fault to heaven,</li>
  <li>A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,</li>
  <li>To reason most absurd, whose common theme</li>
  <li>Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,</li>
  <li data-number="105">From the first corse till he that died today,</li>
  <li>“This must be so.” We pray you throw to earth</li>
  <li>This unprevailing woe, and think of us</li>
  <li>As of a father, for let the world take note</li>
  <li>You are the most immediate to our throne,</li>
  <li data-number="110">And with no less nobility of love</li>
  <li>Than that which dearest father bears his son</li>
  <li>Do I impart toward you. For your intent</li>
  <li>In going back to school in Wittenberg,</li>
  <li>It is most retrograde to our desire,</li>
  <li data-number="115">And we beseech you bend you to remain</li>
  <li>Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,</li>
  <li>Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN.">
  <li>Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet,</li>
  <li>I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.</li>

  <li data-number="120">I shall in all my best obey you, madam.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING.">
  <li>Why, ’tis a loving and a fair reply.</li>
  <li>Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come.</li>
  <li>This gentle and unforc’d accord of Hamlet</li>
  <li>Sits smiling to my heart, in grace whereof,</li>
  <li data-number="125">No jocund health that Denmark drinks today,</li>

  <li>A little month, or ere those shoes were old</li>
  <li>With which she followed my poor father’s body,</li>
  <li>Like Niobe, all tears—why, she, even she—</li>
  <li data-number="150">O God, a beast that wants discourse of reason</li>
  <li>Would have mourn’d longer—married with my uncle,</li>

  <li>A violet in the youth of primy nature,</li>
  <li>Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,</li>
  <li>The perfume and suppliance of a minute—</li>
  <li>No more.</li>

  <li data-offset="2">No more but so?</li>

  <li data-number="10" data-offset="5">Think it no more:</li>
  <li>For nature crescent does not grow alone</li>
  <li>In thews and bulk, but as this temple waxes,</li>
  <li>The inward service of the mind and soul</li>
  <li>Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,</li>
  <li data-number="15">And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch</li>
  <li>The virtue of his will, but you must fear,</li>
  <li>His greatness weigh’d, his will is not his own,</li>
  <li>For he himself is subject to his birth:</li>
  <li>He may not, as unvalued persons do,</li>
  <li data-number="20">Carve for himself, for on his choice depends</li>
  <li>The safety and health of this whole state,</li>
  <li>And therefore must his choice be circumscrib’d</li>
  <li>Unto the voice and yielding of that body</li>
  <li>Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,</li>
  <li data-number="25">It fits your wisdom so far to believe it</li>
  <li>As he in his particular act and place</li>
  <li>May give his saying deed, which is no further</li>
  <li>Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.</li>
  <li>Then weigh what loss your honor may sustain</li>
  <li data-number="30">If with too credent ear you list his songs,</li>
  <li>Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open</li>
  <li>To his unmast’red importunity.</li>
  <li>Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,</li>
  <li>And keep you in the rear of your affection,</li>
  <li data-number="35">Out of the shot and danger of desire.</li>
  <li>The chariest maid is prodigal enough</li>
  <li>If she unmask her beauty to the moon.</li>
  <li>Virtue itself scapes not calumnious strokes.</li>
  <li>The canker galls the infants of the spring</li>
  <li data-number="40">Too oft before their buttons be disclos’d,</li>
  <li>And in the morn and liquid dew of youth</li>
  <li>Contagious blastments are most imminent.</li>

  <li>Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,</li>
  <li>But not express’d in fancy, rich, not gaudy,</li>
  <li>For the apparel oft proclaims the man,</li>
  <li data-number="75">And they in France of the best rank and station</li>
  <li>Are of a most select and generous chief in that.</li>
  <li>Neither a borrower nor a lender be,</li>

  <li>Marry, I will teach you: think yourself a baby</li>

  <li>Be something scanter of your maiden presence,</li>
  <li>Set your entreatments at a higher rate</li>
  <li data-number="125">Than a command to parle. For Lord Hamlet,</li>
  <li>Believe so much in him, that he is young,</li>
  <li>And with a larger teder may he walk</li>
  <li>Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,</li>
  <li>Do not believe his vows, for they are brokers,</li>
  <li data-number="130">Not of that dye which their investments show,</li>
  <li>But mere implorators of unholy suits,</li>
  <li>Breathing like sanctified and pious bonds,</li>
  <li>The better to beguile. This is for all:</li>
  <li>I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth</li>
  <li data-number="135">Have you so slander any moment leisure</li>
  <li>As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.</li>
  <li>Look to’t, I charge you. Come your ways.</li>

  <li>That it went hand in hand even with the vow</li>
  <li data-number="50">I made to her in marriage, and to decline</li>

  <li data-number="65">Holds such an enmity with blood of man</li>
  <li>That swift as quicksilver it courses through</li>

  <li>And curd, like eager droppings into milk,</li>

<ol data-speaker="REY.">

  <li>Wherefore should you do this?</li>

  <li data-offset="6">Ay, my lord,</li>

<ol data-speaker="POL.">
  <li data-offset="4">Marry, sir, here’s my drift,</li>

  <li>You laying these slight sallies on my son,</li>
  <li data-number="40">As ’twere a thing a little soil’d wi’ th’ working,</li>
  <li>Mark you,</li>
  <li>Your party in converse, him you would sound,</li>
  <li>Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes</li>
  <li>The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur’d</li>
  <li data-number="45">He closes with you in this consequence:</li>
  <li>“Good sir,” or so, or “friend,” or “gentleman,”</li>
  <li>According to the phrase or the addition</li>
  <li>Of man and country.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="REY.">
  <li data-offset="4">Very good, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POL.">
  <li>And then, sir, does ’a this—’a does—what was I</li>
  <li data-number="50">About to say?</li>
  <li>By the mass, I was about to say something.</li>
  <li>Where did I leave?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="REY.">
  <li data-offset="5">At “closes in the consequence.“</li>

<ol data-speaker="POL.">
  <li>At “closes in the consequence,” ay, marry.</li>
  <li>He closes thus: “I know the gentleman.</li>
  <li data-number="55">I saw him yesterday, or th’ other day,</li>
  <li>Or then, or then, with such or such, and as you say,</li>
  <li>There was ’a gaming, there o’ertook in ’s rouse,</li>
  <li>There falling out at tennis”; or, perchance,</li>
  <li>“I saw him enter such a house of sale,”</li>
  <li data-number="60"><foreign xml:lang="la">Videlicet</foreign>, a brothel, or so forth. See you now,</li>
  <li>Your bait of falsehood take this carp of truth,</li>
  <li>And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,</li>
  <li>With windlasses and with assays of bias,</li>
  <li>By indirections find directions out;</li>
  <li data-number="65">So by my former lecture and advice</li>

<ol data-speaker="OPH.">
  <li>My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,</li>

<ol data-speaker="OPH.">
  <li>He took me by the wrist, and held me hard,</li>
  <li>Then goes he to the length of all his arm,</li>
  <li>And with his other hand thus o’er his brow,</li>
  <li>He falls to such perusal of my face</li>
  <li data-number="90">As ’a would draw it. Long stay’d he so.</li>
  <li>At last, a little shaking of mine arm,</li>
  <li>And thrice his head thus waving up and down,</li>
  <li>He rais’d a sigh so piteous and profound</li>
  <li>As it did seem to shatter all his bulk</li>
  <li data-number="95">And end his being. That done, he lets me go,</li>
  <li>And with his head over his shoulder turn’d,</li>
  <li>He seem’d to find his way without his eyes,</li>
  <li>For out a’ doors he went without their helps,</li>
  <li>And to the last bended their light on me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POL.">
  <li data-number="100">Come, go with me. I will go seek the king.</li>
  <li>This is the very ecstasy of love,</li>
  <li>Whose violent property fordoes itself,</li>
  <li>And leads the will to desperate undertakings</li>
  <li>As oft as any passions under heaven</li>
  <li data-number="105">That does afflict our natures. I am sorry—</li>
  <li>What, have you given him any hard words of late?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OPH.">
  <li>No, my good lord, but as you did command</li>
  <li>I did repel his letters, and denied</li>
  <li>His access to me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POL.">
  <li data-offset="4">That hath made him mad.</li>
  <li data-number="110">I am sorry that with better heed and judgment</li>
  <li>I had not coted him. I fear’d he did but trifle</li>
  <li>And meant to wrack thee, but beshrew my jealousy!</li>
  <li>By heaven, it is as proper to our age</li>
  <li>To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions,</li>
  <li data-number="115">As it is common for the younger sort</li>
  <li>To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king.</li>
  <li>This must be known, which, being kept close, might move</li>

<ol data-speaker="HAM.">
  <li data-number="230">I will tell you why, so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no feather. I have of late—but wherefore I know not—lost all my mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition, that this goodly frame, the earth, seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave o’erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden fire, why, it appeareth nothing to me but a foul and pestilent congregation of vapors. What a piece of work is a man, how noble in reason, how infinite in faculties, in form and moving, how express and admirable in action, how like an angel in apprehension, how like a god! The beauty of the world; the paragon of animals; and yet to me what is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me—nor women neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROS.">
  <li>My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.</li>

<ol data-speaker="HAM.">
  <li>Why did ye laugh then, when I said, “Man delights not me”?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROS.">
  <li>To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you. We coted them on the way, and hither are they coming to offer you service.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAM.">
  <li>He that plays the king shall be welcome—his Majesty shall have tribute on me, the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target, the lover shall not sigh gratis, the humorous man shall end his part in peace, the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle a’ th’ sere, and the lady shall say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt for’t. What players are they?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROS.">
  <li data-number="235">Even those you were wont to take such delight in, the tragedians of the city.</li>

<ol data-speaker="HAM.">
  <li>How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in reputation and profit, was better both ways.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROS.">
  <li>I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAM.">
  <li>Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the city? Are they so follow’d?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROS.">
  <li>No indeed are they not.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAM.">
  <li data-number="240">How comes it? Do they grow rusty?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROS.">
  <li>Ay, their endeavor keeps in the wonted pace; but there is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top of question, and are most tyrannically clapp’d for’t. These are now the fashion, and so berattle the common stages—so they call them—that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose-quills and dare scarce come thither.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAM.">
  <li>What, are they children? Who maintains ’em? How are they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing? Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common players (as it is most like, if their means are no better), their writers do them wrong, to make them exclaim against their own succession?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROS.">
  <li>Faith, there has been much to do on both sides, and the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy. There was for a while no money bid for argument, unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAM.">
  <li>Is’t possible?</li>

<ol data-speaker="GUIL.">
  <li data-number="245">O, there has been much throwing about of brains.</li>

<ol data-speaker="ROS.">
  <li>Ay, that they do, my lord—Hercules and his load too.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAM.">
  <li>It is not very strange, for my uncle is King of Denmark, and those that would make mouths at him while my father liv’d, give twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little. ’Sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if philosophy could find it out.</li>

  <li>You are welcome, masters, welcome all. I am glad to see thee well. Welcome, good friends. O, old friend! Why, thy face is valanc’d since I saw thee last; com’st thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young lady and mistress! By’ lady, your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the altitude of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like a piece of uncurrent gold, be not crack’d within the ring. Masters, you are all welcome. We’ll e’en to’t like French falc’ners—fly at any thing we see; we’ll have a speech straight. Come give us a taste of your quality, come, a passionate speech.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. PLAY.">
  <li data-number="280">What speech, my good lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAM.">
  <li>I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted, or if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember, pleas’d not the million, ’twas caviary to the general, but it was—as I receiv’d it, and others, whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine—an excellent play, well digested in the scenes, set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savory, nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of affection, but call’d it an honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech in’t I chiefly lov’d, ’twas Aeneas’ tale to Dido, and thereabout of it especially when he speaks of Priam’s slaughter. If it live in your memory, begin at this line—let me see, let me see:</li>
  <li>“The rugged Pyrrhus, like th’ Hyrcanian beast—”</li>
  <li>’Tis not so, it begins with Pyrrhus:</li>
  <li>“The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,</li>
  <li data-number="285">Black as his purpose, did the night resemble</li>
  <li>When he lay couched in th’ ominous horse,</li>
  <li>Hath now this dread and black complexion smear’d</li>
  <li>With heraldry more dismal: head to foot</li>
  <li>Now is he total gules, horridly trick’d</li>
  <li data-number="290">With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,</li>
  <li>Bak’d and impasted with the parching streets,</li>
  <li>That lend a tyrannous and a damned light</li>
  <li>To their lord’s murder. Roasted in wrath and fire,</li>
  <li>And thus o’er-sized with coagulate gore,</li>
  <li data-number="295">With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus</li>
  <li>Old grandsire Priam seeks.”</li>
  <li>So proceed you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POL.">
  <li>’Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good discretion.</li>

<ol data-speaker="1. PLAY.">
  <li>“Anon he finds him</li>
  <li data-number="300">Striking too short at Greeks. His antique sword,</li>
  <li>Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,</li>
  <li>Repugnant to command. Unequal match’d,</li>
  <li>Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide,</li>
  <li>But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword</li>
  <li data-number="305">Th’ unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,</li>
  <li>Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top</li>
  <li>Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash</li>
  <li>Takes prisoner Pyrrhus’ ear; for lo his sword,</li>
  <li>Which was declining on the milky head</li>
  <li data-number="310">Of reverent Priam, seem’d i’ th’ air to stick.</li>
  <li>So as a painted tyrant Pyrrhus stood</li>
  <li>And, like a neutral to his will and matter,</li>
  <li>Did nothing.</li>
  <li>But as we often see, against some storm,</li>
  <li data-number="315">A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,</li>
  <li>The bold winds speechless, and the orb below</li>
  <li>As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder</li>
  <li>Doth rend the region; so after Pyrrhus’ pause,</li>
  <li>A roused vengeance sets him new a-work,</li>
  <li data-number="320">And never did the Cyclops’ hammers fall</li>
  <li>On Mars’s armor forg’d for proof eterne</li>
  <li>With less remorse than Pyrrhus’ bleeding sword</li>
  <li>Now falls on Priam.</li>
  <li>Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods,</li>
  <li data-number="325">In general synod take away her power!</li>

  <li>With most miraculous organ. I’ll have these players</li>
  <li>Play something like the murder of my father</li>
  <li>Before mine uncle. I’ll observe his looks,</li>
  <li>I’ll tent him to the quick. If ’a do blench,</li>
  <li data-number="410">I know my course. The spirit that I have seen</li>
  <li>May be a dev’l, and the dev’l hath power</li>

  <li>Out of my weakness and my melancholy,</li>
  <li>As he is very potent with such spirits,</li>
  <li data-number="415">Abuses me to damn me. I’ll have grounds</li>

  <li>Wherein I’ll catch the conscience of the king.</li>

  <li>To be, or not to be, that is the question:</li>
  <li>Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer</li>
  <li>The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,</li>
  <li>Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,</li>
  <li data-number="60">And by opposing, end them. To die, to sleep—</li>
  <li>No more, and by a sleep to say we end</li>
  <li>The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks</li>
  <li>That flesh is heir to; ’tis a consummation</li>
  <li>Devoutly to be wish’d. To die, to sleep—</li>
  <li data-number="65">To sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there’s the rub,</li>
  <li>For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,</li>
  <li>When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,</li>
  <li>Must give us pause; there’s the respect</li>
  <li>That makes calamity of so long life:</li>
  <li data-number="70">For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,</li>
  <li>Th’ oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely,</li>
  <li>The pangs of despis’d love, the law’s delay,</li>
  <li>The insolence of office, and the spurns</li>
  <li>That patient merit of th’ unworthy takes,</li>
  <li data-number="75">When he himself might his quietus make</li>
  <li>With a bare bodkin; who would fardels bear,</li>
  <li>To grunt and sweat under a weary life,</li>
  <li>But that the dread of something after death,</li>
  <li>The undiscover’d country, from whose bourn</li>
  <li data-number="80">No traveler returns, puzzles the will,</li>
  <li>And makes us rather bear those ills we have,</li>
  <li>Than fly to others that we know not of?</li>
  <li>Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,</li>
  <li>And thus the native hue of resolution</li>
  <li data-number="85">Is sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought,</li>
  <li>And enterprises of great pitch and moment</li>
  <li>With this regard their currents turn awry,</li>
  <li>And lose the name of action.—Soft you now,</li>

  <li>Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAM.">
  <li>Ay, truly, for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness. This was sometime a paradox, but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.</li>

  <li>Get thee to a nunn’ry, why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest, but yet I could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me: I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offenses at my beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give them shape, or time to act them in.

<h4>Elsinore. A hall in Elsinore castle.</h4>

<ol data-speaker="HAM.">
  <li>Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounc’d it to you,
					trippingly on the tongue, but if you mouth it, as many of our players do, I had as lief the town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently, for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say, whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear apassion to totters, to very rags, to spleet the ears of the groundlings, who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise. I would have such a fellow whipt for o’erdoing Termagant, it out-Herods Herod, pray you avoid it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. PLAY.">
  <li>I warrant your honor.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAM.">
  <li>Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion be your tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action, with this special observance, that you o’erstep not the modesty of nature: for any thing so o’erdone is from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold as ’twere the mirror up to nature: to show virtue her feature, scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone, or come tardy off, though it makes the unskillful laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the censure of which one must in your allowance o’erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I have seen play—and heard others praise, and that highly—not to speak it profanely, that, neither having th’ accent of Christians nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so strutted and bellow’d that I have thought some of Nature’s journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they imitated humanity so abominably.</li>

<ol data-speaker="1. PLAY.">
  <li>I hope we have reform’d that indifferently with us, sir.</li>

<ol data-speaker="HAM.">
  <li data-number="5">O, reform it altogether. And let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them, for there be of them that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too, though in the mean time some necessary question of the play be then to be consider’d. That’s villainous, and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. Go make you ready.</li>

					Dumb show follows. Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly, the Queen embracing him and he her. She kneels and makes show of protestation unto him. He takes her up and declines his head upon her neck. He lies him down upon a bank of flowers. She, seeing him asleep, leaves him. Anon come in another man, takes off his crown, kisses it, pours poison in the sleeper’s ears, and leaves him. The Queen returns, finds the King dead, makes passionate action. The pois’ner with some three or four mutes come in again, seem to condole with her. The dead body is carried away. The pois’ner woos the Queen with gifts; she seems harsh and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts love.

  <li>O, my offense is rank, it smells to heaven,</li>

  <li>My fault is past, but, O, what form of prayer</li>

  <li>That cannot be, since I am still possess’d</li>
  <li>Of those effects for which I did the murder:</li>

  <li>May one be pardon’d and retain th’ offense?</li>

  <li>Nor sense to ecstasy was ne’er so thrall’d</li>

  <li>Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,</li>

  <li>Could not so mope. O shame, where is thy blush?</li>
  <li>Rebellious hell,</li>
  <li>If thou canst mutine in a matron’s bones,</li>
  <li>To flaming youth let virtue be as wax</li>
  <li data-number="85">And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame</li>

  <li>So much for this, sir, now shall you see the other—</li>

  <li>Remember it, my lord!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAM.">
  <li>Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting</li>
  <li data-number="5">That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay</li>
  <li>Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly—</li>
  <li>And prais’d be rashness for it—let us know</li>
  <li>Our indiscretion sometime serves us well</li>
  <li>When our deep plots do pall, and that should learn us</li>
  <li>There’s a divinity that shapes our ends,</li>
  <li>Rough-hew them how we will—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOR.">
  <li data-offset="6">That is most certain.</li>

<ol data-speaker="HAM.">
  <li>Up from my cabin,</li>
  <li>My sea-gown scarf’d about me, in the dark</li>
  <li>Grop’d I to find out them, had my desire,</li>
  <li data-number="15">Finger’d their packet, and in fine withdrew</li>
  <li>To mine own room again, making so bold,</li>
  <li>My fears forgetting manners, to unseal</li>
  <li>Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio—</li>
  <li>Ah, royal knavery!—an exact command,</li>
  <li data-number="20">Larded with many several sorts of reasons,</li>
  <li>Importing Denmark’s health and England’s too,</li>
  <li>With, ho, such bugs and goblins in my life,</li>
  <li>That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,</li>
  <li>No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,</li>

  <li>I beseech you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAM.">
  <li>Being thus benetted round with villainies,</li>
  <li data-number="30">Or I could make a prologue to my brains,</li>
  <li>They had begun the play. I sat me down,</li>
  <li>Devis’d a new commission, wrote it fair.</li>
  <li>I once did hold it, as our statists do,</li>
  <li>A baseness to write fair, and labor’d much</li>
  <li data-number="35">How to forget that learning, but, sir, now</li>
  <li>It did me yeman’s service. Wilt thou know</li>
  <li>Th’ effect of what I wrote?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOR.">
  <li data-offset="6">Ay, good my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAM.">
  <li>An earnest conjuration from the King,</li>
  <li>As England was his faithful tributary,</li>
  <li data-number="40">As love between them like the palm might flourish,</li>
  <li>As peace should still her wheaten garland wear</li>
  <li>And stand a comma ’tween their amities,</li>
  <li>And many such-like as’s of great charge,</li>
  <li>That on the view and knowing of these contents,</li>
  <li data-number="45">Without debatement further, more or less,</li>
  <li>He should those bearers put to sudden death,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOR.">
  <li data-offset="6">How was this seal’d?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAM.">
  <li>Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.</li>
  <li>I had my father’s signet in my purse,</li>
  <li data-number="50">Which was the model of that Danish seal;</li>
  <li>Folded the writ up in the form of th’ other,</li>
  <li>Subscrib’d it, gave’t th’ impression, plac’d it safely,</li>
  <li>The changeling never known. Now the next day</li>
  <li>Was our sea-fight, and what to this was sequent</li>
  <li data-number="55">Thou knowest already.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOR.">
  <li>So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to’t.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAM.">
  <li>Why, man, they did make love to this employment,</li>
  <li>They are not near my conscience. Their defeat</li>
  <li>Does by their own insinuation grow.</li>
  <li data-number="60">’Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes</li>
  <li>Between the pass and fell incensed points</li>
  <li>Of mighty opposites.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOR.">
  <li data-offset="4">Why, what a king is this!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAM.">
  <li>Does it not, think thee, stand me now upon—</li>
  <li>He that hath kill’d my king and whor’d my mother,</li>
  <li data-number="65">Popp’d in between th’ election and my hopes,</li>
  <li>Thrown out his angle for my proper life,</li>
  <li>And with such coz’nage—is’t not perfect conscience</li>
  <li>To quit him with this arm? And is’t not to be damn’d,</li>
  <li>To let this canker of our nature come</li>
  <li data-number="70">In further evil?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOR.">
  <li>It must be shortly known to him from England</li>
  <li>What is the issue of the business there.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAM.">
  <li>It will be short; the interim’s mine,</li>
  <li>And a man’s life’s no more than to say “one.”</li>
  <li data-number="75">But I am very sorry, good Horatio,</li>
  <li>That to Laertes I forgot myself,</li>
  <li>For by the image of my cause I see</li>
  <li>The portraiture of his. I’ll court his favors.</li>
  <li>But sure the bravery of his grief did put me</li>

<ol data-speaker="OSR.">
  <li>Exceedingly, my lord, it is very sultry—as ’twere—I cannot tell how. My lord, his Majesty bade me signify to you that ’a has laid a great wager on your head. Sir, this is the matter—</li>

				</div>

<ol data-speaker="OSR.">
  <li>Nay, good my lord, for my ease, in good faith. Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes, believe me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent differences, of very soft society, and great showing; indeed, to speak sellingly of him, he is the card or calendar of gentry; for you shall find in him the continent of what part a gentleman would see.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAM.">
  <li>Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you, though I know to divide him inventorially would dozy th’ arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail; but in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of great article, and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to make true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror, and who else would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OSR.">
  <li data-number="95">Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAM.">
  <li>The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OSR.">
  <li>Sir?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOR.">
  <li>Is’t not possible to understand in another tongue? You will to’t, sir, really.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAM.">
  <li>What imports the nomination of this gentleman?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OSR.">
  <li data-number="100">Of Laertes?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOR.">
  <li>His purse is empty already: all ’s golden words are spent.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAM.">
  <li>Of him, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OSR.">
  <li>I know you are not ignorant—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAM.">
  <li>I would you did, sir, yet, in faith, if you did, it would not much approve me. Well, sir?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OSR.">
  <li data-number="105">You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAM.">
  <li>I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in excellence, but to know a man well were to know himself.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OSR.">
  <li>I mean, sir, for his weapon, but in the imputation laid on him by them, in his meed he’s unfellow’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAM.">
  <li>What’s his weapon?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OSR.">
  <li>Rapier and dagger.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAM.">
  <li data-number="110">That’s two of his weapons—but well.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OSR.">
  <li>The King, sir, hath wager’d with him six Barbary horses, against the which he has impawn’d, as I take it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so. Three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of very liberal conceit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAM.">
  <li>What call you the carriages?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOR.">
  <li>I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OSR.">
  <li>The carriages, sir, are the hangers.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAM.">
  <li data-number="115">The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could carry a cannon by our sides; I would it might be hangers till then. But on: six Barb’ry horses against six French swords, their assigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages; that’s the French bet against the Danish. Why is this all impawn’d, as you call it?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OSR.">
  <li>The King, sir, hath laid, sir, that in a dozen passes between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you three hits; he hath laid on twelve for nine; and it would come to immediate trial, if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAM.">
  <li>How if I answer no?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OSR.">
  <li>I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAM.">
  <li>Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his Majesty, it is the breathing time of day with me. Let the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the King hold his purpose, I will win for him and I can; if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OSR.">
  <li data-number="120">Shall I deliver you so?</li>

<ol data-speaker="HAM.">
  <li>To this effect, sir—after what flourish your nature will.</li>
