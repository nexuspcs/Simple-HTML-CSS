<h3>Scene 1</h3>

<h4>London. A room of state in the palace.</h4>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter King Edward, Derby, Prince Edward, Audley, and Artois.
	
		KING EDWARD.
		DERBY.
		PRINCE EDWARD.
		AUDLEY.
		ARTOIS.
		WARWICK.
		Lords
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li>Robert of Artois, banished though thou be</li>
  <li>From France, thy native Country, yet with us</li>
  <li>Thou shalt retain as great a Seigniorie:</li>
  <li>For we create thee Earl of Richmond here.</li>
  <li data-number="5">And now go forwards with our pedigree:</li>
  <li>Who next succeeded Philip le Bew?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARTOIS.">
  <li>Three sons of his, which all successfully</li>
  <li>Did sit upon their father’s regal throne,</li>
  <li>Yet died, and left no issue of their loins.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li data-number="10">But was my mother sister unto those?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARTOIS.">
  <li>She was, my lord; and only Isabel</li>
  <li>Was all the daughters that this Philip had,</li>
  <li>Whom afterward your father took to wife;</li>
  <li>And from the fragrant garden of her womb</li>
  <li data-number="15">Your gracious self, the flower of Europe’s hope,</li>
  <li>Derived is inheritor to France.</li>
  <li>But note the rancor of rebellious minds:</li>
  <li>When thus the lineage of le Bew was out,</li>
  <li>The French obscured your mother’s privilege,</li>
  <li data-number="20">And, though she were the next of blood, proclaimed</li>
  <li>John, of the house of Valois, now their king:</li>
  <li>The reason was, they say, the realm of France,</li>
  <li>Replete with princes of great parentage,</li>
  <li>Ought not admit a governor to rule,</li>
  <li data-number="25">Except he be descended of the male;</li>
  <li>And that’s the special ground of their contempt,</li>
  <li>Wherewith they study to exclude your grace:</li>
  <li>But they shall find that forged ground of theirs</li>
  <li>To be but dusty heaps of brittle sand.</li>
  <li data-number="30">Perhaps it will be thought a heinous thing,</li>
  <li>That I, a Frenchman, should discover this;</li>
  <li>But heaven I call to record of my vows:</li>
  <li>It is not hate nor any private wrong,</li>
  <li>But love unto my country and the right,</li>
  <li data-number="35">Provokes my tongue, thus lavish in report.</li>
  <li>You are the lineal watchman of our peace,</li>
  <li>And John of Valois indirectly climbs;</li>
  <li>What then should subjects but embrace their King?</li>
  <li>Ah, where in may our duty more be seen,</li>
  <li data-number="40">Than striving to rebate a tyrant’s pride</li>
  <li>And place the true shepherd of our commonwealth?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li>This counsel, Artois, like to fruitful showers,</li>
  <li>Hath added growth unto my dignity;</li>
  <li>And, by the fiery vigor of thy words,</li>
  <li data-number="45">Hot courage is engendered in my breast,</li>
  <li>Which heretofore was raked in ignorance,</li>
  <li>But now doth mount with golden wings of fame,</li>
  <li>And will approve fair Isabel’s descent,</li>
  <li>Able to yoke their stubborn necks with steel,</li>
  <li data-number="50">That spurn against my sovereignty in France.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">
	Sound a horn.

  <li>A messenger?—Lord Audley, know from whence.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Exit Audley, and returns.
	
		AUDLEY.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="AUDLEY.">
  <li>The Duke of Lorraine, having crossed the seas,</li>
  <li>Entreats he may have conference with your highness.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li>Admit him, lords, that we may hear the news.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">
	Exeunt lords.
	
		Lords
	
</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">
	King takes his State.
	
		KING EDWARD.
	
</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">
	Re-enter lords; with Lorraine, attended.
	
		Lords
		LORRAINE.
	
</li>
  <li data-number="55">Say, Duke of Lorraine, wherefore art thou come?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORRAINE.">
  <li>The most renowned prince, King John of France,</li>
  <li>Doth greet thee, Edward, and by me commands,</li>
  <li>That, for so much as by his liberal gift</li>
  <li>The Guyen Dukedom is entailed to thee,</li>
  <li data-number="60">Thou do him lowly homage for the same.</li>
  <li>And, for that purpose, here I summon thee,</li>
  <li>Repair to France within these forty days,</li>
  <li>That there, according as the custom is,</li>
  <li>Thou mayst be sworn true liegeman to our King;</li>
  <li data-number="65">Or else thy title in that province dies,</li>
  <li>And he himself will repossess the place.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li>See, how occasion laughs me in the face!</li>
  <li>No sooner minded to prepare for France,</li>
  <li>But straight I am invited,—nay, with threats,</li>
  <li data-number="70">Upon a penalty, enjoined to come:</li>
  <li>’Twere but a childish part to say him nay.—</li>
  <li>Lorraine, return this answer to thy lord:</li>
  <li>I mean to visit him as he requests;</li>
  <li>But how? Not servilely disposed to bend,</li>
  <li data-number="75">But like a conqueror to make him bow.</li>
  <li>His lame unpolished shifts are come to light;</li>
  <li>And truth hath pulled the vizard from his face,</li>
  <li>That set a gloss upon his arrogance.</li>
  <li>Dare he command a fealty in me?</li>
  <li data-number="80">Tell him, the Crown that he usurps, is mine,</li>
  <li>And where he sets his foot, he ought to kneel.</li>
  <li>’Tis not a petty dukedom that I claim,</li>
  <li>But all the whole dominions of the realm;</li>
  <li>Which if with grudging he refuse to yield,</li>
  <li data-number="85">I’ll take away those borrowed plumes of his,</li>
  <li>And send him naked to the wilderness.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORRAINE.">
  <li>Then, Edward, here, in spite of all thy lords,</li>
  <li>I do pronounce defiance to thy face.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE EDWARD.">
  <li>Defiance, Frenchman? We rebound it back,</li>
  <li data-number="90">Even to the bottom of thy master’s throat.</li>
  <li>And, be it spoke with reverence of the king,</li>
  <li>My gracious father, and these other lords,</li>
  <li>I hold thy message but as scurrilous,</li>
  <li>And him that sent thee, like the lazy drone,</li>
  <li data-number="95">Crept up by stealth unto the eagle’s nest;</li>
  <li>From whence we’ll shake him with so rough a storm,</li>
  <li>As others shall be warned by his harm.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK.">
  <li>Bid him leave of the lion’s case he wears,</li>
  <li>Least, meeting with the lion in the field,</li>
  <li data-number="100">He chance to tear him piecemeal for his pride.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARTOIS.">
  <li>The soundest counsel I can give his grace,</li>
  <li>Is to surrender ere he be constrained.</li>
  <li>A voluntary mischief hath less scorn,</li>
  <li>Than when reproach with violence is borne.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORRAINE.">
  <li data-number="105">Degenerate traitor, viper to the place</li>
  <li>Where thou was fostered in thine infancy,</li>
  <li>Bearest thou a part in this conspiracy?</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">
	He draws his sword.
	
		LORRAINE.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li>Lorraine, behold the sharpness of this steel:</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">
	Drawing his.
	
		KING EDWARD.
	
</li>
  <li>Fervent desire that sits against my heart,</li>
  <li data-number="110">Is far more thorny pricking than this blade;</li>
  <li>That, with the nightingale, I shall be scared,</li>
  <li>As oft as I dispose myself to rest,</li>
  <li>Until my colors be displayed in France:</li>
  <li>This is my final answer; so be gone.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORRAINE.">
  <li data-number="115">It is not that, nor any English brave,</li>
  <li>Afflicts me so, as doth his poisoned view,</li>
  <li>That is most false, should most of all be true.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Exeunt Lorraine, and Train.
	
		LORRAINE.
		Lords
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li>Now, lord, our fleeting bark is under sail;</li>
  <li>Our gage is thrown, and war is soon begun,</li>
  <li data-number="120">But not so quickly brought unto an end.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">
	Enter Mountague.
	
		MOUNTAGUE.
	
</li>
  <li>But wherefore comes Sir William Mountague?</li>
  <li>How stands the league between the Scot and us?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOUNTAGUE.">
  <li>Cracked and dissevered, my renowned lord.</li>
  <li>The treacherous King no sooner was informed</li>
  <li data-number="125">Of your with drawing of your army back,</li>
  <li>But straight, forgetting of his former oath,</li>
  <li>He made invasion on the bordering Towns:</li>
  <li>Barwick is won, Newcastle spoiled and lost,</li>
  <li>And now the tyrant hath begirt with siege</li>
  <li data-number="130">The castle of Rocksborough, where enclos’d</li>
  <li>The Countess Salisbury is like to perish.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li>That is thy daughter, Warwick, is it not?</li>
  <li>Whose husband hath in Britain served so long</li>
  <li>About the planting of Lord Mountford there?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK.">
  <li data-number="135">It is, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li>Ignoble David, hast thou none to grieve</li>
  <li>But silly Ladies with thy threatening arms?</li>
  <li>But I will make you shrink your snaily horns!</li>
  <li>First, therefore, Audley, this shall be thy charge,</li>
  <li data-number="140">Go levy footmen for our wars in France;</li>
  <li>And, Ned, take muster of our men at arms:</li>
  <li>In every shire elect a several band.</li>
  <li>Let them be Soldiers of a lusty spirit,</li>
  <li>Such as dread nothing but dishonor’s blot;</li>
  <li data-number="145">Be wary, therefore, since we do commence</li>
  <li>A famous war, and with so mighty a nation.</li>
  <li>Derby, be thou ambassador for us</li>
  <li>Unto our father in law, the Earl of Henalt:</li>
  <li>Make him acquainted with our enterprise,</li>
  <li data-number="150">And likewise will him, with our own allies</li>
  <li>That are in Flanders, to solicit to</li>
  <li>The Emperor of Almaigne in our name.</li>
  <li>Myself, whilst you are jointly thus employed,</li>
  <li>Will, with these forces that I have at hand,</li>
  <li data-number="155">March, and once more repulse the traitorous Scot.</li>
  <li>But, Sirs, be resolute: we shall have wars</li>
  <li>On every side; and, Ned, thou must begin</li>
  <li>Now to forget thy study and thy books,</li>
  <li>And ure thy shoulders to an armor’s weight.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE EDWARD.">
  <li data-number="160">As cheerful sounding to my youthful spleen</li>
  <li>This tumult is of war’s increasing broils,</li>
  <li>As, at the coronation of a king,</li>
  <li>The joyful clamors of the people are,</li>
  <li>When “Ave, Caesar!” they pronounce aloud.</li>
  <li data-number="165">Within this school of honor I shall learn</li>
  <li>Either to sacrifice my foes to death,</li>
  <li>Or in a rightful quarrel spend my breath.</li>
  <li>Then cheerfully forward, each a several way;</li>
  <li>In great affairs ’tis nought to use delay.</li>

<ol data-speaker="COUNTESS.">
  <li>Alas, how much in vain my poor eyes gaze</li>
  <li>For succor that my sovereign should send!</li>
  <li>Ah, cousin Mountague, I fear thou wants</li>
  <li>The lively spirit, sharply to solicit</li>
  <li data-number="5">With vehement suit the king in my behalf:</li>
  <li>Thou dost not tell him, what a grief it is</li>
  <li>To be the scornful captive of a Scot,</li>
  <li>Either to be wooed with broad untuned oaths,</li>
  <li>Or forced by rough insulting barbarism;</li>
  <li data-number="10">Thou doest not tell him, if he here prevail,</li>
  <li>How much they will deride us in the north,</li>

  <li>Touching your embassage, return and say,</li>
  <li>That we with England will not enter parley,</li>

  <li>But burn their neighbor towns, and so persist</li>
  <li data-number="25">With eager roads beyond their city York.</li>
  <li>And never shall our bonny riders rest,</li>

  <li>Their light borne snaffles nor their nimble spurs,</li>
  <li>Nor lay aside their Jacks of Gymould mayle,</li>
  <li data-number="30">Nor hang their staves of grained Scottish ash</li>
  <li>In peaceful wise upon their city walls,</li>

  <li>Cry out, “Enough! Spare England now for pity!”</li>
  <li data-number="35">Farewell, and tell him that you leave us here</li>
  <li>Before this castle; say, you came from us,</li>

  <li data-number="145">Our house, my liege, is like a country swain,</li>

  <li>For where the golden ore doth buried lie,</li>
  <li data-number="150">The ground, undecked with nature’s tapestry,</li>
  <li>Seems barren, sere, unfertile, fructless, dry;</li>
  <li>And where the upper turf of earth doth boast</li>
  <li>His pied perfumes and party colored coat,</li>
  <li>Delve there, and find this issue and their pride</li>
  <li data-number="155">To spring from ordure and corruption’s side.</li>
  <li>But, to make up my all too long compare,</li>
  <li>These ragged walls no testimony are,</li>
  <li>What is within; but, like a cloak, doth hide</li>
  <li>From weather’s Waste the under garnished pride.</li>
  <li data-number="160">More gracious then my terms can let thee be,</li>

  <li>I might perceive his eye in her eye lost,</li>
  <li>His ear to drink her sweet tongue’s utterance,</li>
  <li>And changing passion, like inconstant clouds</li>
  <li>That rack upon the carriage of the winds,</li>
  <li data-number="5">Increase and die in his disturbed cheeks.</li>
  <li>Lo, when she blushed, even then did he look pale,</li>
  <li>As if her cheeks by some enchanted power</li>
  <li>Attracted had the cherry blood from his:</li>
  <li>Anon, with reverent fear when she grew pale,</li>
  <li data-number="10">His cheeks put on their scarlet ornaments;</li>
  <li>But no more like her oriental red,</li>
  <li>Than brick to coral or live things to dead.</li>
  <li>Why did he then thus counterfeit her looks?</li>
  <li>If she did blush, twas tender modest shame,</li>
  <li data-number="15">Being in the sacred presence of a King;</li>
  <li>If he did blush, twas red immodest shame,</li>
  <li>To veil his eyes amiss, being a king;</li>
  <li>If she looked pale, twas silly woman’s fear,</li>
  <li>To bear herself in presence of a king;</li>
  <li data-number="20">If he looked pale, it was with guilty fear,</li>
  <li>To dote amiss, being a mighty king.</li>
  <li>Then, Scottish wars, farewell; I fear twill prove</li>

  <li data-number="25">She is grown more fairer far since I came hither,</li>
  <li>Her voice more silver every word than other,</li>
  <li>Her wit more fluent. What a strange discourse</li>
  <li>Unfolded she of David and his Scots!</li>
  <li>“Even thus,” quoth she, “he spake,” and then spoke broad,</li>
  <li data-number="30">With epithites and accents of the Scot,</li>
  <li>But somewhat better than the Scot could speak:</li>
  <li>“And thus,” quoth she, and answered then herself—</li>
  <li>For who could speak like her but she herself—</li>
  <li>Breathes from the wall an angel’s note from heaven</li>
  <li data-number="35">Of sweet defiance to her barbarous foes.</li>
  <li>When she would talk of peace, methinks, her tongue</li>
  <li>Commanded war to prison; when of war,</li>
  <li>It wakened Caesar from his Roman grave,</li>
  <li>To hear war beautified by her discourse.</li>
  <li data-number="40">Wisdom is foolishness but in her tongue,</li>
  <li>Beauty a slander but in her fair face,</li>
  <li>There is no summer but in her cheerful looks,</li>
  <li>Nor frosty winter but in her disdain.</li>
  <li>I cannot blame the Scots that did besiege her,</li>
  <li data-number="45">For she is all the treasure of our land;</li>
  <li>But call them cowards, that they ran away,</li>
  <li>Having so rich and fair a cause to stay.—</li>
  <li>Art thou there, Lodowick? Give me ink and paper.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LODOWICK.">
  <li>I will, my liege.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li data-number="50">And bid the lords hold on their play at chess,</li>

  <li>This fellow is well read in poetry,</li>

  <li data-number="55">I will acquaint him with my passion,</li>
  <li>Which he shall shadow with a veil of lawn,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LODOWICK.">
  <li data-number="60">Ready, my liege.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li>Then in the summer arbor sit by me,</li>
  <li>Make it our counsel house or cabinet:</li>
  <li>Since green our thoughts, green be the conventicle,</li>
  <li>Where we will ease us by disburdening them.</li>
  <li data-number="65">Now, Lodowick, invocate some golden muse,</li>
  <li>To bring thee hither an enchanted pen,</li>
  <li>That may for sighs set down true sighs indeed,</li>
  <li>Talking of grief, to make thee ready groan;</li>
  <li>And when thou writest of tears, encouch the word</li>
  <li data-number="70">Before and after with such sweet laments,</li>
  <li>That it may raise drops in a Tartar’s eye,</li>
  <li>And make a flintheart Scythian pitiful;</li>
  <li>For so much moving hath a Poet’s pen:</li>
  <li>Then, if thou be a poet, move thou so,</li>
  <li data-number="75">And be enriched by thy sovereign’s love.</li>
  <li>For, if the touch of sweet concordant strings</li>
  <li>Could force attendance in the ears of hell,</li>
  <li>How much more shall the strains of poets’ wit</li>
  <li>Beguile and ravish soft and humane minds?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LODOWICK.">
  <li data-number="80">To whom, my lord, shall I direct my stile?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li>To one that shames the fair and sots the wise;</li>
  <li>Whose bod is an abstract or a brief,</li>
  <li>Contains each general virtue in the world.</li>
  <li>Better than beautiful thou must begin,</li>
  <li data-number="85">Devise for fair a fairer word than fair,</li>
  <li>And every ornament that thou wouldest praise,</li>
  <li>Fly it a pitch above the soar of praise.</li>
  <li>For flattery fear thou not to be convicted;</li>
  <li>For, were thy admiration ten times more,</li>
  <li data-number="90">Ten times ten thousand more the worth exceeds</li>
  <li>Of that thou art to praise, thy praises worth.</li>
  <li>Begin; I will to contemplate the while:</li>
  <li>Forget not to set down, how passionate,</li>
  <li>How heart sick, and how full of languishment,</li>
  <li data-number="95">Her beauty makes me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LODOWICK.">
  <li>Write I to a woman?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li>What beauty else could triumph over me,</li>
  <li>Or who but women do our love lays greet?</li>
  <li>What, thinkest thou I did bid thee praise a horse?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LODOWICK.">
  <li data-number="100">Of what condition or estate she is,</li>
  <li>’Twere requisite that I should know, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li>Of such estate, that hers is as a throne,</li>
  <li>And my estate the footstool where she treads:</li>
  <li>Then mayst thou judge what her condition is</li>
  <li data-number="105">By the proportion of her mightiness.</li>
  <li>Write on, while I peruse her in my thoughts.—</li>
  <li>Her voice to music or the nightingale—</li>
  <li>To music every summer leaping swain</li>
  <li>Compares his sunburnt lover when she speaks;</li>
  <li data-number="110">And why should I speak of the nightingale?</li>
  <li>The nightingale sings of adulterate wrong,</li>
  <li>And that, compared, is too satyrical;</li>
  <li>For sin, though sin, would not be so esteemed,</li>
  <li>But, rather, virtue sin, sin virtue deemed.</li>
  <li data-number="115">Her hair, far softer than the silk worm’s twist,</li>
  <li>Like to a flattering glass, doth make more fair</li>
  <li>The yellow Amber:—like a flattering glass</li>
  <li>Comes in too soon; for, writing of her eyes,</li>
  <li>I’ll say that like a glass they catch the sun,</li>
  <li data-number="120">And thence the hot reflection doth rebound</li>
  <li>Against the breast, and burns my heart within.</li>
  <li>Ah, what a world of descant makes my soul</li>
  <li>Upon this voluntary ground of love!—</li>
  <li>Come, Lodowick, hast thou turned thy ink to gold?</li>
  <li data-number="125">If not, write but in letters capital</li>
  <li>My mistress’ name, and it will gild thy paper:</li>
  <li>Read, lord, read;</li>
  <li>Fill thou the empty hollows of mine ears</li>
  <li>With the sweet hearing of thy poetry.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LODOWICK.">
  <li data-number="130">I have not to a period brought her praise.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li>Her praise is as my love, both infinite,</li>
  <li>Which apprehend such violent extremes,</li>
  <li>That they disdain an ending period.</li>
  <li>Her beauty hath no match but my affection;</li>
  <li data-number="135">Hers more than most, mine most and more than more:</li>
  <li>Hers more to praise than tell the sea by drops,</li>
  <li>Nay, more than drop the massy earth by sands,</li>
  <li>And sand by sand print them in memory:</li>
  <li>Then wherefore talkest thou of a period</li>
  <li data-number="140">To that which craves unended admiration?</li>
  <li>Read, let us hear.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LODOWICK.">
  <li><recite>“More fair and chaste than is the queen of shades,”—</recite></li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li>That line hath two faults, gross and palpable:</li>
  <li>Comparest thou her to the pale queen of night,</li>
  <li data-number="145">Who, being set in dark, seems therefore light?</li>
  <li>What is she, when the sun lifts up his head,</li>
  <li>But like a fading taper, dim and dead?</li>
  <li>My love shall brave the eye of heaven at noon,</li>
  <li>And, being unmasked, outshine the golden sun.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LODOWICK.">
  <li data-number="150">What is the other fault, my sovereign lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li>Read o’er the line again.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LODOWICK.">
  <li><recite>“More fair and chaste”—</recite></li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li>I did not bid thee talk of chastity,</li>
  <li>To ransack so the treasure of her mind;</li>
  <li data-number="155">For I had rather have her chased than chaste.</li>
  <li>Out with the moon line, I will none of it;</li>
  <li>And let me have her likened to the sun:</li>
  <li>Say she hath thrice more splendor than the sun,</li>
  <li>That her perfections emulate the sun,</li>
  <li data-number="160">That she breeds sweets as plenteous as the sun,</li>
  <li>That she doth thaw cold winter like the sun,</li>
  <li>That she doth cheer fresh summer like the sun,</li>
  <li>The she doth dazzle gazers like the sun;</li>
  <li>And, in this application to the sun,</li>
  <li data-number="165">Bid her be free and general as the sun,</li>
  <li>Who smiles upon the basest weed that grows</li>
  <li>As lovingly as on the fragrant rose.</li>
  <li>Let’s see what follows that same moonlight line.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LODOWICK.">
  <li>“More fair and chaste than is the queen of shades,</li>
  <li>More bold in constance”—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li data-number="170" data-offset="5">In constance! Than who?</li>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li>O monstrous line! Put in the next a sword,</li>
  <li>And I shall woo her to cut off my head.</li>
  <li>Blot, blot, good Lodowick! Let us hear the next.</li>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li>I thank thee then; thou hast done little ill,</li>

  <li>No, let the captain talk of boisterous war,</li>
  <li>The prisoner of emured dark constraint,</li>
  <li data-number="180">The sick man best sets down the pangs of death,</li>
  <li>The man that starves the sweetness of a feast,</li>
  <li>The frozen soul the benefit of fire,</li>

  <li>The sun, that withers hay, doth nourish grass;</li>
  <li>The king, that would disdain thee, will advance thee.</li>
  <li data-number="395">The poets write that great Achilles’ spear</li>
  <li>Could heal the wound it made: the moral is,</li>
  <li>What mighty men misdo, they can amend.</li>
  <li>The lion doth become his bloody jaws,</li>
  <li>And grace his forragement by being mild,</li>
  <li data-number="400">When vassel fear lies trembling at his feet.</li>
  <li>The king will in his glory hide thy shame;</li>

  <li>What can one drop of poison harm the sea,</li>

  <li>Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds;</li>

  <li>Then might ye see the reeling vessels split,</li>
  <li data-number="170">And tottering sink into the ruthless flood,</li>
  <li>Until their lofty tops were seen no more.</li>
  <li>All shifts were tried, both for defense and hurt:</li>

  <li>Of resolution and of cowardice,</li>
  <li data-number="175">We lively pictures; how the one for fame,</li>
  <li>The other by compulsion laid about;</li>
  <li>Much did the Nonpareille, that brave ship;</li>
  <li>So did the Black Snake of Bullen, then which</li>
  <li>A bonnier vessel never yet spread sail.</li>
  <li data-number="180">But all in vain; both sun, the wind and tide,</li>
  <li>Revolted all unto our foe men’s side,</li>
  <li>That we perforce were fain to give them way,</li>

<ol data-speaker="KING JOHN.">
  <li>Edward, know that John, the true king of France,</li>
  <li>Musing thou shouldst encroach upon his land,</li>
  <li>And in thy tyrannous proceeding slay</li>
  <li>His faithful subjects and subvert his towns,</li>
  <li data-number="50">Spits in thy face; and in this manner following</li>
  <li>Obraids thee with thine arrogant intrusion:</li>
  <li>First, I condemn thee for a fugitive,</li>
  <li>A thievish pirate, and a needy mate,</li>
  <li>One that hath either no abiding place,</li>
  <li data-number="55">Or else, inhabiting some barren soil,</li>
  <li>Where neither herb or fruitful grain is had,</li>
  <li>Doest altogether live by pilfering:</li>
  <li>Next, insomuch thou hast infringed thy faith,</li>
  <li>Broke league and solemn covenant made with me,</li>
  <li data-number="60">I hold thee for a false pernicious wretch:</li>
  <li>And, last of all, although I scorn to cope</li>
  <li>With one so much inferior to myself,</li>
  <li>Yet, in respect thy thirst is all for gold,</li>
  <li>Thy labour rather to be feared than loved,</li>
  <li data-number="65">To satisfy thy lust in either part,</li>
  <li>Here am I come, and with me have I brought</li>
  <li>Exceeding store of treasure, pearl, and coin.</li>
  <li>Leave, therefore, now to persecute the weak,</li>
  <li>And armed entering conflict with the armed,</li>
  <li data-number="70">Let it be seen, ’mongst other petty thefts,</li>
  <li>How thou canst win this pillage manfully.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li>If gall or wormwood have a pleasant taste,</li>
  <li>Then is thy salutation honey sweet;</li>
  <li>But as the one hath no such property,</li>
  <li data-number="75">So is the other most satirical.</li>
  <li>Yet wot how I regard thy worthless taunts:</li>
  <li>If thou have uttered them to foil my fame</li>
  <li>Or dim the reputation of my birth,</li>
  <li>Know that thy wolvish barking cannot hurt;</li>
  <li data-number="80">If slyly to insinuate with the world,</li>
  <li>And with a strumpet’s artificial line</li>
  <li>To paint thy vicious and deformed cause,</li>
  <li>Be well assured, the counterfeit will fade,</li>
  <li>And in the end thy foul defects be seen;</li>
  <li data-number="85">But if thou didst it to provoke me on,</li>
  <li>As who should say I were but timorous.</li>
  <li>Or, coldly negligent, did need a spur,</li>
  <li>Bethink thyself how slack I was at sea,</li>
  <li>How since my landing I have won no towns,</li>
  <li data-number="90">Entered no further but upon the coast,</li>
  <li>And there have ever since securely slept.</li>
  <li>But if I have been other wise employed,</li>
  <li>Imagine, Valois, whether I intend</li>
  <li>To skirmish, not for pillage, but for the crown</li>
  <li data-number="95">Which thou dost wear; and that I vow to have,</li>
  <li>Or one of us shall fall into his grave.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE EDWARD.">
  <li>Look not for cross invectives at our hands,</li>
  <li>Or railing execrations of despite:</li>
  <li>Let creeping serpents, hid in hollow banks,</li>
  <li data-number="100">Sting with their tongues; we have remorseless swords,</li>
  <li>And they shall plead for us and our affairs.</li>
  <li>Yet thus much, briefly, by my father’s leave:</li>
  <li>As all the immodest poison of thy throat</li>
  <li>Is scandalous and most notorious lies,</li>
  <li data-number="105">And our pretended quarrel is truly just,</li>
  <li>So end the battle when we meet today:</li>
  <li>May either of us prosper and prevail,</li>
  <li>Or, luckless, curst, receive eternal shame!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li>That needs no further question; and I know,</li>
  <li data-number="110">His conscience witnesseth, it is my right.—</li>
  <li>Therefore, Valois, say, wilt thou yet resign,</li>
  <li>Before the sickles thrust into the corn,</li>
  <li>Or that inkindled fury turn to flame?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING JOHN.">
  <li>Edward, I know what right thou hast in France;</li>
  <li data-number="115">And ere I basely will resign my crown,</li>
  <li>This champion field shall be a pool of blood,</li>
  <li>And all our prospect as a slaughter house.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE EDWARD.">
  <li>Aye, that approves thee, tyrant, what thou art:</li>
  <li>No father, king, or shepherd of thy realm,</li>
  <li data-number="120">But one, that tears her entrails with thy hands,</li>
  <li>And, like a thirsty tiger, suckst her blood.</li>

<ol data-speaker="KING JOHN.">
  <li data-number="140">Lords and my loving subjects, now’s the time,</li>
  <li>That your intended force must bide the touch.</li>
  <li>Therefore, my friends, consider this in brief:</li>
  <li>He that you fight for is your natural King;</li>
  <li>He against whom you fight, a foreigner:</li>
  <li data-number="145">He that you fight for, rules in clemency,</li>
  <li>And reins you with a mild and gentle bit;</li>
  <li>He against whom you fight, if he prevail,</li>
  <li>Will straight inthrone himself in tyranny,</li>
  <li>Makes slaves of you, and with a heavy hand</li>
  <li data-number="150">Curtail and curb your sweetest liberty.</li>
  <li>Then, to protect your country and your King,</li>
  <li>Let but the haughty courage of your hearts</li>
  <li>Answer the number of your able hands,</li>
  <li>And we shall quickly chase these fugitives.</li>
  <li data-number="155">For what’s this Edward but a belly god,</li>
  <li>A tender and lascivious wantoness,</li>
  <li>That thother day was almost dead for love?</li>
  <li>And what, I pray you, is his goodly guard?</li>
  <li>Such as, but scant them of their chines of beef</li>
  <li data-number="160">And take away their downy featherbeds,</li>
  <li>And presently they are as resty stiff,</li>

  <li>Thou mayst be quit, and if thou wilt thyself.</li>

  <li>Which thou mayst easily obtain, I think,</li>

  <li>I wonder, Villiers, thou shouldest importune me</li>
  <li>For one that is our deadly enemy.</li>

  <li>Not for his sake, my gracious lord, so much</li>
  <li>Am I become an earnest advocate,</li>
  <li data-number="5">As that thereby my ransom will be quit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CHARLES.">
  <li>Thy ransom, man? Why needest thou talk of that?</li>
  <li>Art thou not free? And are not all occasions,</li>
  <li>That happen for advantage of our foes,</li>
  <li>To be accepted of, and stood upon?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VILLIERS.">
  <li data-number="10">No, good my lord, except the same be just;</li>
  <li>For profit must with honor be comixt,</li>
  <li>Or else our actions are but scandalous.</li>
  <li>But, letting pass their intricate objections,</li>
  <li>Wilt please your highness to subscribe, or no?</li>

  <li>Salisbury shall not have his will so much,</li>
  <li>To claim a passport how it pleaseth himself.</li>

<ol data-speaker="VILLIERS.">
  <li>Why, then I know the extremity, my lord;</li>
  <li>I must return to prison whence I came.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CHARLES.">
  <li data-number="20">Return? I hope thou wilt not;</li>
  <li>What bird that hath escaped the fowler’s gin,</li>
  <li>Will not beware how she’s ensnared again?</li>
  <li>Or, what is he, so senseless and secure,</li>
  <li>That, having hardly past a dangerous gul,</li>
  <li data-number="25">Will put himself in peril there again?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VILLIERS.">
  <li>Ah, but it is mine oath, my gracious lord,</li>
  <li>Which I in conscience may not violate,</li>
  <li>Or else a kingdom should not draw me hence.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CHARLES.">
  <li>Thine oath? Why, tat doth bind thee to abide:</li>
  <li data-number="30">Hast thou not sworn obedience to thy Prince?</li>

<ol data-speaker="VILLIERS.">
  <li>In all things that uprightly he commands:</li>
  <li>But either to persuade or threaten me,</li>
  <li>Not to perform the covenant of my word,</li>
  <li>Is lawless, and I need not to obey.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CHARLES.">
  <li data-number="35">Why, is it lawful for a man to kill,</li>
  <li>And not, to break a promise with his foe?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VILLIERS.">
  <li>To kill, my lord, when war is once proclaimed,</li>
  <li>So that our quarrel be for wrongs received,</li>
  <li>No doubt, is lawfully permitted us;</li>
  <li data-number="40">But in an oath we must be well advised,</li>
  <li>How we do swear, and, when we once have sworn,</li>
  <li>Not to infringe it, though we die therefore:</li>
  <li>Therefore, my lord, as willing I return,</li>
  <li>As if I were to fly to paradise.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CHARLES.">
  <li data-number="45">Stay, my Villiers; thine honorable min</li>

  <li>Thy suit shall be no longer thus deferred:</li>

<ol data-speaker="KING JOHN.">
  <li>By this it seems we shall be fortunate:</li>

  <li>So is it like, we shall not be subdued:</li>

  <li>And forage their country as they have done ours,</li>
  <li>By this revenge that loss will seem the less.</li>

<ol data-speaker="AUDLEY.">
  <li data-number="10">This sudden, mighty, and expedient head</li>
  <li>That they have made, fair prince, is wonderful.</li>
  <li>Before us in the valley lies the king,</li>
  <li>Vantaged with all that heaven and earth can yield;</li>
  <li>His party stronger battled than our whole:</li>
  <li data-number="15">His son, the braving Duke of Normandy,</li>
  <li>Hath trimmed the mountain on our right hand up</li>
  <li>In shining plate, that now the aspiring hill</li>
  <li>Shews like a silver quarry or an orb,</li>
  <li>Aloft the which the banners, bannarets,</li>
  <li data-number="20">And new replenished pendants cuff the air</li>
  <li>And beat the winds, that for their gaudiness</li>
  <li>Struggles to kiss them: on our left hand lies</li>
  <li>Philip, the younger issue of the king,</li>
  <li>Coating the other hill in such array,</li>
  <li data-number="25">That all his guilded upright pikes do seem</li>
  <li>Straight trees of gold, the pendants leaves;</li>
  <li>And their device of antique heraldry,</li>
  <li>Quartered in colors, seeming sundry fruits,</li>
  <li>Makes it the orchard of the Hesperides:</li>
  <li data-number="30">Behind us too the hill doth bear his height,</li>
  <li>For like a half-moon, opening but one way,</li>
  <li>It rounds us in; there at our backs are lodged</li>
  <li>The fatal crossbows, and the battle there</li>
  <li>Is governed by the rough Chatillion.</li>
  <li data-number="35">Then thus it stands: the valley for our flight</li>
  <li>The king binds in; the hills on either hand</li>
  <li>Are proudly royalized by his sons;</li>
  <li>And on the Hill behind stands certain death</li>
  <li>In pay and service with Chatillion.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE EDWARD.">
  <li data-number="40">Death’s name is much more mighty than his deeds;</li>
  <li>Thy parcelling this power hath made it more.</li>

  <li>Then, all the world, and call it but a power,</li>
  <li data-number="45">Easily ta’en up, and quickly thrown away:</li>
  <li>But if I stand to count them sand by sand,</li>
  <li>The number would confound my memory,</li>
  <li>And make a thousand millions of a task,</li>
  <li>Which briefly is no more, indeed, than one.</li>
  <li data-number="50">These quarters, squadrons, and these regiments,</li>
  <li>Before, behind us, and on either hand,</li>

  <li>His hand, his foot, his head hath several strengths;</li>
  <li>And being all but one self instant strength,</li>
  <li data-number="55">Why, all this many, Audley, is but one,</li>
  <li>And we can call it all but one man’s strength.</li>
  <li>He that hath far to go, tells it by miles;</li>
  <li>If he should tell the steps, it kills his heart:</li>
  <li>The drops are infinite, that make a flood,</li>
  <li data-number="60">And yet, thou knowest, we call it but a Rain.</li>
  <li>There is but one France, one King of France,</li>

  <li>No more, Queen Philip, pacify yourself;</li>
  <li>Copland, except he can excuse his fault,</li>
  <li>Shall find displeasure written in our looks.</li>
  <li>And now unto this proud resisting town!</li>
  <li data-number="5">Soldiers, assault: I will no longer stay,</li>
  <li>To be deluded by their false delays;</li>

<ol data-speaker="ALL. CIT. CAL.">
  <li>Mercy, king Edward, mercy, gracious lord!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li>Contemptuous villains, call ye now for truce?</li>
  <li data-number="10">Mine ears are stopped against your bootless cries:—</li>
  <li>Sound, drums alarum; draw threatening swords!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. CIT. CAL.">
  <li>Ah, noble Prince, take pity on this town,</li>
  <li>And hear us, mighty king:</li>
  <li>We claim the promise that your highness made;</li>
  <li data-number="15">The two days’ respite is not yet expired,</li>
  <li>And we are come with willingness to bear</li>
  <li>What torturing death or punishment you please,</li>
  <li>So that the trembling multitude be saved.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li>My promise? Well, I do confess as much:</li>
  <li data-number="20">But I do require the chiefest citizens</li>
  <li>And men of most account that should submit;</li>
  <li>You, peradventure, are but servile grooms,</li>
  <li>Or some felonious robbers on the sea,</li>
  <li>Whom, apprehended, law would execute,</li>
  <li data-number="25">Albeit severity lay dead in us:</li>
  <li>No, no, ye cannot overreach us thus.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. CIT. CAL.">
  <li>The sun, dread lord, that in the western fall</li>
  <li>Beholds us now low brought through misery,</li>
  <li>Did in the Orient purple of the morn</li>
  <li data-number="30">Salute our coming forth, when we were known;</li>
  <li>Or may our portion be with damned fiends.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li>If it be so, then let our covenant stand:</li>
  <li>We take possession of the town in peace,</li>
  <li>But, for yourselves, look you for no remorse;</li>
  <li data-number="35">But, as imperial justice hath decreed,</li>
  <li>Your bodies shall be dragged about these walls,</li>
  <li>And after feel the stroke of quartering steel:</li>
  <li>This is your doom;—go, soldiers, see it done.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN PHILIP.">
  <li>Ah, be more mild unto these yielding men!</li>
  <li data-number="40">It is a glorious thing to stablish peace,</li>
  <li>And kings approach the nearest unto God</li>
  <li>By giving life and safety unto men:</li>
  <li>As thou intendest to be King of France,</li>
  <li>So let her people live to call thee king;</li>
  <li data-number="45">For what the sword cuts down or fire hath spoiled,</li>
  <li>Is held in reputation none of ours.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li>Although experience teach us this is true,</li>
  <li>That peaceful quietness brings most delight,</li>
  <li>When most of all abuses are controlled;</li>
  <li data-number="50">Yet, insomuch it shall be known that we</li>
  <li>As well can master our affections</li>
  <li>As conquer other by the dint of sword,</li>
  <li>Philip, prevail; we yield to thy request:</li>
  <li>These men shall live to boast of clemency,</li>
  <li data-number="55">And, tyranny, strike terror to thyself.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. CIT. CAL.">
  <li>Long live your highness! Happy be your reign!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li>Go, get you hence, return unto the town,</li>
  <li>And if this kindness hath deserved your love,</li>
  <li>Learn then to reverence Edward as your king.—</li>

</li>
  <li data-number="60">Now, might we hear of our affairs abroad,</li>
  <li>We would, till gloomy winter were o’er spent,</li>
  <li>Dispose our men in garrison a while.</li>
  <li>But who comes here?</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Copland and King David.
	
		COPLAND.
		KING DAVID.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="DERBY.">
  <li>Copland, my lord, and David, King of Scots.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li data-number="65">Is this the proud presumptuous esquire of the north,</li>
  <li>That would not yield his prisoner to my Queen?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COPLAND.">
  <li>I am, my liege, a northern esquire indeed,</li>
  <li>But neither proud nor insolent, I trust.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li>What moved thee, then, to be so obstinate</li>
  <li data-number="70">To contradict our royal Queen’s desire?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COPLAND.">
  <li>No willful disobedience, mighty lord,</li>
  <li>But my desert and public law at arms:</li>
  <li>I took the king myself in single fight,</li>
  <li>And, like a soldiers, would be loath to lose</li>
  <li data-number="75">The least pre-eminence that I had won.</li>
  <li>And Copland straight upon your highness’ charge</li>
  <li>Is come to France, and with a lowly mind</li>
  <li>Doth vale the bonnet of his victory:</li>
  <li>Receive, dread lord, the custom of my fraught,</li>
  <li data-number="80">The wealthy tribute of my laboring hands,</li>
  <li>Which should long since have been surrendered up,</li>
  <li>Had but your gracious self been there in place.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN PHILIP.">
  <li>But, Copland, thou didst scorn the king’s command,</li>
  <li>Neglecting our commission in his name.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COPLAND.">
  <li data-number="85">His name I reverence, but his person more;</li>
  <li>His name shall keep me in allegiance still,</li>
  <li>But to his person I will bend my knee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li>I pray thee, Philip, let displeasure pass;</li>
  <li>This man doth please me, and I like his words:</li>
  <li data-number="90">For what is he that will attempt great deeds,</li>
  <li>And lose the glory that ensues the same?</li>
  <li>All rivers have recourse unto the sea,</li>
  <li>And Copland’s faith relation to his king.</li>
  <li>Kneel, therefore, down: now rise, king Edward’s knight;</li>
  <li data-number="95">And, to maintain thy state, I freely give</li>
  <li>Five hundred marks a year to thee and thine.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">
	Enter Salisbury.
	
		SALISBURY.
	
</li>
  <li>Welcome, lord Salisbury: what news from Britain?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SALISBURY.">
  <li>This, mighty king: the country we have won,</li>
  <li>And John de Mountford, regent of that place,</li>
  <li data-number="100">Presents your highness with this coronet,</li>
  <li>Protesting true allegiance to your Grace.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li>We thank thee for thy service, valiant Earl;</li>
  <li>Challenge our favor, for we owe it thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SALISBURY.">
  <li>But now, my lord, as this is joyful news,</li>
  <li data-number="105">So must my voice be tragical again,</li>
  <li>And I must sing of doleful accidents.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li>What, have our men the overthrow at Poictiers?</li>
  <li>Or is our son beset with too much odds?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SALISBURY.">
  <li>He was, my lord: and as my worthless self</li>
  <li data-number="110">With forty other serviceable knights,</li>
  <li>Under safe conduct of the Dauphin’s seal,</li>
  <li>Did travail that way, finding him distressed,</li>
  <li>A troop of lances met us on the way,</li>
  <li>Surprised, and brought us prisoners to the king,</li>
  <li data-number="115">Who, proud of this, and eager of revenge,</li>
  <li>Commanded straight to cut off all our heads:</li>
  <li>And surely we had died, but that the Duke,</li>
  <li>More full of honor than his angry sire,</li>
  <li>Procured our quick deliverance from thence;</li>
  <li data-number="120">But, ere we went, “Salute your king,” quoth he,</li>
  <li>“Bid him provide a funeral for his son:</li>
  <li>To day our sword shall cut his thread of life;</li>
  <li>And, sooner than he thinks, we’ll be with him,</li>
  <li>To quittance those displeasures he hath done.”</li>
  <li data-number="125">This said, we past, not daring to reply;</li>
  <li>Our hearts were dead, our looks diffused and wan.</li>
  <li>Wandering, at last we climbed unto a hill,</li>
  <li>From whence, although our grief were much before,</li>
  <li>Yet now to see the occasion with our eyes</li>
  <li data-number="130">Did thrice so much increase our heaviness:</li>
  <li>For there, my lord, oh, there we did descry</li>
  <li>Down in a valley how both armies lay.</li>
  <li>The French had cast their trenches like a ring,</li>
  <li>And every barricado’s open front</li>
  <li data-number="135">Was thick embossed with brazen ordinance;</li>
  <li>Here stood a battaile of ten thousand horse,</li>
  <li>There twice as many pikes in quadrant wise,</li>
  <li>Here crossbows, and deadly wounding darts:</li>
  <li>And in the midst, like to a slender point</li>
  <li data-number="140">Within the compass of the horizon,</li>
  <li>(As twere a rising bubble in the sea,</li>
  <li>A hazel wand amidst a wood of pines,</li>
  <li>Or as a bear fast chained unto a stake),</li>
  <li>Stood famous Edward, still expecting when</li>
  <li data-number="145">Those dogs of France would fasten on his flesh.</li>
  <li>Anon the death procuring knell begins:</li>
  <li>Off go the cannons, that with trembling noise</li>
  <li>Did shake the very mountain where they stood;</li>
  <li>Then sound the trumpets’ clangor in the air,</li>
  <li data-number="150">The battles join: and, when we could no more</li>
  <li>Discern the difference twixt the friend and foe,</li>
  <li>So intricate the dark confusion was,</li>
  <li>Away we turned our watery eyes with sighs,</li>
  <li>As black as powder fuming into smoke.</li>
  <li data-number="155">And thus, I fear, unhappy have I told</li>
  <li>The most untimely tale of Edward’s fall.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN PHILIP.">
  <li>Ah me, is this my welcome into France?</li>
  <li>Is this the comfort that I looked to have,</li>
  <li>When I should meet with my beloved son?</li>
  <li data-number="160">Sweet Ned, I would thy mother in the sea</li>
  <li>Had been prevented of this mortal grief!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li>Content thee, Philip; ’tis not tears will serve</li>
  <li>To call him back, if he be taken hence:</li>
  <li>Comfort thyself, as I do, gentle Queen,</li>
  <li data-number="165">With hope of sharp, unheard of, dire revenge.—</li>
  <li>He bids me to provide his funeral,</li>
  <li>And so I will; but all the peers in France</li>
  <li>Shall mourners be, and weep out bloody tears,</li>
  <li>Until their empty veins be dry and sere:</li>
  <li data-number="170">The pillars of his hearse shall be his bones;</li>
  <li>The mould that covers him, their city ashes;</li>
  <li>His knell, the groaning cries of dying men;</li>
  <li>And, in the stead of tapers on his tomb,</li>
  <li>An hundred fifty towers shall burning blaze,</li>
  <li data-number="175">While we bewail our valiant son’s decease.</li>

  <li>So, John of France, I see you keep your word:</li>
  <li data-number="200">You promised to be sooner with our self</li>

  <li>But, had you done at first as now you do,</li>
  <li>How many civil towns had stood untouched,</li>
  <li>That now are turned to ragged heaps of stones!</li>
  <li data-number="205">How many people’s lives mightst thou have saved,</li>

<ol data-speaker="KING JOHN.">
  <li>Edward, recount not things irrevocable;</li>

  <li data-number="220">So thou wilt grant that many princes more,</li>

  <li>And, for my part, the bloody scars I bear,</li>
  <li>And weary nights that I have watched in field,</li>
  <li data-number="225">The dangerous conflicts I have often had,</li>
  <li>The fearful menaces were proffered me,</li>
  <li>The heat and cold and what else might displease:</li>
  <li>I wish were now redoubled twenty fold,</li>
  <li>So that hereafter ages, when they read</li>
  <li data-number="230">The painful traffic of my tender youth,</li>
  <li>Might thereby be inflamed with such resolve,</li>
  <li>As not the territories of France alone,</li>
  <li>But likewise Spain, Turkey, and what countries else</li>
  <li>That justly would provoke fair England’s ire,</li>
  <li data-number="235">Might, at their presence, tremble and retire.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li>Here, English lords, we do proclaim a rest,</li>
  <li>An intercession of our painful arms:</li>
  <li>Sheath up your swords, refresh your weary limbs,</li>
  <li>Peruse your spoils; and, after we have breathed</li>
  <li data-number="240">A day or two within this haven town,</li>
  <li>God willing, then for England we’ll be shipped;</li>
  <li>Where, in a happy hour, I trust, we shall</li>
  <li>Arrive, three kings, two princes, and a queen.</li>
