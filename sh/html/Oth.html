<h3>Scene 1</h3>

<h4>Venice. A street.</h4>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Roderigo and Iago.
	
		ROD.
		IAGO.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="ROD.">
  <li>Tush, never tell me! I take it much unkindly</li>
  <li>That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse</li>
  <li>As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li>’Sblood, but you’ll not hear me.</li>
  <li data-number="5">If ever I did dream of such a matter,</li>
  <li>Abhor me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROD.">
  <li>Thou toldst me thou didst hold him in thy hate.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li>Despise me</li>
  <li>If I do not. Three great ones of the city,</li>
  <li data-number="10">In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,</li>
  <li>Off-capp’d to him; and, by the faith of man,</li>
  <li>I know my price, I am worth no worse a place.</li>
  <li>But he (as loving his own pride and purposes)</li>
  <li>Evades them with a bombast circumstance</li>
  <li data-number="15">Horribly stuff’d with epithites of war,</li>
  <li>And in conclusion,</li>
  <li>Nonsuits my mediators; for, “Certes,” says he,</li>
  <li>“I have already chose my officer.”</li>
  <li>And what was he?</li>
  <li data-number="20">Forsooth, a great arithmetician,</li>
  <li>One Michael Cassio, a Florentine</li>
  <li>(A fellow almost damn’d in a fair wife),</li>
  <li>That never set a squadron in the field,</li>
  <li>Nor the division of a battle knows</li>
  <li data-number="25">More than a spinster—unless the bookish theoric,</li>
  <li>Wherein the toged consuls can propose</li>
  <li>As masterly as he. Mere prattle, without practice,</li>
  <li>Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had th’ election;</li>
  <li>And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof</li>
  <li data-number="30">At Rhodes, at Cyprus, and on other grounds</li>
  <li>Christen’d and heathen, must be belee’d and calm’d</li>
  <li>By debitor and creditor—this counter—caster,</li>
  <li>He (in good time!) must his lieutenant be,</li>
  <li>And I (God bless the mark!) his Moorship’s ancient.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROD.">
  <li data-number="35">By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li>Why, there’s no remedy. ’Tis the curse of service;</li>
  <li>Preferment goes by letter and affection,</li>
  <li>And not by old gradation, where each second</li>
  <li>Stood heir to th’ first. Now, sir, be judge yourself</li>
  <li>Whether I in any just term am affin’d</li>
  <li>To love the Moor.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROD.">
  <li data-offset="4">I would not follow him then.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li>O, sir, content you;</li>
  <li>I follow him to serve my turn upon him.</li>
  <li>We cannot all be masters, nor all masters</li>
  <li data-number="45">Cannot be truly follow’d. You shall mark</li>
  <li>Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave</li>
  <li>That (doting on his own obsequious bondage)</li>
  <li>Wears out his time, much like his master’s ass,</li>
  <li>For nought but provender, and when he’s old, cashier’d.</li>
  <li data-number="50">Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are</li>
  <li>Who, trimm’d in forms and visages of duty,</li>
  <li>Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,</li>
  <li>And throwing but shows of service on their lords,</li>
  <li>Do well thrive by them; and when they have lin’d their coats,</li>
  <li data-number="55">Do themselves homage. These fellows have some soul,</li>
  <li>And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,</li>
  <li>It is as sure as you are Roderigo,</li>
  <li>Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago.</li>
  <li>In following him, I follow but myself;</li>
  <li data-number="60">Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,</li>
  <li>But seeming so, for my peculiar end;</li>
  <li>For when my outward action doth demonstrate</li>
  <li>The native act and figure of my heart</li>
  <li>In complement extern, ’tis not long after</li>
  <li data-number="65">But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve</li>
  <li>For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROD.">
  <li>What a full fortune does the thick-lips owe</li>
  <li>If he can carry’t thus!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li data-offset="4">Call up her father.</li>
  <li>Rouse him, make after him, poison his delight,</li>
  <li data-number="70">Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,</li>
  <li>And though he in a fertile climate dwell,</li>
  <li>Plague him with flies. Though that his joy be joy,</li>
  <li>Yet throw such changes of vexation on’t,</li>
  <li>As it may lose some color.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROD.">
  <li data-number="75">Here is her father’s house, I’ll call aloud.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li>Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell</li>
  <li>As when, by night and negligence, the fire</li>
  <li>Is spied in populous cities.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROD.">
  <li>What ho! Brabantio, <foreign xml:lang="it">Signior</foreign> Brabantio, ho!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li data-number="80">Awake! What ho, Brabantio! Thieves, thieves!</li>
  <li>Look to your house, your daughter, and your bags!</li>
  <li>Thieves, thieves!</li>

  <li>’Zounds, sir, y’ are robb’d! For shame, put on your gown;</li>
  <li>Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;</li>
  <li>Even now, now, very now, an old black ram</li>
  <li data-number="90">Is tupping your white ewe. Arise, arise!</li>
  <li>Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,</li>
  <li>Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you.</li>
  <li>Arise, I say!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BRA.">
  <li data-offset="3">What, have you lost your wits?</li>

  <li>Most reverend <foreign xml:lang="it">signior</foreign>, do you know my voice?</li>

  <li>Not I; what are you?</li>

<ol data-speaker="ROD.">
  <li>My name is Roderigo.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BRA.">
  <li data-offset="4">The worser welcome;</li>
  <li>I have charg’d thee not to haunt about my doors.</li>
  <li>In honest plainness thou hast heard me say</li>
  <li>My daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness</li>
  <li data-number="100">(Being full of supper and distemp’ring draughts),</li>
  <li>Upon malicious bravery dost thou come</li>
  <li>To start my quiet.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROD.">
  <li>Sir, sir, sir—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BRA.">
  <li data-offset="3">But thou must needs be sure</li>
  <li>My spirits and my place have in their power</li>
  <li>To make this bitter to thee.</li>

<ol data-speaker="ROD.">
  <li data-number="105" data-offset="5">Patience, good sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BRA.">
  <li>What tell’st thou me of robbing? This is Venice;</li>
  <li>My house is not a grange.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROD.">
  <li data-offset="5">Most grave Brabantio,</li>
  <li>In simple and pure soul I come to you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li>’Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not serve God, if the devil bid you. Because we come to do you service, and you think we are ruffians, you’ll have your daughter cover’d with a Barbary horse, you’ll have your nephews neigh to you; you’ll have coursers for cousins, and gennets for germans.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BRA.">
  <li data-number="110">What profane wretch art thou?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li>I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BRA.">
  <li>Thou art a villain.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li data-offset="4">You are a senator.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BRA.">
  <li>This thou shalt answer; I know thee, Roderigo.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROD.">
  <li>Sir, I will answer any thing. But I beseech you,</li>
  <li data-number="115">If’t be your pleasure and most wise consent</li>
  <li>(As partly I find it is) that your fair daughter,</li>
  <li>At this odd-even and dull watch o’ th’ night,</li>
  <li>Transported with no worse nor better guard</li>
  <li>But with a knave of common hire, a gundolier,</li>
  <li data-number="120">To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor—</li>
  <li>If this be known to you, and your allowance,</li>
  <li>We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs;</li>
  <li>But if you know not this, my manners tell me</li>
  <li>We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe</li>
  <li data-number="125">That, from the sense of all civility,</li>
  <li>I thus would play and trifle with your reverence.</li>
  <li>Your daughter (if you have not given her leave),</li>
  <li>I say again, hath made a gross revolt,</li>
  <li>Tying her duty, beauty, wit, and fortunes</li>
  <li data-number="130">In an extravagant and wheeling stranger</li>
  <li>Of here and every where. Straight satisfy yourself.</li>
  <li>If she be in her chamber or your house,</li>
  <li>Let loose on me the justice of the state</li>
  <li>For thus deluding you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BRA.">
  <li data-offset="4">Strike on the tinder, ho!</li>
  <li data-number="135">Give me a taper! Call up all my people!</li>
  <li>This accident is not unlike my dream,</li>
  <li>Belief of it oppresses me already.</li>
  <li>Light, I say, light!</li>

  <li data-offset="4">Farewell; for I must leave you.</li>
  <li>It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place,</li>
  <li data-number="140">To be producted (as, if I stay, I shall)</li>
  <li>Against the Moor; for I do know the state</li>
  <li>(How ever this may gall him with some check)</li>
  <li>Cannot with safety cast him, for he’s embark’d</li>
  <li>With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars</li>
  <li data-number="145">(Which even now stands in act) that, for their souls,</li>
  <li>Another of his fathom they have none</li>
  <li>To lead their business; in which regard,</li>
  <li>Though I do hate him as I do hell-pains,</li>
  <li>Yet, for necessity of present life,</li>
  <li data-number="150">I must show out a flag and sign of love,</li>
  <li>Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,</li>

  <li>It is too true an evil; gone she is;</li>

  <li>How didst thou know ’twas she?—O, she deceives me</li>

  <li>Though in the trade of war I have slain men,</li>

  <li>My very noble and approv’d good masters:</li>
  <li>That I have ta’en away this old man’s daughter,</li>
  <li>It is most true; true I have married her;</li>
  <li data-number="80">The very head and front of my offending</li>

  <li>And little of this great world can I speak</li>

  <li>In speaking for myself. Yet (by your gracious patience)</li>
  <li data-number="90">I will a round unvarnish’d tale deliver</li>
  <li>Of my whole course of love—what drugs, what charms,</li>
  <li>What conjuration, and what mighty magic</li>
  <li>(For such proceeding I am charg’d withal)</li>
  <li>I won his daughter.</li>

  <li>It is a judgment main’d, and most imperfect,</li>

  <li>She wish’d she had not heard it, yet she wish’d</li>

  <li>It is silliness to live, when to live is torment; and then have we a prescription to die, when death is our physician.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li>O villainous! I have look’d upon the world for four times seven years, and since I could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury, I never found man that knew how to love himself. Ere I would say I would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen, I would change my humanity with a baboon.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROD.">
  <li>What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so fond, but it is not in my virtue to amend it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li>Virtue? A fig! ’Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which our wills are gardeners; so that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up tine, supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with many, either to have it sterile with idleness or manur’d with industry—why, the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills. If the beam of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most prepost’rous conclusions. But we have reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal stings, our unbitted lusts; whereof I take this that you call love to be a sect or scion.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROD.">
  <li data-number="305">It cannot be.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li>It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will. Come, be a man! Drown thyself? Drown cats and blind puppies! I have profess’d me thy friend, and I confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness. I could never better stead thee than now. Put money in thy purse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favor with an usurp’d beard. I say put money in thy purse. It cannot be long that Desdemona should continue her love to the Moor—put money in thy purse—nor he his to her. It was a violent commencement in her, and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration—put but money in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in their wills—fill thy purse with money. The food that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be to him shortly as acerb as the coloquintida. She must change for youth; when she is sated with his body, she will find the error of her choice. She must have change, she must; therefore put money in thy purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money thou canst. If sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and a super-subtle Venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thou shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox of drowning thyself, it is clean out of the way. Seek thou rather to be hang’d in compassing thy joy than to be drown’d and go without her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROD.">
  <li>Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on the issue?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li>Thou art sure of me—go make money. I have told thee often, and I retell thee again and again, I hate the Moor. My cause is hearted; thine hath no less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him. If thou canst cuckold him, thou dost thyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are many events in the womb of time which will be deliver’d. Traverse, go, provide thy money. We will have more of this tomorrow. <foreign xml:lang="fr">Adieu</foreign>.</li>

  <li>Do thou meet me presently at the harbor.—Come hither. If thou be’st valiant (as they say base men being in love have then a nobility in their natures more than is native to them), list me. The lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guard. First, I must tell thee this: Desdemona is directly in love with him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROD.">
  <li>With him? Why, ’tis not possible.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li data-number="195">Lay thy finger thus; and let thy soul be instructed. Mark me with what violence she first lov’d the Moor, but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies. To love him still for prating—let not thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed; and what delight shall she have to look on the devil? When the blood is made dull with the act of sport, there should be, again to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favor, sympathy in years, manners, and beauties—all which the Moor is defective in. Now for want of these requir’d conveniences, her delicate tenderness will find itself abus’d, begin to heave the gorge, disrelish and abhor the Moor; very nature will instruct her in it and compel her to some second choice. Now, sir, this granted (as it is a most pregnant and unforc’d position), who stands so eminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does? A knave very voluble; no further conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming, for the better compass of his salt and most hidden loose affection? Why, none, why, none—a slipper and subtle knave, a finder-out of occasion; that has an eye can stamp and counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never present itself; a devilish knave. Besides, the knave is handsome, young, and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after; a pestilent complete knave, and the woman hath found him already.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROD.">
  <li>I cannot believe that in her, she’s full of most bless’d condition.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li>Bless’d fig’s-end! The wine she drinks is made of grapes. If she had been bless’d, she would never have lov’d the Moor. Bless’d pudding! Didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand? Didst not mark that?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROD.">
  <li>Yes, that I did; but that was but courtesy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li>Lechery, by this hand; an index and obscure prologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts. They met so near with their lips that their breaths embrac’d together. Villainous thoughts, Roderigo! When these mutualities so marshal the way, hard at hand comes the master and main exercise, th’ incorporate conclusion. Pish! But, sir, be you rul’d by me. I have brought you from Venice. Watch you tonight; for the command, I’ll lay’t upon you. Cassio knows you not. I’ll not be far from you. Do you find some occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking too loud, or tainting his discipline, or from what other course you please, which the time shall more favorably minister.</li>

  <li>Sir, he’s rash and very sudden in choler, and happily may strike at you—provoke him that he may; for even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to mutiny, whose qualification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of Cassio. So shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means I shall then have to prefer them; and the impediment most profitably remov’d, without the which there were no expectation of our prosperity.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROD.">
  <li>I will do this, if you can bring it to any opportunity.</li>

  <li>I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth</li>

  <li>And Cassio following him with determin’d sword</li>
  <li data-number="185">To execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman</li>
  <li>Steps in to Cassio and entreats his pause;</li>
  <li>Myself the crying fellow did pursue,</li>
  <li>Lest by his clamor (as it so fell out)</li>
  <li>The town might fall in fright. He, swift of foot,</li>
  <li data-number="190">Outran my purpose; and I return’d the rather</li>
  <li>For that I heard the clink and fall of swords,</li>
  <li>And Cassio high in oath; which till tonight</li>

  <li>(For this was brief), I found them close together</li>
  <li data-number="195">At blow and thrust, even as again they were</li>
  <li>When you yourself did part them.</li>
  <li>More of this matter cannot I report.</li>
  <li>But men are men; the best sometimes forget.</li>
  <li>Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,</li>
  <li data-number="200">As men in rage strike those that wish them best,</li>

  <li>Marry, God forbid!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAS.">
  <li>Reputation, reputation, reputation! O, I have lost my reputation! I have lost the immortal part of myself, and what remains is bestial. My reputation, Iago, my reputation!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li data-number="220">As I am an honest man, I had thought you had receiv’d some bodily wound; there is more sense in that than in reputation. Reputation is an idle and most false imposition; oft got without merit, and lost without deserving. You have lost no reputation at all, unless you repute yourself such a loser. What, man, there are more ways to recover the general again. You are but now cast in his mood, a punishment more in policy than in malice, even so as one would beat his offenseless dog to affright an imperious lion. Sue to him again, and he’s yours.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAS.">
  <li>I will rather sue to be despis’d than to deceive so good a commander with so slight, so drunken, and so indiscreet an officer. Drunk? And speak parrot? And squabble? Swagger? Swear? And discourse fustian with one’s own shadow? O thou invisible spirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be known by, let us call thee devil!</li>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li>What was he that you follow’d with your sword? What had he done to you?</li>

  <li>Is’t possible?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAS.">
  <li data-number="225">I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly; a quarrel, but nothing wherefore. O God, that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains! That we should, with joy, pleasance, revel, and applause, transform ourselves into beasts!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li>Why, but you are now well enough. How came you thus recover’d?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAS.">
  <li>It hath pleas’d the devil drunkenness to give place to the devil wrath: one unperfectness shows me another, to make me frankly despise myself.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li>Come, you are too severe a moraler. As the time, the place, and the condition of this country stands, I could heartily wish this had not befall’n; but since it is as it is, mend it for your own good.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAS.">
  <li>I will ask him for my place again, he shall tell me I am a drunkard! Had I as many mouths as Hydra, such an answer would stop them all. To be now a sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a beast! O strange! Every inordinate cup is unbless’d, and the ingredient is a devil.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li data-number="230">Come, come; good wine is a good familiar creature, if it be well us’d; exclaim no more against it. And, good lieutenant, I think you think I love you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAS.">
  <li>I have well approv’d it, sir. I drunk!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li>You, or any man living, may be drunk at a time, man. I’ll tell you what you shall do. Our general’s wife is now the general—I may say so in this respect, for that he hath devoted and given up himself to the contemplation, mark, and denotement of her parts and graces. Confess yourself freely to her; importune her help to put you in your place again. She is of so free, so kind, so apt, so bless’d a disposition, she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested. This broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter; and my fortunes against any lay worth naming, this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAS.">
  <li>You advise me well.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li>I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAS.">
  <li data-number="235">I think it freely; and betimes in the morning I will beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me. I am desperate of my fortunes if they check me here.</li>

  <li>Think’st thou I’d make a life of jealousy?</li>
  <li>To follow still the changes of the moon</li>

  <li data-number="185">To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,</li>
  <li>Is free of speech, sings, plays, and dances well;</li>
  <li>Where virtue is, these are more virtuous.</li>
  <li>Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw</li>
  <li>The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt,</li>
  <li data-number="190">For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago,</li>
  <li>I’ll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;</li>

  <li>I am glad of this, for now I shall have reason</li>

  <li>Look to your wife, observe her well with Cassio,</li>

  <li data-number="200">I would not have your free and noble nature,</li>

<ol data-speaker="OTH.">
  <li>Dost thou say so?</li>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li>She did deceive her father, marrying you,</li>

  <li data-number="185">Ay; and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li>Why, now I see there’s mettle in thee, and even from this instant do build on thee a better opinion than ever before. Give me thy hand, Roderigo. Thou hast taken against me a most just exception; but yet I protest I have dealt most directly in thy affair.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROD.">
  <li>It hath not appear’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li>I grant indeed it hath not appear’d; and your suspicion is not without wit and judgment. But, Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed, which I have greater reason to believe now than ever (I mean purpose, courage, and valor), this night show it. If thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona, take me from this world with treachery and devise engines for my life.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROD.">
  <li>Well; what is it? Is it within reason and compass?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li data-number="190">Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice to depute Cassio in Othello’s place.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROD.">
  <li>Is that true? Why then Othello and Desdemona return again to Venice.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li>O no; he goes into Mauritania and taketh away with him the fair Desdemona, unless his abode be ling’red here by some accident; wherein none can be so determinate as the removing of Cassio.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROD.">
  <li>How do you mean, removing him?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li>Why, by making him uncapable of Othello’s place: knocking out his brains.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROD.">
  <li data-number="195">And that you would have me to do?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li>Ay; if you dare do yourself a profit and a right. He sups tonight with a harlotry, and thither will I go to him—he knows not yet of his honorable fortune. If you will watch his going thence (which I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one), you may take him at your pleasure. I will be near to second your attempt, and he shall fall between us. Come, stand not amaz’d at it, but go along with me; I will show you such a necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to put it on him. It is now high supper-time, and the night grows to waste. About it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROD.">
  <li>I will hear further reason for this.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li>And you shall be satisfied.</li>

  <li>By my troth, I think I should, and undo’t when I had done’t.

  <li>Their wives have sense like them; they see, and smell,</li>
  <li>And have their palates both for sweet and sour,</li>
  <li data-number="85">As husbands have. What is it that they do</li>
  <li>When they change us for others? Is it sport?</li>
  <li>I think it is. And doth affection breed it?</li>
  <li>I think it doth. Is’t frailty that thus errs?</li>
  <li>It is so too. And have not we affections,</li>
  <li data-number="90">Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?</li>
  <li>Then let them use us well; else let them know,</li>
  <li>The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.</li>
