  <li data-number="5">So in the famous ancient city Tours,</li>

  <li>Seven earls, twelve barons, and twenty reverend bishops,</li>
  <li>I have perform’d my task, and was espous’d;</li>

  <li>In sight of England and her lordly peers,</li>
  <li>Deliver up my title in the Queen</li>

<ol data-speaker="KING.">
  <li>Suffolk, arise. Welcome, Queen Margaret,</li>
  <li>I can express no kinder sign of love</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING.">
  <li>Her sight did ravish, but her grace in speech,</li>
  <li>Her words yclad with wisdom’s majesty,</li>

  <li>Brave peers of England, pillars of the state,</li>
  <li>To you Duke Humphrey must unload his grief,</li>
  <li>Your grief, the common grief of all the land.</li>
  <li>What? Did my brother Henry spend his youth,</li>
  <li data-number="65">His valor, coin, and people, in the wars?</li>
  <li>Did he so often lodge in open field,</li>
  <li>In winter’s cold and summer’s parching heat,</li>
  <li>To conquer France, his true inheritance?</li>
  <li>And did my brother Bedford toil his wits,</li>
  <li data-number="70">To keep by policy what Henry got?</li>
  <li>Have you yourselves, Somerset, Buckingham,</li>
  <li>Brave York, Salisbury, and victorious Warwick,</li>
  <li>Receiv’d deep scars in France and Normandy?</li>
  <li>Or hath mine uncle Beauford and myself,</li>
  <li data-number="75">With all the learned Council of the realm,</li>
  <li>Studied so long, sat in the Council-house</li>
  <li>Early and late, debating to and fro</li>
  <li>How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe,</li>
  <li>And hath his Highness in his infancy</li>
  <li data-number="80">Crowned in Paris in despite of foes?</li>
  <li>And shall these labors and these honors die?</li>
  <li>Shall Henry’s conquest, Bedford’s vigilance,</li>
  <li>Your deeds of war, and all our counsel die?</li>
  <li>O peers of England, shameful is this league,</li>
  <li data-number="85">Fatal this marriage, cancelling your fame,</li>
  <li>Blotting your names from books of memory,</li>
  <li>Rasing the characters of your renown,</li>
  <li>Defacing monuments of conquer’d France,</li>
  <li>Undoing all, as all had never been!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAR.">
  <li data-number="90">Nephew, what means this passionate discourse,</li>
  <li>This peroration with such circumstance?</li>
  <li>For France, ’tis ours; and we will keep it still.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>Ay, uncle, we will keep it, if we can;</li>
  <li>But now it is impossible we should.</li>
  <li data-number="95">Suffolk, the new-made duke that rules the roast,</li>
  <li>Hath given the duchy of Anjou, and Maine,</li>
  <li>Unto the poor King Reignier, whose large style</li>
  <li>Agrees not with the leanness of his purse.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SAL.">
  <li>Now by the death of Him that died for all,</li>
  <li data-number="100">These counties were the keys of Normandy.</li>
  <li>But wherefore weeps Warwick, my valiant son?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WAR.">
  <li>For grief that they are past recovery;</li>
  <li>For were there hope to conquer them again,</li>
  <li>My sword should shed hot blood, mine eyes no tears.</li>
  <li data-number="105">Anjou and Maine? Myself did win them both.</li>
  <li>Those provinces these arms of mine did conquer,</li>
  <li>And are the cities that I got with wounds</li>
  <li>Deliver’d up again with peaceful words?</li>
  <li><foreign xml:lang="fr">Mort Dieu!</foreign></li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK.">
  <li data-number="110">For Suffolk’s duke, may he be suffocate,</li>
  <li>That dims the honor of this warlike isle!</li>
  <li>France should have torn and rent my very heart</li>
  <li>Before I would have yielded to this league.</li>
  <li>I never read but England’s kings have had</li>
  <li data-number="115">Large sums of gold and dowries with their wives,</li>
  <li>And our King Henry gives away his own,</li>
  <li>To match with her that brings no vantages.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>A proper jest, and never heard before,</li>
  <li>That Suffolk should demand a whole fifteenth</li>
  <li data-number="120">For costs and charges in transporting her!</li>
  <li>She should have stay’d in France, and starv’d in France,</li>
  <li>Before—</li>

  <li>My Lord of Gloucester, now ye grow too hot:</li>

  <li>I see thy fury. If I longer stay,</li>
  <li data-number="130">We shall begin our ancient bickerings.</li>

  <li>So, there goes our Protector in a rage.</li>
  <li>’Tis known to you he is mine enemy;</li>
  <li data-number="135">Nay more, an enemy unto you all,</li>
  <li>And no great friend, I fear me, to the King.</li>
  <li>Consider, lords, he is the next of blood,</li>
  <li>And heir-apparent to the English crown.</li>
  <li>Had Henry got an empire by his marriage,</li>
  <li data-number="140">And all the wealthy kingdoms of the west,</li>
  <li>There’s reason he should be displeas’d at it.</li>
  <li>Look to it, lords, let not his smoothing words</li>
  <li>Bewitch your hearts. Be wise and circumspect.</li>
  <li>What though the common people favor him,</li>
  <li data-number="145">Calling him “Humphrey, the good Duke of Gloucester,”</li>
  <li>Clapping their hands, and crying with loud voice,</li>
  <li>“Jesu maintain your royal Excellence!”</li>
  <li>With “God preserve the good Duke Humphrey!”</li>
  <li>I fear me, lords, for all this flattering gloss,</li>
  <li data-number="150">He will be found a dangerous Protector.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BUCK.">
  <li>Why should he then protect our sovereign,</li>
  <li>He being of age to govern of himself?</li>
  <li>Cousin of Somerset, join you with me,</li>

  <li data-number="155">We’ll quickly hoise Duke Humphrey from his seat.</li>

  <li>Pride went before, ambition follows him.</li>

  <li>Behooves it us to labor for the realm.</li>
  <li>I never saw but Humphrey Duke of Gloucester</li>
  <li data-number="170">Did bear him like a noble gentleman.</li>
  <li>Oft have I seen the haughty Cardinal,</li>
  <li>More like a soldier than a man o’ th’ church,</li>
  <li>As stout and proud as he were lord of all,</li>
  <li>Swear like a ruffian, and demean himself</li>

  <li>Warwick, my son, the comfort of my age,</li>

  <li>In this close walk to satisfy myself</li>
  <li>In craving your opinion of my title,</li>
  <li data-number="5">Which is infallible, to England’s crown.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SAL.">
  <li>My lord, I long to hear it at full.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WAR.">
  <li>Sweet York, begin; and if thy claim be good,</li>
  <li>The Nevils are thy subjects to command.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK.">
  <li>Then thus:</li>
  <li data-number="10">Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons:</li>
  <li>The first, Edward the Black Prince, Prince of Wales;</li>
  <li>The second, William of Hatfield; and the third,</li>
  <li>Lionel Duke of Clarence; next to whom</li>
  <li>Was John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster;</li>
  <li data-number="15">The fifth was Edmund Langley, Duke of York;</li>
  <li>The sixth was Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester;</li>
  <li>William of Windsor was the seventh and last.</li>
  <li>Edward the Black Prince died before his father,</li>
  <li>And left behind him Richard, his only son,</li>
  <li data-number="20">Who after Edward the Third’s death reign’d as king</li>
  <li>Till Henry Bullingbrook, Duke of Lancaster,</li>
  <li>The eldest son and heir of John of Gaunt,</li>
  <li>Crown’d by the name of Henry the Fourth,</li>
  <li>Seiz’d on the realm, depos’d the rightful king,</li>
  <li data-number="25">Sent his poor queen to France, from whence she came,</li>
  <li>And him to Pomfret; where, as all you know,</li>
  <li>Harmless Richard was murdered traitorously.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WAR.">
  <li>Father, the Duke hath told the truth;</li>
  <li>Thus got the house of Lancaster the crown.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK.">
  <li data-number="30">Which now they hold by force and not by right;</li>
  <li>For Richard, the first son’s heir, being dead,</li>
  <li>The issue of the next son should have reign’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SAL.">
  <li>But William of Hatfield died without an heir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK.">
  <li>The third son, Duke of Clarence, from whose line</li>
  <li data-number="35">I claim the crown, had issue, Philippe, a daughter,</li>
  <li>Who married Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March;</li>
  <li>Edmund had issue, Roger Earl of March;</li>
  <li>Roger had issue, Edmund, Anne, and Eleanor.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SAL.">
  <li>This Edmund, in the reign of Bullingbrook,</li>
  <li data-number="40">As I have read, laid claim unto the crown,</li>
  <li>And but for Owen Glendower, had been king,</li>
  <li>Who kept him in captivity till he died.</li>
  <li>But, to the rest.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK.">
  <li>His eldest sister, Anne,</li>
  <li data-number="45">My mother, being heir unto the crown,</li>
  <li>Married Richard Earl of Cambridge, who was</li>
  <li>To Edmund Langley, Edward the Third’s fifth son, son.</li>
  <li>By her I claim the kingdom. She was heir</li>
  <li>To Roger Earl of March, who was the son</li>
  <li data-number="50">Of Edmund Mortimer, who married Philippe,</li>
  <li>Sole daughter unto Lionel Duke of Clarence;</li>
  <li>So, if the issue of the elder son</li>
  <li>Succeed before the younger, I am king.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WAR.">
  <li>What plain proceedings is more plain than this?</li>
  <li data-number="55">Henry doth claim the crown from John of Gaunt,</li>
  <li>The fourth son, York claims it from the third;</li>
  <li>Till Lionel’s issue fails, his should not reign.</li>
  <li>It fails not yet, but flourishes in thee,</li>
  <li>And in thy sons, fair slips of such a stock.</li>
  <li data-number="60">Then, father Salisbury, kneel we together,</li>
  <li>And in this private plot be we the first</li>
  <li>That shall salute our rightful sovereign</li>
  <li>With honor of his birthright to the crown.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOTH. WAR. AND SAL.">
  <li>Long live our sovereign Richard, England’s king!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK.">
  <li data-number="65">We thank you, lords. But I am not your king</li>
  <li>Till I be crown’d, and that my sword be stain’d</li>
  <li>With heart-blood of the house of Lancaster;</li>
  <li>And that’s not suddenly to be perform’d,</li>
  <li>But with advice and silent secrecy.</li>
  <li data-number="70">Do you as I do in these dangerous days:</li>
  <li>Wink at the Duke of Suffolk’s insolence,</li>
  <li>At Beauford’s pride, at Somerset’s ambition,</li>
  <li>At Buckingham, and all the crew of them,</li>
  <li>Till they have snar’d the shepherd of the flock,</li>
  <li data-number="75">That virtuous prince, the good Duke Humphrey.</li>
  <li>’Tis that they seek; and they in seeking that</li>
  <li>Shall find their deaths, if York can prophesy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SAL.">
  <li>My lord, break we off; we know your mind at full.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WAR.">
  <li>My heart assures me that the Earl of Warwick</li>
  <li data-number="80">Shall one day make the Duke of York a king.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK.">
  <li>And, Nevil, this I do assure myself,</li>
  <li>Richard shall live to make the Earl of Warwick</li>
  <li>The greatest man in England but the King.</li>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN.">
  <li>Can you not see? Or will ye not observe</li>
  <li data-number="5">The strangeness of his alter’d countenance?</li>
  <li>With what a majesty he bears himself,</li>
  <li>How insolent of late he is become,</li>
  <li>How proud, how peremptory, and unlike himself?</li>
  <li>We know the time since he was mild and affable,</li>
  <li data-number="10">And if we did but glance a far-off look,</li>
  <li>Immediately he was upon his knee,</li>
  <li>That all the court admir’d him for submission;</li>
  <li>But meet him now, and, be it in the morn,</li>
  <li>When every one will give the time of day,</li>
  <li data-number="15">He knits his brow and shows an angry eye,</li>
  <li>And passeth by with stiff unbowed knee,</li>
  <li>Disdaining duty that to us belongs.</li>
  <li>Small curs are not regarded when they grin,</li>
  <li>But great men tremble when the lion roars,</li>
  <li data-number="20">And Humphrey is no little man in England.</li>
  <li>First note that he is near you in descent,</li>
  <li>And should you fall, he is the next will mount.</li>
  <li>Me seemeth then it is no policy,</li>
  <li>Respecting what a rancorous mind he bears</li>
  <li data-number="25">And his advantage following your decease,</li>
  <li>That he should come about your royal person,</li>
  <li>Or be admitted to your Highness’ Council.</li>
  <li>By flattery hath he won the commons’ hearts;</li>
  <li>And when he please to make commotion,</li>
  <li data-number="30">’Tis to be fear’d they all will follow him.</li>
  <li>Now ’tis the spring, and weeds are shallow-rooted;</li>
  <li>Suffer them now, and they’ll o’ergrow the garden,</li>
  <li>And choke the herbs for want of husbandry.</li>
  <li>The reverent care I bear unto my lord</li>
  <li data-number="35">Made me collect these dangers in the Duke.</li>
  <li>If it be fond, call it a woman’s fear;</li>
  <li>Which fear, if better reasons can supplant,</li>
  <li>I will subscribe, and say I wrong’d the Duke.</li>
  <li>My Lord of Suffolk, Buckingham, and York,</li>

  <li>Well hath your Highness seen into this duke;</li>
  <li>And, had I first been put to speak my mind,</li>
  <li>I think I should have told your Grace’s tale.</li>
  <li data-number="45">The Duchess by his subornation,</li>
  <li>Upon my life, began her devilish practices;</li>
  <li>Or if he were not privy to those faults,</li>
  <li>Yet, by reputing of his high descent,</li>
  <li>As next the King he was successive heir,</li>
  <li data-number="50">And such high vaunts of his nobility,</li>
  <li>Did instigate the bedlam brain-sick Duchess</li>
  <li>By wicked means to frame our sovereign’s fall.</li>
  <li>Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep,</li>
  <li>And in his simple show he harbors treason.</li>
  <li data-number="55">The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb.</li>
  <li>No, no, my sovereign, Gloucester is a man</li>
  <li>Unsounded yet and full of deep deceit.</li>

  <li>Why, ’tis well known that, whiles I was Protector,</li>

  <li>I take it kindly. Yet be well assur’d</li>

  <li>And undiscover’d come to me again,</li>
  <li data-number="370">And given me notice of their villainies.</li>
  <li>This devil here shall be my substitute;</li>
  <li>For that John Mortimer, which now is dead,</li>
  <li>In face, in gait, in speech, he doth resemble.</li>
  <li>By this I shall perceive the commons’ mind,</li>
  <li data-number="375">How they affect the house and claim of York.</li>
  <li>Say he be taken, rack’d, and tortured,</li>
  <li>I know no pain they can inflict upon him</li>
  <li>Will make him say I mov’d him to those arms.</li>
  <li>Say that he thrive, as ’tis great like he will,</li>
  <li data-number="380">Why then from Ireland come I with my strength,</li>
  <li>And reap the harvest which that rascal sow’d.</li>
  <li>For Humphrey being dead, as he shall be,</li>
  <li>And Henry put apart, the next for me.</li>

  <li>And in thy reverence, and thy chair-days, thus</li>
  <li data-number="50">To die in ruffian battle? Even at this sight</li>
  <li>My heart is turn’d to stone; and while ’tis mine,</li>
