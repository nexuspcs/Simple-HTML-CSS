<h3>Scene 1</h3>

<h4>London. An ante-chamber in the palace.</h4>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter the Duke of Norfolk at one door; at the other, the Duke of Buckingham and the Lord Abergavenny.

<ol data-speaker="BUCK.">
  <li>Good morrow, and well met. How have ye done</li>
  <li>Since last we saw in France?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NOR.">
  <li data-offset="6">I thank your Grace:</li>
  <li>Healthful, and ever since a fresh admirer</li>
  <li>Of what I saw there.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BUCK.">
  <li data-offset="4">An untimely ague</li>
  <li data-number="5">Stay’d me a prisoner in my chamber when</li>
  <li>Those suns of glory, those two lights of men,</li>
  <li>Met in the vale of Andren.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NOR.">
  <li data-offset="5">’Twixt Guynes and Arde—</li>
  <li>I was then present, saw them salute on horseback,</li>
  <li>Beheld them when they lighted, how they clung</li>
  <li data-number="10">In their embracement, as they grew together,</li>
  <li>Which had they, what four thron’d ones could have weigh’d</li>
  <li>Such a compounded one?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BUCK.">
  <li data-offset="5">All the whole time</li>
  <li>I was my chamber’s prisoner.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NOR.">
  <li data-offset="6">Then you lost</li>
  <li>The view of earthly glory. Men might say</li>
  <li data-number="15">Till this time pomp was single, but now married</li>
  <li>To one above itself. Each following day</li>
  <li>Became the next day’s master, till the last</li>
  <li>Made former wonders its. Today the French,</li>
  <li>All clinquant, all in gold, like heathen gods,</li>
  <li data-number="20">Shone down the English; and, tomorrow, they</li>
  <li>Made Britain India: every man that stood</li>
  <li>Show’d like a mine. Their dwarfish pages were</li>
  <li>As cherubins, all gilt; the madams too,</li>
  <li>Not us’d to toil, did almost sweat to bear</li>
  <li data-number="25">The pride upon them, that their very labor</li>
  <li>Was to them as a painting. Now this masque</li>
  <li>Was cried incomparable; and th’ ensuing night</li>
  <li>Made it a fool and beggar. The two kings,</li>
  <li>Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,</li>
  <li data-number="30">As presence did present them: him in eye</li>
  <li>Still him in praise, and being present both,</li>
  <li>’Twas said they saw but one, and no discerner</li>
  <li>Durst wag his tongue in censure. When these suns</li>
  <li>(For so they phrase ’em) by their heralds challeng’d</li>
  <li data-number="35">The noble spirits to arms, they did perform</li>
  <li>Beyond thought’s compass, that former fabulous story,</li>
  <li>Being now seen possible enough, got credit,</li>
  <li>That Bevis was believ’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BUCK.">
  <li data-offset="5">O, you go far.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NOR.">
  <li>As I belong to worship and affect</li>
  <li data-number="40">In honor honesty, the tract of ev’ry thing</li>
  <li>Would by a good discourser lose some life,</li>
  <li>Which action’s self was tongue to. All was royal;</li>
  <li>To the disposing of it nought rebell’d,</li>
  <li>Order gave each thing view; the office did</li>
  <li>Distinctly his full function.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BUCK.">
  <li data-number="45" data-offset="5">Who did guide—</li>
  <li>I mean, who set the body and the limbs</li>
  <li>Of this great sport together, as you guess?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NOR.">
  <li>One, certes, that promises no element</li>
  <li>In such a business.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BUCK.">
  <li data-offset="4">I pray you, who, my lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NOR.">
  <li data-number="50">All this was ord’red by the good discretion</li>
  <li>Of the right reverend Cardinal of York.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BUCK.">
  <li>The devil speed him! No man’s pie is freed</li>
  <li>From his ambitious finger. What had he</li>
  <li>To do in these fierce vanities? I wonder</li>
  <li data-number="55">That such a keech can with his very bulk</li>
  <li>Take up the rays o’ th’ beneficial sun,</li>
  <li>And keep it from the earth.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NOR.">
  <li data-offset="6">Surely, sir,</li>
  <li>There’s in him stuff that puts him to these ends;</li>
  <li>For being not propp’d by ancestry, whose grace</li>
  <li data-number="60">Chalks successors their way, nor call’d upon</li>
  <li>For high feats done to th’ crown, neither allied</li>
  <li>To eminent assistants, but spider-like</li>
  <li>Out of his self-drawing web, ’a gives us note</li>
  <li>The force of his own merit makes his way—</li>
  <li>A gift that heaven gives for him, which buys</li>
  <li>A place next to the King.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ABER.">
  <li data-offset="5">I cannot tell</li>
  <li>What heaven hath given him—let some graver eye</li>
  <li>Pierce into that—but I can see his pride</li>
  <li>Peep through each part of him. Whence has he that?</li>
  <li data-number="70">If not from hell, the devil is a niggard,</li>
  <li>Or has given all before, and he begins</li>
  <li>A new hell in himself.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BUCK.">
  <li data-offset="5">Why the devil,</li>
  <li>Upon this French going out, took he upon him</li>
  <li>(Without the privity o’ th’ King) t’ appoint</li>
  <li data-number="75">Who should attend on him? He makes up the file</li>
  <li>Of all the gentry; for the most part such</li>
  <li>To whom as great a charge as little honor</li>
  <li>He meant to lay upon; and his own letter,</li>
  <li>The honorable Board of Council out,</li>
  <li>Must fetch him in he papers.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ABER.">
  <li data-number="80" data-offset="6">I do know</li>
  <li>Kinsmen of mine, three at the least, that have</li>
  <li>By this so sicken’d their estates, that never</li>
  <li>They shall abound as formerly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BUCK.">
  <li data-offset="7">O, many</li>
  <li>Have broke their backs with laying manors on ’em</li>
  <li data-number="85">For this great journey. What did this vanity</li>
  <li>But minister communication of</li>
  <li>A most poor issue?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NOR.">
  <li data-offset="4">Grievingly I think</li>
  <li>The peace between the French and us not values</li>
  <li>The cost that did conclude it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BUCK.">
  <li data-offset="6">Every man,</li>
  <li data-number="90">After the hideous storm that follow’d, was</li>
  <li>A thing inspir’d, and, not consulting, broke</li>
  <li>Into a general prophecy: that this tempest,</li>
  <li>Dashing the garment of this peace, aboded</li>
  <li>The sudden breach on’t.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NOR.">
  <li data-offset="5">Which is budded out,</li>
  <li>For France hath flaw’d the league, and hath attach’d</li>
  <li>Our merchants’ goods at Bordeaux.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ABER.">
  <li data-offset="7">Is it therefore</li>
  <li>Th’ ambassador is silenc’d?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NOR.">
  <li data-offset="5">Marry, is’t.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ABER.">
  <li>A proper title of a peace, and purchas’d</li>
  <li>At a superfluous rate!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BUCK.">
  <li data-offset="4">Why, all this business</li>
  <li>Our reverend Cardinal carried.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NOR.">
  <li data-number="100" data-offset="6">Like it your Grace,</li>
  <li>The state takes notice of the private difference</li>
  <li>Betwixt you and the Cardinal. I advise you</li>
  <li>(And take it from a heart that wishes towards you</li>
  <li>Honor and plenteous safety) that you read</li>
  <li data-number="105">The Cardinal’s malice and his potency</li>
  <li>Together; to consider further, that</li>
  <li>What his high hatred would effect wants not</li>
  <li>A minister in his power. You know his nature,</li>
  <li>That he’s revengeful; and I know his sword</li>
  <li data-number="110">Hath a sharp edge; it’s long, and’t may be said</li>
  <li>It reaches far, and where ’twill not extend,</li>
  <li>Thither he darts it. Bosom up my counsel,</li>
  <li>You’ll find it wholesome. Lo, where comes that rock</li>
  <li>That I advise your shunning.</li>

  <li data-number="120">This butcher’s cur is venom’d-mouth’d, and I</li>
  <li>Have not the power to muzzle him, therefore best</li>
  <li>Not wake him in his slumber. A beggar’s book</li>
  <li>Outworths a noble’s blood.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NOR.">
  <li data-offset="5">What, are you chaf’d?</li>
  <li>Ask God for temp’rance, that’s th’ appliance only</li>
  <li>Which your disease requires.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BUCK.">
  <li data-number="125" data-offset="6">I read in ’s looks</li>
  <li>Matter against me, and his eye revil’d</li>
  <li>Me as his abject object; at this instant</li>
  <li>He bores me with some trick. He’s gone to th’ King;</li>
  <li>I’ll follow and outstare him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NOR.">
  <li data-offset="6">Stay, my lord,</li>
  <li data-number="130">And let your reason with your choler question</li>
  <li>What ’tis you go about: to climb steep hills</li>
  <li>Requires slow pace at first. Anger is like</li>
  <li>A full hot horse, who being allow’d his way,</li>
  <li>Self-mettle tires him. Not a man in England</li>
  <li>Can advise me like you; be to yourself</li>
  <li>As you would to your friend.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BUCK.">
  <li data-offset="6">I’ll to the King,</li>
  <li>And from a mouth of honor quite cry down</li>
  <li>This Ipswich fellow’s insolence; or proclaim</li>
  <li>There’s difference in no persons.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NOR.">
  <li data-offset="7">Be advis’d;</li>
  <li data-number="140">Heat not a furnace for your foe so hot</li>
  <li>That it do singe yourself. We may outrun</li>
  <li>By violent swiftness that which we run at,</li>
  <li>And lose by overrunning. Know you not</li>
  <li>The fire that mounts the liquor till’t run o’er</li>
  <li data-number="145">In seeming to augment it wastes it? Be advis’d;</li>
  <li>I say again, there is no English soul</li>
  <li>More stronger to direct you than yourself,</li>
  <li>If with the sap of reason you would quench,</li>
  <li>Or but allay, the fire of passion.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BUCK.">
  <li data-offset="7">Sir,</li>
  <li data-number="150">I am thankful to you, and I’ll go along</li>
  <li>By your prescription; but this top-proud fellow,</li>
  <li>Whom from the flow of gall I name not, but</li>
  <li>From sincere motions, by intelligence,</li>
  <li>And proofs as clear as founts in July when</li>
  <li>We see each grain of gravel, I do know</li>
  <li>To be corrupt and treasonous.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NOR.">
  <li data-offset="6">Say not treasonous.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BUCK.">
  <li>To th’ King I’ll say’t, and make my vouch as strong</li>
  <li>As shore of rock. Attend. This holy fox,</li>
  <li>Or wolf, or both (for he is equal rav’nous</li>
  <li data-number="160">As he is subtile, and as prone to mischief</li>
  <li>As able to perform’t), his mind and place</li>
  <li>Infecting one another, yea, reciprocally,</li>
  <li>Only to show his pomp as well in France</li>
  <li>As here at home, suggests the King our master</li>
  <li data-number="165">To this last costly treaty—th’ interview</li>
  <li>That swallowed so much treasure, and like a glass</li>
  <li>Did break i’ th’ wrenching.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NOR.">
  <li data-offset="5">Faith, and so it did.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BUCK.">
  <li>Pray give me favor, sir: this cunning Cardinal</li>
  <li>The articles o’ th’ combination drew</li>
  <li data-number="170">As himself pleas’d; and they were ratified</li>
  <li>As he cried, “Thus let be!” to as much end</li>
  <li>As give a crutch to th’ dead. But our count-cardinal</li>
  <li>Has done this, and ’tis well; for worthy Wolsey</li>
  <li>(Who cannot err), he did it. Now this follows</li>
  <li data-number="175">(Which, as I take it, is a kind of puppy</li>
  <li>To th’ old dam, treason), Charles the Emperor,</li>
  <li>Under pretense to see the Queen his aunt</li>
  <li>(For ’twas indeed his color, but he came</li>
  <li>To whisper Wolsey), here makes visitation—</li>
  <li data-number="180">His fears were that the interview betwixt</li>
  <li>England and France might through their amity</li>
  <li>Breed him some prejudice; for from this league</li>
  <li>Peep’d harms that menac’d him—privily</li>
  <li>Deals with our Cardinal, and, as I trow—</li>
  <li data-number="185">Which I do well, for I am sure the Emperor</li>
  <li>Paid ere he promis’d, whereby his suit was granted</li>
  <li>Ere it was ask’d—but when the way was made</li>
  <li>And pav’d with gold, the Emperor thus desir’d,</li>
  <li>That he would please to alter the King’s course,</li>
  <li data-number="190">And break the foresaid peace. Let the King know</li>
  <li>(As soon he shall by me) that thus the Cardinal</li>
  <li>Does buy and sell his honor as he pleases,</li>
  <li>And for his own advantage.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NOR.">
  <li data-offset="6">I am sorry</li>
  <li>To hear this of him; and could wish he were</li>
  <li>Something mistaken in’t.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BUCK.">
  <li data-number="195" data-offset="5">No, not a syllable:</li>
  <li>I do pronounce him in that very shape</li>

<ol data-speaker="Q. KATH.">
  <li data-offset="4">I am much too venturous</li>
  <li data-number="55">In tempting of your patience; but am bold’ned</li>
  <li>Under your promis’d pardon. The subject’s grief</li>
  <li>Comes through commissions, which compels from each</li>
  <li>The sixth part of his substance, to be levied</li>
  <li>Without delay; and the pretense for this</li>
  <li data-number="60">Is nam’d, your wars in France. This makes bold mouths,</li>
  <li>Tongues spit their duties out, and cold hearts freeze</li>
  <li>Allegiance in them; their curses now</li>

  <li>This tractable obedience is a slave</li>

  <li>The chronicles of my doing, let me say</li>
  <li data-number="75">’Tis but the fate of place, and the rough brake</li>
  <li>That virtue must go through. We must not stint</li>
  <li>Our necessary actions in the fear</li>
  <li>To cope malicious censurers, which ever,</li>
  <li>As rav’nous fishes, do a vessel follow</li>
  <li data-number="80">That is new trimm’d, but benefit no further</li>

<ol data-speaker="KING.">
  <li data-number="110" data-offset="5">It grieves many.</li>
  <li>The gentleman is learn’d, and a most rare speaker,</li>
  <li>To nature none more bound; his training such</li>
  <li>That he may furnish and instruct great teachers</li>
  <li>And never seek for aid out of himself. Yet see,</li>
  <li data-number="115">When these so noble benefits shall prove</li>
  <li>Not well dispos’d, the mind growing once corrupt,</li>
  <li>They turn to vicious forms, ten times more ugly</li>
  <li>Than ever they were fair. This man so complete,</li>
  <li>Who was enroll’d ’mongst wonders, and when we,</li>
  <li data-number="120">Almost with ravish’d list’ning, could not find</li>
  <li>His hour of speech a minute—he, my lady,</li>
  <li>Hath into monstrous habits put the graces</li>
  <li>That once were his, and is become as black</li>
  <li>As if besmear’d in hell. Sit by us, you shall hear</li>
  <li data-number="125">(This was his gentleman in trust) of him</li>
  <li>Things to strike honor sad. Bid him recount</li>
  <li>The fore-recited practices, whereof</li>
  <li>We cannot feel too little, hear too much.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WOL.">
  <li>Stand forth, and with bold spirit relate what you,</li>
  <li>Most like a careful subject, have collected</li>
  <li>Out of the Duke of Buckingham.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING.">
  <li data-offset="7">Speak freely.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BUCK. SURV.">
  <li>First, it was usual with him—every day</li>
  <li>It would infect his speech—that if the King</li>
  <li>Should without issue die, he’ll carry it so</li>
  <li data-number="135">To make the sceptre his. These very words</li>
  <li>I’ve heard him utter to his son-in-law,</li>
  <li>Lord Aburga’ny, to whom by oath he menac’d</li>
  <li>Revenge upon the Cardinal.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WOL.">
  <li data-offset="5">Please your Highness note</li>
  <li>This dangerous conception in this point,</li>
  <li data-number="140">Not friended by his wish, to your high person;</li>
  <li>His will is most malignant, and it stretches</li>
  <li>Beyond you to your friends.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Q. KATH.">
  <li data-offset="6">My learn’d Lord Cardinal,</li>
  <li>Deliver all with charity.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING.">
  <li data-offset="5">Speak on.</li>
  <li>How grounded he his title to the crown</li>
  <li>Upon our fail? To this point hast thou heard him</li>
  <li>At any time speak aught?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BUCK. SURV.">
  <li data-offset="5">He was brought to this</li>
  <li>By a vain prophecy of Nicholas Henton.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING.">
  <li>What was that Henton?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BUCK. SURV.">
  <li data-offset="5">Sir, a Chartreux friar,</li>
  <li>His confessor, who fed him every minute</li>
  <li>With words of sovereignty.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING.">
  <li data-number="150" data-offset="5">How know’st thou this?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BUCK. SURV.">
  <li>Not long before your Highness sped to France,</li>
  <li>The Duke being at the Rose, within the parish</li>
  <li>Saint Lawrence Poultney, did of me demand</li>
  <li>What was the speech among the Londoners</li>
  <li data-number="155">Concerning the French journey. I replied,</li>
  <li>Men fear the French would prove perfidious,</li>
  <li>To the King’s danger. Presently the Duke</li>
  <li>Said, ’twas the fear indeed, and that he doubted</li>
  <li>’Twould prove the verity of certain words</li>
  <li data-number="160">Spoke by a holy monk “that oft,” says he,</li>
  <li>“Hath sent to me, wishing me to permit</li>
  <li>John de la Car, my chaplain, a choice hour</li>
  <li>To hear from him a matter of some moment;</li>
  <li>Whom after under the confession’s seal</li>
  <li data-number="165">He solemnly had sworn that what he spoke</li>
  <li>My chaplain to no creature living but</li>
  <li>To me should utter, with demure confidence</li>
  <li>This pausingly ensu’d: ‘Neither the King nor ’s heirs</li>
  <li>(Tell you the Duke) shall prosper. Bid him strive</li>
  <li>To the love o’ th’ commonalty; the Duke</li>
  <li>Shall govern England.’”</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Q. KATH.">
  <li data-offset="5">If I know you well,</li>
  <li>You were the Duke’s surveyor, and lost your office</li>
  <li>On the complaint o’ th’ tenants. Take good heed</li>
  <li>You charge not in your spleen a noble person</li>
  <li>And spoil your nobler soul; I say, take heed;</li>
  <li>Yes, heartily beseech you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING.">
  <li data-offset="5">Let him on.</li>
  <li>Go forward.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BUCK. SURV.">
  <li data-offset="3">On my soul, I’ll speak but truth.</li>
  <li>I told my lord the Duke, by th’ devil’s illusions</li>
  <li>The monk might be deceiv’d, and that ’twas dangerous for him</li>
  <li data-number="180">To ruminate on this so far, until</li>
  <li>It forg’d him some design, which being believ’d,</li>
  <li>It was much like to do. He answer’d, “Tush,</li>
  <li>It can do me no damage”; adding further</li>
  <li>That had the King in his last sickness fail’d,</li>
  <li>The Cardinal’s and Sir Thomas Lovell’s heads</li>
  <li>Should have gone off.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING.">
  <li data-offset="5">Ha? What, so rank? Ah ha,</li>
  <li>There’s mischief in this man. Canst thou say further?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BUCK. SURV.">
  <li>I can, my liege.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING.">
  <li data-offset="3">Proceed.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BUCK. SURV.">
  <li data-offset="5">Being at Greenwich,</li>
  <li>After your Highness had reprov’d the Duke</li>
  <li>About Sir William Bulmer—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING.">
  <li data-number="190" data-offset="6">I remember</li>
  <li>Of such a time, being my sworn servant,</li>
  <li>The Duke retain’d him his. But on; what hence?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BUCK. SURV.">
  <li>“If,” quoth he, “I for this had been committed—</li>
  <li>As to the Tower, I thought—I would have play’d</li>
  <li data-number="195">The part my father meant to act upon</li>
  <li>Th’ usurper Richard, who, being at Salisbury,</li>
  <li>Made suit to come in ’s presence; which if granted,</li>
  <li>As he made semblance of his duty would</li>
  <li>Have put his knife into him.”</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING.">
  <li data-offset="6">A giant traitor!</li>

<ol data-speaker="WOL.">
  <li>Now, madam, may his Highness live in freedom,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING.">
  <li>There’s something more would out of thee; what say’st?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BUCK. SURV.">
  <li>After “the Duke his father,” with the “knife,”</li>
  <li>He stretch’d him, and with one hand on his dagger,</li>
  <li data-number="205">Another spread on ’s breast, mounting his eyes,</li>
  <li>He did discharge a horrible oath, whose tenor</li>
  <li>Was, were he evil us’d, he would outgo</li>
  <li>His father by as much as a performance</li>
  <li>Does an irresolute purpose.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING.">
  <li data-offset="5">There’s his period,</li>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter two Gentlemen at several doors.
	
		BOTH. 1. GENT. AND 2. GENT.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="1. GENT.">
  <li>Whither away so fast?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. GENT.">
  <li data-offset="5">O, God save ye!</li>
  <li>Ev’n to the hall, to hear what shall become</li>
  <li>Of the great Duke of Buckingham.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. GENT.">
  <li data-offset="7">I’ll save you</li>
  <li>That labor, sir. All’s now done but the ceremony</li>
  <li>Of bringing back the prisoner.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. GENT.">
  <li data-offset="6">Were you there?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. GENT.">
  <li>Yes indeed was I.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. GENT.">
  <li data-offset="4">Pray speak what has happen’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. GENT.">
  <li>You may guess quickly what.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. GENT.">
  <li data-offset="6">Is he found guilty?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. GENT.">
  <li>Yes, truly is he, and condemn’d upon’t.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. GENT.">
  <li>I am sorry for’t.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. GENT.">
  <li data-offset="3">So are a number more.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. GENT.">
  <li data-number="10">But pray how pass’d it?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. GENT.">
  <li>I’ll tell you in a little. The great Duke</li>
  <li>Came to the bar; where to his accusations</li>
  <li>He pleaded still not guilty, and alleged</li>
  <li>Many sharp reasons to defeat the law.</li>
  <li data-number="15">The King’s attorney on the contrary</li>
  <li>Urg’d on the examinations, proofs, confessions</li>
  <li>Of divers witnesses, which the Duke desir’d</li>
  <li>To him brought <foreign xml:lang="la">vivâ voce</foreign> to his face;</li>
  <li>At which appear’d against him his surveyor,</li>
  <li data-number="20">Sir Gilbert Perk his chancellor, and John Car,</li>
  <li>Confessor to him, with that devil monk,</li>
  <li>Hopkins, that made this mischief.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. GENT.">
  <li data-offset="7">That was he</li>
  <li>That fed him with his prophecies?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. GENT.">
  <li data-offset="7">The same;</li>
  <li>All these accus’d him strongly, which he fain</li>
  <li data-number="25">Would have flung from him; but indeed he could not.</li>
  <li>And so his peers upon this evidence</li>
  <li>Have found him guilty of high treason. Much</li>
  <li>He spoke, and learnedly, for life; but all</li>
  <li>Was either pitied in him or forgotten.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. GENT.">
  <li data-number="30">After all this, how did he bear himself?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. GENT.">
  <li>When he was brought again to th’ bar, to hear</li>
  <li>His knell rung out, his judgment, he was stirr’d</li>
  <li>With such an agony he sweat extremely,</li>
  <li>And something spoke in choler, ill, and hasty.</li>
  <li data-number="35">But he fell to himself again, and sweetly</li>
  <li>In all the rest show’d a most noble patience.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. GENT.">
  <li>I do not think he fears death.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. GENT.">
  <li data-offset="6">Sure he does not,</li>
  <li>He never was so womanish. The cause</li>
  <li>He may a little grieve at.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. GENT.">
  <li data-offset="5">Certainly</li>
  <li>The Cardinal is the end of this.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. GENT.">
  <li data-number="40" data-offset="7">’Tis likely,</li>
  <li>By all conjectures: first, Kildare’s attendure,</li>
  <li>Then deputy of Ireland, who remov’d,</li>
  <li>Earl Surrey was sent thither, and in haste too,</li>
  <li>Lest he should help his father.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. GENT.">
  <li data-offset="6">That trick of state</li>
  <li>Was a deep envious one.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. GENT.">
  <li data-number="45" data-offset="5">At his return</li>
  <li>No doubt he will requite it. This is noted,</li>
  <li>And generally, whoever the King favors,</li>
  <li>The Card’nal instantly will find employment,</li>
  <li>And far enough from court too.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. GENT.">
  <li data-offset="7">All the commons</li>
  <li data-number="50">Hate him perniciously, and, o’ my conscience,</li>

  <li>I have this day receiv’d a traitor’s judgment,</li>
  <li>And by that name must die; yet, heaven bear witness,</li>
  <li data-number="60">And if I have a conscience, let it sink me,</li>
  <li>Even as the axe falls, if I be not faithful!</li>
  <li>The law I bear no malice for my death;</li>
  <li>’T has done, upon the premises, but justice;</li>
  <li>But those that sought it I could wish more Christians.</li>
  <li data-number="65">Be what they will, I heartily forgive ’em;</li>
  <li>Yet let ’em look they glory not in mischief,</li>
  <li>Nor build their evils on the graves of great men,</li>
  <li>For then my guiltless blood must cry against ’em.</li>
  <li>For further life in this world I ne’er hope,</li>
  <li data-number="70">Nor will I sue, although the King have mercies</li>
  <li>More than I dare make faults. You few that lov’d me</li>
  <li>And dare be bold to weep for Buckingham,</li>
  <li>His noble friends and fellows, whom to leave</li>
  <li>Is only bitter to him, only dying,</li>
  <li data-number="75">Go with me like good angels to my end,</li>
  <li>And as the long divorce of steel falls on me,</li>
  <li>Make of your prayers one sweet sacrifice,</li>
  <li>And lift my soul to heaven. Lead on a’ God’s name.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LOV.">
  <li>I do beseech your Grace, for charity,</li>
  <li data-number="80">If ever any malice in your heart</li>
  <li>Were hid against me, now to forgive me frankly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BUCK.">
  <li>Sir Thomas Lovell, I as free forgive you</li>
  <li>As I would be forgiven. I forgive all.</li>
  <li>There cannot be those numberless offenses</li>
  <li data-number="85">’Gainst me, that I cannot take peace with; no black envy</li>
  <li>Shall make my grave. Commend me to his Grace;</li>
  <li>And if he speak of Buckingham, pray tell him</li>
  <li>You met him half in heaven. My vows and prayers</li>
  <li>Yet are the King’s; and, till my soul forsake,</li>
  <li data-number="90">Shall cry for blessings on him. May he live</li>
  <li>Longer than I have time to tell his years;</li>
  <li>Ever belov’d and loving may his rule be;</li>
  <li>And when old Time shall lead him to his end,</li>
  <li>Goodness and he fill up one monument!</li>

<ol data-speaker="LOV.">
  <li data-number="95">To th’ water side I must conduct your Grace;</li>

<ol data-speaker="BUCK.">
  <li data-number="100" data-offset="6">Nay, Sir Nicholas,</li>
  <li>Let it alone; my state now will but mock me.</li>
  <li>When I came hither, I was Lord High Constable</li>
  <li>And Duke of Buckingham; now, poor Edward Bohun.</li>
  <li>Yet I am richer than my base accusers,</li>
  <li data-number="105">That never knew what truth meant. I now seal it;</li>
  <li>And with that blood will make ’em one day groan for’t.</li>
  <li>My noble father, Henry of Buckingham,</li>
  <li>Who first rais’d head against usurping Richard,</li>
  <li>Flying for succor to his servant Banister,</li>
  <li data-number="110">Being distress’d, was by that wretch betray’d,</li>
  <li>And without trial fell; God’s peace be with him!</li>
  <li>Henry the Seventh succeeding, truly pitying</li>
  <li>My father’s loss, like a most royal prince</li>
  <li>Restor’d me to my honors; and out of ruins</li>
  <li data-number="115">Made my name once more noble. Now his son,</li>
  <li>Henry the Eight, life, honor, name, and all</li>
  <li>That made me happy, at one stroke has taken</li>
  <li>Forever from the world. I had my trial,</li>
  <li>And must needs say a noble one; which makes me</li>
  <li data-number="120">A little happier than my wretched father.</li>
  <li>Yet thus far we are one in fortunes: both</li>
  <li>Fell by our servants, by those men we lov’d most;</li>
  <li>A most unnatural and faithless service.</li>
  <li>Heaven has an end in all; yet, you that hear me,</li>
  <li data-number="125">This from a dying man receive as certain:</li>
  <li>Where you are liberal of your loves and counsels,</li>
  <li>Be sure you be not loose; for those you make friends</li>
  <li>And give your hearts to, when they once perceive</li>
  <li>The least rub in your fortunes, fall away</li>
  <li data-number="130">Like water from ye, never found again</li>
  <li>But where they mean to sink ye. All good people,</li>
  <li>Pray for me! I must now forsake ye. The last hour</li>
  <li>Of my long weary life is come upon me.</li>
  <li>Farewell!</li>

<ol data-speaker="Q. KATH.">
  <li>Sir, I desire you do me right and justice,</li>
  <li>And to bestow your pity on me; for</li>
  <li>I am a most poor woman, and a stranger,</li>
  <li>Born out of your dominions; having here</li>
  <li data-number="15">No judge indifferent, nor no more assurance</li>
  <li>Of equal friendship and proceeding. Alas, sir!</li>
  <li>In what have I offended you? What cause</li>
  <li>Hath my behavior given to your displeasure,</li>
  <li>That thus you should proceed to put me off,</li>
  <li data-number="20">And take your good grace from me? Heaven witness,</li>
  <li>I have been to you a true and humble wife,</li>
  <li>At all times to your will conformable;</li>
  <li>Ever in fear to kindle your dislike,</li>
  <li>Yea, subject to your countenance—glad, or sorry,</li>
  <li data-number="25">As I saw it inclin’d. When was the hour</li>
  <li>I ever contradicted your desire?</li>
  <li>Or made it not mine too? Or which of your friends</li>
  <li>Have I not strove to love, although I knew</li>
  <li>He were mine enemy? What friend of mine</li>
  <li data-number="30">That had to him deriv’d your anger did I</li>
  <li>Continue in my liking? Nay, gave notice</li>
  <li>He was from thence discharg’d? Sir, call to mind</li>
  <li>That I have been your wife in this obedience</li>
  <li>Upward of twenty years, and have been blest</li>
  <li data-number="35">With many children by you. If, in the course</li>
  <li>And process of this time, you can report,</li>
  <li>And prove it too, against mine honor aught—</li>
  <li>My bond to wedlock or my love and duty,</li>
  <li>Against your sacred person—in God’s name</li>
  <li data-number="40">Turn me away; and let the foul’st contempt</li>
  <li>Shut door upon me, and so give me up</li>
  <li>To the sharp’st kind of justice. Please you, sir,</li>
  <li>The King your father was reputed for</li>
  <li>A prince most prudent, of an excellent</li>
  <li data-number="45">And unmatch’d wit and judgment; Ferdinand,</li>
  <li>My father, King of Spain, was reckon’d one</li>
  <li>The wisest prince that there had reign’d by many</li>
  <li>A year before. It is not to be question’d</li>
  <li>That they had gather’d a wise council to them</li>
  <li data-number="50">Of every realm, that did debate this business,</li>
  <li>Who deem’d our marriage lawful; wherefore I humbly</li>
  <li>Beseech you, sir, to spare me, till I may</li>
  <li>Be by my friends in Spain advis’d, whose counsel</li>
  <li>I will implore. If not, i’ th’ name of God,</li>
  <li>Your pleasure be fulfill’d!</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Q. KATH.">
  <li>I will, when you are humble; nay, before,</li>
  <li>Or God will punish me. I do believe</li>
  <li>(Induc’d by potent circumstances) that</li>
  <li data-number="75">You are mine enemy, and make my challenge</li>
  <li>You shall not be my judge; for it is you</li>

  <li>O’ertopping woman’s pow’r. Madam, you do me wrong,</li>
  <li>I have no spleen against you, nor injustice</li>
  <li>For you or any. How far I have proceeded,</li>
  <li>Or how far further shall, is warranted</li>
  <li data-number="90">By a commission from the consistory,</li>

  <li>The King is present: if it be known to him</li>
  <li>That I gainsay my deed, how may he wound,</li>
  <li data-number="95">And worthily, my falsehood! Yea, as much</li>
  <li>As you have done my truth. If he know</li>
  <li>That I am free of your report, he knows</li>
  <li>I am not of your wrong. Therefore in him</li>
  <li>It lies to cure me, and the cure is to</li>
  <li data-number="100">Remove these thoughts from you; the which before</li>
  <li>His Highness shall speak in, I do beseech</li>
  <li>You, gracious madam, to unthink your speaking</li>

<ol data-speaker="KING.">
  <li data-offset="6">My Lord Cardinal,</li>
  <li>I do excuse you; yea, upon mine honor,</li>
  <li data-number="155">I free you from’t. You are not to be taught</li>
  <li>That you have many enemies, that know not</li>
  <li>Why they are so, but, like to village curs,</li>
  <li>Bark when their fellows do: by some of these</li>
  <li>The Queen is put in anger. Y’ are excus’d;</li>
  <li data-number="160">But will you be more justified? You ever</li>
  <li>Have wish’d the sleeping of this business, never desir’d</li>
  <li>It to be stirr’d; but oft have hind’red, oft,</li>
  <li>The passages made toward it. On my honor,</li>
  <li>I speak my good Lord Card’nal to this point,</li>
  <li data-number="165">And thus far clear him. Now, what mov’d me to’t,</li>
  <li>I will be bold with time and your attention:</li>
  <li>Then mark th’ inducement. Thus it came; give heed to’t:</li>
  <li>My conscience first receiv’d a tenderness,</li>
  <li>Scruple, and prick, on certain speeches utter’d</li>
  <li data-number="170">By th’ Bishop of Bayonne, then French ambassador,</li>
  <li>Who had been hither sent on the debating</li>
  <li>A marriage ’twixt the Duke of Orléans and</li>
  <li>Our daughter Mary. I’ th’ progress of this business,</li>
  <li>Ere a determinate resolution, he</li>
  <li data-number="175">(I mean the Bishop) did require a respite,</li>
  <li>Wherein he might the King his lord advertise</li>
  <li>Whether our daughter were legitimate,</li>
  <li>Respecting this our marriage with the dowager,</li>
  <li>Sometimes our brother’s wife. This respite shook</li>
  <li data-number="180">The bosom of my conscience, enter’d me,</li>
  <li>Yea, with a spitting power, and made to tremble</li>
  <li>The region of my breast, which forc’d such way,</li>
  <li>That many maz’d considerings did throng</li>
  <li>And press’d in with this caution. First, methought</li>
  <li data-number="185">I stood not in the smile of heaven, who had</li>
  <li>Commanded nature, that my lady’s womb,</li>
  <li>If it conceiv’d a male-child by me, should</li>
  <li>Do no more offices of life to’t than</li>
  <li>The grave does to th’ dead; for her male issue</li>
  <li data-number="190">Or died where they were made, or shortly after</li>
  <li>This world had air’d them. Hence I took a thought</li>
  <li>This was a judgment on me, that my kingdom</li>
  <li>(Well worthy the best heir o’ th’ world) should not</li>
  <li>Be gladded in’t by me. Then follows, that</li>
  <li data-number="195">I weigh’d the danger which my realms stood in</li>
  <li>By this my issue’s fail, and that gave to me</li>
  <li>Many a groaning throe. Thus hulling in</li>
  <li>The wild sea of my conscience, I did steer</li>
  <li>Toward this remedy, whereupon we are</li>
  <li data-number="200">Now present here together: that’s to say,</li>
  <li>I meant to rectify my conscience—which</li>
  <li>I then did feel full sick, and yet not well—</li>
  <li>By all the reverend fathers of the land</li>
  <li>And doctors learn’d. First I began in private</li>
  <li data-number="205">With you, my Lord of Lincoln. You remember</li>
  <li>How under my oppression I did reek</li>
  <li>When I first mov’d you.</li>

  <li>I left no reverend person in this court;</li>
  <li>But by particular consent proceeded</li>
  <li data-number="220">Under your hands and seals. Therefore go on,</li>
  <li>For no dislike i’ th’ world against the person</li>

  <li>Upon my soul, two reverend cardinal virtues;</li>
  <li>But cardinal sins and hollow hearts I fear ye.</li>
  <li data-number="105">Mend ’em for shame, my lords! Is this your comfort?</li>
  <li>The cordial that ye bring a wretched lady,</li>
  <li>A woman lost among ye, laugh’d at, scorn’d?</li>
  <li>I will not wish ye half my miseries,</li>
  <li>I have more charity. But say I warn’d ye;</li>

  <li>Alas, h’as banish’d me his bed already,</li>
  <li data-number="120">His love, too long ago! I am old, my lords,</li>

  <li>Never yet branded with suspicion?</li>
  <li>Have I with all my full affections</li>
  <li data-number="130">Still met the King? Lov’d him next heav’n? Obey’d him?</li>
  <li>Been, out of fondness, superstitious to him?</li>

  <li>Bring me a constant woman to her husband,</li>

  <li>I am the most unhappy woman living.</li>
  <li>Alas, poor wenches, where are now your fortunes?</li>
  <li>Shipwrack’d upon a kingdom, where no pity,</li>
  <li data-number="150">No friends, no hope, no kindred weep for me,</li>
  <li>Almost no grave allow’d me. Like the lily,</li>
  <li>That once was mistress of the field, and flourish’d,</li>

  <li>The way of our profession is against it;</li>
  <li>We are to cure such sorrows, not to sow ’em.</li>
  <li>For goodness sake, consider what you do,</li>
  <li data-number="160">How you may hurt yourself—ay, utterly</li>
  <li>Grow from the King’s acquaintance, by this carriage.</li>
  <li>The hearts of princes kiss obedience,</li>
  <li>So much they love it; but to stubborn spirits</li>
  <li>They swell and grow, as terrible as storms.</li>
  <li data-number="165">I know you have a gentle, noble temper,</li>

  <li>Those we profess, peacemakers, friends, and servants.</li>

<ol data-speaker="CAM.">
  <li>Madam, you’ll find it so. You wrong your virtues</li>
  <li>With these weak women’s fears. A noble spirit</li>
  <li data-number="170">As yours was put into you, ever casts</li>
  <li>Such doubts, as false coin, from it. The King loves you,</li>
  <li>Beware you lose it not. For us (if you please</li>

  <li>To make a seemly answer to such persons.</li>
  <li>Pray do my service to his Majesty;</li>
  <li data-number="180">He has my heart yet and shall have my prayers</li>

  <li>If you will now unite in your complaints,</li>

  <li data-offset="5">Which of the peers</li>

  <li>Out of himself?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CHAM.">
  <li data-offset="3">My lords, you speak your pleasures.</li>
  <li>What he deserves of you and me I know;</li>
  <li data-number="15">What we can do to him (though now the time</li>
  <li>Gives way to us) I much fear. If you cannot</li>
  <li>Bar his access to th’ King, never attempt</li>
  <li>Any thing on him; for he hath a witchcraft</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NOR.">
  <li data-offset="5">O, fear him not,</li>
  <li data-number="20">His spell in that is out. The King hath found</li>
  <li>Matter against him that forever mars</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SUR.">
  <li data-offset="8">Sir,</li>
  <li>I should be glad to hear such news as this</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NOR.">
  <li data-number="25" data-offset="4">Believe it, this is true.</li>
  <li>In the divorce his contrary proceedings</li>

  <li data-offset="6">How came</li>

  <li data-offset="4">Most strangely.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SUR.">
  <li data-offset="8">O how? How?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SUF.">
  <li data-number="30">The Cardinal’s letters to the Pope miscarried,</li>
  <li>And came to th’ eye o’ th’ King, wherein was read</li>
  <li>How that the Cardinal did entreat his Holiness</li>
  <li>To stay the judgment o’ th’ divorce; for if</li>
  <li>It did take place, “I do,” quoth he, “perceive</li>
  <li data-number="35">My king is tangled in affection to</li>
  <li>A creature of the Queen’s, Lady Anne Bullen.”</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SUR.">
  <li>Has the King this?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SUF.">
  <li data-offset="4">Believe it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SUR.">
  <li data-offset="6">Will this work?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CHAM.">
  <li>The King in this perceives him, how he coasts</li>
  <li>And hedges his own way. But in this point</li>
  <li data-number="40">All his tricks founder, and he brings his physic</li>
  <li>After his patient’s death. The King already</li>
  <li>Hath married the fair lady.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SUR.">
  <li data-offset="7">Would he had!</li>

  <li>There’s order given for her coronation.</li>

  <li>To some ears unrecounted. But, my lords,</li>
  <li>She is a gallant creature, and complete</li>
  <li data-number="50">In mind and feature. I persuade me, from her</li>

  <li>Has left the cause o’ th’ King unhandled, and</li>
  <li>Is posted, as the agent of our Cardinal,</li>
  <li>To second all his plot. I do assure you</li>
  <li>The King cried “Ha!” at this.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CHAM.">
  <li data-offset="6">Now God incense him,</li>

  <li data-offset="6">But, my lord,</li>
  <li>When returns Cranmer?</li>

  <li>He is return’d in his opinions, which</li>
  <li data-number="65">Have satisfied the King for his divorce,</li>
  <li>Together with all famous colleges</li>
  <li>Almost in Christendom. Shortly, I believe,</li>
  <li>His second marriage shall be publish’d, and</li>
  <li>Her coronation. Katherine no more</li>
  <li>Shall be call’d Queen, but Princess Dowager</li>
  <li>And widow to Prince Arthur.</li>

  <li>Among the crowd i’ th’ Abbey, where a finger</li>

<ol data-speaker="2. GENT.">
  <li data-offset="4">Good sir, speak it to us.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="3. GENT.">
  <li>As well as I am able. The rich stream</li>
  <li>Of lords and ladies, having brought the Queen</li>
  <li>To a prepar’d place in the choir, fell off</li>
  <li data-number="65">A distance from her; while her Grace sate down</li>
  <li>To rest a while, some half an hour or so,</li>
  <li>In a rich chair of state, opposing freely</li>
  <li>The beauty of her person to the people.</li>
  <li>Believe me, sir, she is the goodliest woman</li>
  <li data-number="70">That ever lay by man—which when the people</li>
  <li>Had the full view of, such a noise arose</li>
  <li>As the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest,</li>
  <li>As loud and to as many tunes. Hats, cloaks</li>
  <li>(Doublets, I think) flew up, and had their faces</li>
  <li data-number="75">Been loose, this day they had been lost. Such joy</li>
  <li>I never saw before. Great-bellied women,</li>
  <li>That had not half a week to go, like rams</li>
  <li>In the old time of war, would shake the press</li>
  <li>And make ’em reel before ’em. No man living</li>
  <li>Could say, “This is my wife” there, all were woven</li>
  <li>So strangely in one piece.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. GENT.">
  <li data-offset="5">But what follow’d?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="3. GENT.">
  <li>At length her Grace rose, and with modest paces</li>
  <li>Came to the altar, where she kneel’d, and saint-like</li>
  <li>Cast her fair eyes to heaven, and pray’d devoutly;</li>
  <li data-number="85">Then rose again and bow’d her to the people;</li>
  <li>When by the Archbishop of Canterbury</li>
  <li>She had all the royal makings of a queen,</li>
  <li>As holy oil, Edward Confessor’s crown,</li>
  <li>The rod, and bird of peace, and all such emblems</li>
  <li data-number="90">Laid nobly on her; which perform’d, the choir,</li>
  <li>With all the choicest music of the kingdom,</li>
  <li>Together sung <foreign xml:lang="la">Te Deum</foreign>. So she parted,</li>
  <li>And with the same full state pac’d back again</li>
  <li>To York-place, where the feast is held.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. GENT.">
  <li data-offset="8">Sir,</li>
  <li data-number="95">You must no more call it York-place, that’s past;</li>
  <li>For since the Cardinal fell that title’s lost.</li>
  <li>’Tis now the King’s, and call’d Whitehall.</li>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Katherine, Dowager, sick, led between Griffith, her Gentleman Usher, and Patience, her woman.
	
		KATH.
		GRIF.
		PAT.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="GRIF.">
  <li>How does your Grace?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KATH.">
  <li data-offset="5">O Griffith, sick to death!</li>
  <li>My legs like loaden branches bow to th’ earth,</li>
  <li>Willing to leave their burden. Reach a chair.</li>
  <li>So; now, methinks, I feel a little ease.</li>
  <li data-number="5">Didst thou not tell me, Griffith, as thou ledst me,</li>
  <li>That the great child of honor, Cardinal Wolsey,</li>
  <li>Was dead?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRIF.">
  <li data-offset="2">Yes, madam; but I think your Grace,</li>
  <li>Out of the pain you suffer’d, gave no ear to’t.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KATH.">
  <li>Prithee, good Griffith, tell me how he died.</li>
  <li>If well, he stepp’d before me happily</li>
  <li>For my example.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRIF.">
  <li data-offset="4">Well, the voice goes, madam:</li>
  <li>For after the stout Earl Northumberland</li>
  <li>Arrested him at York, and brought him forward,</li>
  <li>As a man sorely tainted, to his answer,</li>
  <li>He fell sick suddenly and grew so ill</li>
  <li>He could not sit his mule.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KATH.">
  <li data-offset="5">Alas, poor man!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRIF.">
  <li>At last, with easy roads, he came to Leicester,</li>
  <li>Lodg’d in the abbey; where the reverend abbot</li>
  <li>With all his covent honorably receiv’d him;</li>
  <li data-number="20">To whom he gave these words; “O Father Abbot,</li>
  <li>An old man, broken with the storms of state,</li>
  <li>Is come to lay his weary bones among ye;</li>
  <li>Give him a little earth for charity!”</li>
  <li>So went to bed; where eagerly his sickness</li>
  <li data-number="25">Pursu’d him still, and three nights after this,</li>
  <li>About the hour of eight, which he himself</li>
  <li>Foretold should be his last, full of repentance,</li>
  <li>Continual meditations, tears, and sorrows,</li>
  <li>He gave his honors to the world again,</li>
  <li data-number="30">His blessed part to heaven, and slept in peace.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KATH.">
  <li>So may he rest, his faults lie gently on him!</li>
  <li>Yet thus far, Griffith, give me leave to speak him,</li>
  <li>And yet with charity. He was a man</li>
  <li>Of an unbounded stomach, ever ranking</li>
  <li data-number="35">Himself with princes; one that by suggestion</li>
  <li>Tied all the kingdom. Simony was fair play;</li>
  <li>His own opinion was his law. I’ th’ presence</li>
  <li>He would say untruths, and be ever double</li>
  <li>Both in his words and meaning. He was never</li>
  <li data-number="40">(But where he meant to ruin) pitiful.</li>
  <li>His promises were, as he then was, mighty;</li>
  <li>But his performance, as he is now, nothing.</li>
  <li>Of his own body he was ill, and gave</li>
  <li>The clergy ill example.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRIF.">
  <li data-offset="5">Noble madam,</li>
  <li data-number="45">Men’s evil manners live in brass, their virtues</li>
  <li>We write in water. May it please your Highness</li>
  <li>To hear me speak his good now?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KATH.">
  <li data-offset="7">Yes, good Griffith,</li>
  <li>I were malicious else.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRIF.">
  <li data-offset="4">This Cardinal,</li>
  <li>Though from an humble stock, undoubtedly</li>
  <li data-number="50">Was fashion’d to much honor. From his cradle</li>
  <li>He was a scholar, and a ripe and good one;</li>
  <li>Exceeding wise, fair-spoken, and persuading;</li>
  <li>Lofty and sour to them that lov’d him not,</li>
  <li>But to those men that sought him, sweet as summer.</li>
  <li data-number="55">And though he were unsatisfied in getting</li>
  <li>(Which was a sin), yet in bestowing, madam,</li>
  <li>He was most princely: ever witness for him</li>
  <li>Those twins of learning that he rais’d in you,</li>
  <li>Ipswich and Oxford! One of which fell with him,</li>
  <li data-number="60">Unwilling to outlive the good that did it;</li>
  <li>The other (though unfinish’d) yet so famous,</li>
  <li>So excellent in art, and still so rising,</li>
  <li>That Christendom shall ever speak his virtue.</li>
  <li>His overthrow heap’d happiness upon him;</li>
  <li data-number="65">For then, and not till then, he felt himself,</li>
  <li>And found the blessedness of being little;</li>
  <li>And to add greater honors to his age</li>
  <li>Than man could give him, he died fearing God.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KATH.">
  <li>After my death I wish no other herald,</li>
  <li data-number="70">No other speaker of my living actions</li>
  <li>To keep mine honor from corruption,</li>
  <li>But such an honest chronicler as Griffith.</li>
  <li>Whom I most hated living, thou hast made me,</li>
  <li>With thy religious truth and modesty,</li>
  <li data-number="75">Now in his ashes honor. Peace be with him!</li>
  <li>Patience, be near me still, and set me lower;</li>
  <li>I have not long to trouble thee. Good Griffith,</li>
  <li>Cause the musicians play me that sad note</li>
  <li>I nam’d my knell, whilst I sit meditating</li>
  <li data-number="80">On that celestial harmony I go to.</li>

	They first congee unto her, then dance; and, at certain changes, the first two hold a spare garland over her head, at which the other four make reverend curtsies. Then the two that held the garland deliver the same to the other next two, who observe the same order in their changes, and holding the garland over her head; which done, they deliver the same garland to the last two, who likewise observe the same order; at which (as it were by inspiration) she makes (in her sleep) signs of rejoicing, and holdeth up her hands to heaven: and so in their dancing vanish, carrying the garland with them.

  <li>(For so I know he is, they know he is)</li>

<ol data-speaker="CHAN.">
  <li>My good Lord Archbishop, I’m very sorry</li>
  <li>To sit here at this present, and behold</li>
  <li data-number="45">That chair stand empty; but we all are men,</li>
  <li>In our own natures frail, and capable</li>
  <li>Of our flesh; few are angels; out of which frailty</li>
  <li>And want of wisdom, you, that best should teach us,</li>
  <li>Have misdemean’d yourself, and not a little:</li>
  <li data-number="50">Toward the King first, then his laws, in filling</li>
  <li>The whole realm by your teaching and your chaplains’</li>
  <li>(For so we are inform’d) with new opinions,</li>
  <li>Divers and dangerous; which are heresies,</li>
  <li>And, not reform’d, may prove pernicious.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BISH. WIN.">
  <li data-number="55">Which reformation must be sudden too,</li>
  <li>My noble lords; for those that tame wild horses</li>
  <li>Pace ’em not in their hands to make ’em gentle,</li>
  <li>But stop their mouths with stubborn bits and spur ’em</li>
  <li>Till they obey the manage. If we suffer,</li>
  <li data-number="60">Out of our easiness and childish pity</li>
  <li>To one man’s honor, this contagious sickness,</li>
  <li>Farewell all physic! And what follows then?</li>
  <li>Commotions, uproars, with a general taint</li>
  <li>Of the whole state; as of late days our neighbors,</li>
  <li data-number="65">The upper Germany, can dearly witness,</li>
  <li>Yet freshly pitied in our memories.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRAN.">
  <li>My good lords: hitherto, in all the progress</li>
  <li>Both of my life and office, I have labor’d,</li>
  <li>And with no little study, that my teaching</li>
  <li data-number="70">And the strong course of my authority</li>
  <li>Might go one way, and safely; and the end</li>
  <li>Was ever to do well; nor is there living</li>
  <li>(I speak it with a single heart, my lords)</li>
  <li>A man that more detests, more stirs against,</li>
  <li data-number="75">Both in his private conscience and his place,</li>
  <li>Defacers of a public peace than I do.</li>
  <li>Pray heaven the King may never find a heart</li>
  <li>With less allegiance in it! Men that make</li>
  <li>Envy and crooked malice nourishment</li>
  <li data-number="80">Dare bite the best. I do beseech your lordships,</li>
  <li>That, in this case of justice, my accusers,</li>
  <li>Be what they will, may stand forth face to face,</li>
  <li>And freely urge against me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SUF.">
  <li data-offset="6">Nay, my lord,</li>
  <li>That cannot be; you are a Councillor,</li>
  <li data-number="85">And by that virtue no man dare accuse you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BISH. WIN.">
  <li>My lord, because we have business of more moment,</li>
  <li>We will be short with you. ’Tis his Highness’ pleasure</li>
  <li>And our consent, for better trial of you,</li>
  <li>From hence you be committed to the Tower,</li>
  <li data-number="90">Where being but a private man again,</li>
  <li>You shall know many dare accuse you boldly,</li>
  <li>More than (I fear) you are provided for.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRAN.">
  <li>Ah, my good Lord of Winchester—I thank you,</li>
  <li>You are always my good friend; if your will pass,</li>
  <li data-number="95">I shall both find your lordship judge and juror,</li>
  <li>You are so merciful. I see your end,</li>
  <li>’Tis my undoing. Love and meekness, lord,</li>
  <li>Become a churchman better than ambition;</li>
  <li>Win straying souls with modesty again,</li>
  <li data-number="100">Cast none away. That I shall clear myself,</li>
  <li>Lay all the weight ye can upon my patience,</li>
  <li>I make as little doubt as you do conscience</li>
  <li>In doing daily wrongs. I could say more,</li>
  <li>But reverence to your calling makes me modest.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BISH. WIN.">
  <li data-number="105">My lord, my lord, you are a sectary,</li>
  <li>That’s the plain truth. Your painted gloss discovers,</li>
  <li>To men that understand you, words and weakness.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CROM.">
  <li>My Lord of Winchester, y’ are a little,</li>
  <li>By your good favor, too sharp; men so noble,</li>
  <li data-number="110">However faulty, yet should find respect</li>
  <li>For what they have been. ’Tis a cruelty</li>
  <li>To load a falling man.</li>
</ol>

There was a haberdasher’s wife of small wit near him, that rail’d upon me till her pink’d porringer fell off her head, for kindling such a combustion in the state. I miss’d the meteor once, and hit that woman, who cried out “Clubs!” , when I might see from far some forty truncheoners draw to her succor, which were the hope o’ th’ Strond, where she was quarter’d. They fell on, I made good my place; at length they came to th’ broom-staff to me, I defied ’em still, when suddenly a file of boys behind ’em, loose shot, deliver’d such a show’r of pebbles, that I was fain to draw mine honor in, and let ’em win the work.

  <li>And all that shall succeed. Saba was never</li>
  <li>More covetous of wisdom and fair virtue</li>
  <li>Than this pure soul shall be. All princely graces</li>
  <li>That mould up such a mighty piece as this is,</li>
  <li data-number="25">With all the virtues that attend the good,</li>
  <li>Shall still be doubled on her. Truth shall nurse her,</li>
  <li>Holy and heavenly thoughts still counsel her.</li>
  <li>She shall be lov’d and fear’d: her own shall bless her;</li>
  <li>Her foes shake like a field of beaten corn,</li>
  <li data-number="30">And hang their heads with sorrow. Good grows with her;</li>
  <li>In her days every man shall eat in safety</li>
  <li>Under his own vine what he plants, and sing</li>
  <li>The merry songs of peace to all his neighbors.</li>
  <li>God shall be truly known, and those about her</li>
  <li data-number="35">From her shall read the perfect ways of honor,</li>
  <li>And by those claim their greatness, not by blood.</li>
  <li>Nor shall this peace sleep with her; but as when</li>
  <li>The bird of wonder dies, the maiden phoenix,</li>
  <li>Her ashes new create another heir</li>
  <li data-number="40">As great in admiration as herself,</li>
  <li>So shall she leave her blessedness to one</li>
  <li>(When heaven shall call her from this cloud of darkness)</li>
  <li>Who from the sacred ashes of her honor</li>
  <li>Shall star-like rise as great in fame as she was,</li>
  <li data-number="45">And so stand fix’d. Peace, plenty, love, truth, terror,</li>
  <li>That were the servants to this chosen infant,</li>
  <li>Shall then be his, and like a vine grow to him.</li>
  <li>Where ever the bright sun of heaven shall shine,</li>
  <li>His honor and the greatness of his name</li>
  <li data-number="50">Shall be, and make new nations. He shall flourish,</li>
  <li>And like a mountain cedar reach his branches</li>
  <li>To all the plains about him. Our children’s children</li>
  <li>Shall see this, and bless heaven.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING.">
  <li data-offset="7">Thou speakest wonders.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRAN.">
  <li>She shall be, to the happiness of England,</li>
  <li data-number="55">An aged princess; many days shall see her,</li>
  <li>And yet no day without a deed to crown it.</li>
  <li>Would I had known no more! But she must die,</li>
  <li>She must, the saints must have her; yet a virgin,</li>
  <li>A most unspotted lily shall she pass</li>
  <li data-number="60">To th’ ground, and all the world shall mourn her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING.">
  <li>O Lord Archbishop,</li>
  <li>Thou hast made me now a man! Never, before</li>
  <li>This happy child, did I get any thing.</li>
  <li>This oracle of comfort has so pleas’d me</li>
  <li data-number="65">That when I am in heaven I shall desire</li>
  <li>To see what this child does, and praise my Maker.</li>
  <li>I thank ye all. To you, my good Lord Mayor,</li>
  <li>And you, good brethren, I am much beholding;</li>
  <li>I have receiv’d much honor by your presence,</li>
  <li data-number="70">And ye shall find me thankful. Lead the way, lords,</li>
  <li>Ye must all see the Queen, and she must thank ye,</li>
  <li>She will be sick else. This day, no man think</li>
  <li>H’as business at his house; for all shall stay:</li>
  <li>This little one shall make it Holy-day.</li>
