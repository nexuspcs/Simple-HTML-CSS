  <li>Now for the love of him whom Jove hath mark’d</li>
  <li data-number="30">The honor of your bed, and for the sake</li>
  <li>Of clear virginity, be advocate</li>
  <li>For us and our distresses! This good deed</li>

  <li>We are three queens, whose sovereigns fell before</li>
  <li data-number="40">The wrath of cruel Creon; who endured</li>
  <li>The beaks of ravens, talents of the kites,</li>
  <li>And pecks of crows in the foul fields of Thebes.</li>
  <li>He will not suffer us to bum their bones,</li>
  <li>To urn their ashes, nor to take th’ offense</li>
  <li data-number="45">Of mortal loathsomeness from the blest eye</li>
  <li>Of holy Phoebus, but infects the winds</li>
  <li>With stench of our slain lords. O, pity, Duke,</li>
  <li>Thou purger of the earth, draw thy fear’d sword</li>
  <li>That does good turns to th’ world; give us the bones</li>
  <li data-number="50">Of our dead kings, that we may chapel them;</li>
  <li>And of thy boundless goodness take some note</li>
  <li>That for our crowned heads we have no roof,</li>
  <li>Save this which is the lion’s, and the bear’s,</li>
  <li>And vault to every thing!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="THE.">
  <li data-offset="5">Pray you kneel not;</li>
  <li data-number="55">I was transported with your speech, and suffer’d</li>
  <li>Your knees to wrong themselves. I have heard the fortunes</li>
  <li>Of your dead lords, which gives me such lamenting</li>
  <li>As wakes my vengeance and revenge for ’em.</li>
  <li>King Capaneus was your lord. The day</li>
  <li data-number="60">That he should marry you, at such a season</li>
  <li>As now it is with me, I met your groom</li>
  <li>By Mars’s altar. You were that time fair;</li>
  <li>Not Juno’s mantle fairer than your tresses,</li>
  <li>Nor in more bounty spread her. Your wheaten wreath</li>
  <li data-number="65">Was then nor thresh’d nor blasted; Fortune at you</li>
  <li>Dimpled her cheek with smiles. Hercules our kinsman</li>
  <li>(Then weaker than your eyes) laid by his club;</li>
  <li>He tumbled down upon his Nemean hide,</li>
  <li>And swore his sinews thaw’d. O grief and time,</li>
  <li data-number="70">Fearful consumers, you will all devour!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. QUEEN.">
  <li>O, I hope some god,</li>
  <li>Some god hath put his mercy in your manhood,</li>

  <li>Our undertaker.</li>

  <li>You cannot read it there. There, through my tears,</li>

  <li>You may behold ’em. Lady, lady, alack!</li>
  <li>He that will all the treasure know o’ th’ earth</li>
  <li data-number="115">Must know the centre too; he that will fish</li>
  <li>For my least minnow, let him lead his line</li>
  <li>To catch one at my heart. O, pardon me,</li>

  <li data-number="125">Being a natural sister of our sex,</li>
  <li>Your sorrow beats so ardently upon me</li>
  <li>That it shall make a counter-reflect ’gainst</li>

<ol data-speaker="1. QUEEN.">
  <li data-offset="5">O, this celebration</li>
  <li>Will long last and be more costly than</li>
  <li>Your suppliants’ war! Remember that your fame</li>
  <li>Knolls in the ear o’ th’ world; what you do quickly</li>
  <li data-number="135">Is not done rashly; your first thought is more</li>
  <li>Than others’ labored meditance; your premeditating</li>
  <li>More than their actions. But, O Jove, your actions,</li>
  <li>Soon as they move, as asprays do the fish,</li>
  <li>Subdue before they touch. Think, dear Duke, think</li>
  <li>What beds our slain kings have!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. QUEEN.">
  <li data-offset="7">What griefs our beds</li>
  <li>That our dear lords have none!</li>

  <li>And were good kings when living.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="THE.">
  <li>It is true; and I will give you comfort</li>
  <li>To give your dead lords graves; the which to do</li>
  <li data-number="150">Must make some work with Creon.</li>

<ol data-speaker="1. QUEEN.">
  <li>And that work presents itself to th’ doing:</li>

<ol data-speaker="ARC.">
  <li>Dear Palamon, dearer in love than blood,</li>
  <li>And our prime cousin, yet unhard’ned in</li>
  <li>The crimes of nature—let us leave the city</li>
  <li>Thebes, and the temptings in’t, before we further</li>
  <li data-number="5">Sully our gloss of youth:</li>
  <li>And here to keep in abstinence we shame</li>
  <li>As in incontinence; for not to swim</li>
  <li>I’ th’ aid o’ th’ current were almost to sink,</li>
  <li>At least to frustrate striving, and to follow</li>
  <li data-number="10">The common stream, ’twould bring us to an eddy</li>
  <li>Where we should turn or drown; if labor through,</li>
  <li>Our gain but life and weakness.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAL.">
  <li data-offset="7">Your advice</li>
  <li>Is cried up with example. What strange ruins,</li>
  <li>Since first we went to school, may we perceive</li>
  <li data-number="15">Walking in Thebes! Scars and bare weeds</li>
  <li>The gain o’ th’ martialist, who did propound</li>
  <li>To his bold ends honor and golden ingots,</li>
  <li>Which though he won, he had not; and now flurted</li>
  <li>By peace, for whom he fought, who then shall offer</li>
  <li data-number="20">To Mars’s so scorn’d altar? I do bleed</li>
  <li>When such I meet, and wish great Juno would</li>
  <li>Resume her ancient fit of jealousy</li>
  <li>To get the soldier work, that peace might purge</li>
  <li>For her repletion, and retain anew</li>
  <li>Her charitable heart, now hard, and harsher</li>
  <li>Than strife or war could be.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARC.">
  <li data-offset="6">Are you not out?</li>
  <li>Meet you no ruin but the soldier in</li>
  <li>The cranks and turns of Thebes? You did begin</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAL.">
  <li data-offset="6">Yes, I pity</li>

  <li>Hath a good color; where ev’ry seeming good’s</li>
  <li data-number="40">A certain evil; where not to be ev’n jump</li>

<ol data-speaker="PAL.">
  <li data-offset="7">’Tis in our power</li>
  <li>(Unless we fear that apes can tutor’s) to</li>
  <li>Be masters of our manners. What need I</li>
  <li data-number="45">Affect another’s gait, which is not catching</li>
  <li>Where there is faith? Or to be fond upon</li>
  <li>Another’s way of speech, when by mine own</li>
  <li>I may be reasonably conceiv’d; sav’d too,</li>
  <li>Speaking it truly? Why am I bound</li>
  <li data-number="50">By any generous bond to follow him</li>
  <li>Follows his tailor, haply so long until</li>
  <li>The follow’d make pursuit? Or let me know</li>
  <li>Why mine own barber is unblest, with him</li>
  <li>My poor chin too, for ’tis not scissor’d just</li>
  <li data-number="55">To such a favorite’s glass? What canon is there</li>
  <li>That does command my rapier from my hip,</li>
  <li>To dangle’t in my hand, or to go tiptoe</li>
  <li>Before the street be foul? Either I am</li>
  <li>The forehorse in the team, or I am none</li>
  <li data-number="60">That draw i’ th’ sequent trace. These poor slight sores</li>

  <li data-number="25" data-offset="6">No, Palamon,</li>
  <li>Those hopes are prisoners with us. Here we are,</li>
  <li>And here the graces of our youths must wither</li>
  <li>Like a too-timely spring. Here age must find us,</li>
  <li>And which is heaviest, Palamon, unmarried.</li>
  <li data-number="30">The sweet embraces of a loving wife,</li>
  <li>Loaden with kisses, arm’d with thousand Cupids,</li>
  <li>Shall never clasp our necks; no issue know us;</li>
  <li>No figures of ourselves shall we ev’r see</li>
  <li>To glad our age, and like young eagles teach ’em</li>
  <li data-number="35">Boldly to gaze against bright arms, and say,</li>
  <li>“Remember what your fathers were, and conquer!”</li>
  <li>The fair-ey’d maids shall weep our banishments,</li>
  <li>And in their songs curse ever-blinded Fortune</li>
  <li>Till she for shame see what a wrong she has done</li>
  <li data-number="40">To youth and nature. This is all our world:</li>
  <li>We shall know nothing here but one another,</li>
  <li>Hear nothing but the clock that tells our woes;</li>
  <li>The vine shall grow, but we shall never see it;</li>
  <li>Summer shall come, and with her all delights,</li>
  <li data-number="45">But dead-cold winter must inhabit here still.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAL.">
  <li>’Tis too true, Arcite. To our Theban hounds,</li>
  <li>That shook the aged forest with their echoes,</li>
  <li>No more now must we hallow; no more shake</li>
  <li>Our pointed javelins, whilst the angry swine</li>
  <li data-number="50">Flies like a Parthian quiver from our rages,</li>
  <li>Struck with our well-steel’d darts. All valiant uses</li>
  <li>(The food and nourishment of noble minds)</li>
  <li>In us two here shall perish; we shall die</li>
  <li>(Which is the curse of honor) lastly</li>
  <li>Children of grief and ignorance.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARC.">
  <li data-number="55" data-offset="7">Yet, cousin,</li>
  <li>Even from the bottom of these miseries,</li>
  <li>From all that fortune can inflict upon us,</li>
  <li>I see two comforts rising, two mere blessings,</li>
  <li>If the gods please—to hold here a brave patience,</li>
  <li data-number="60">And the enjoying of our griefs together.</li>
  <li>Whilst Palamon is with me, let me perish</li>
  <li>If I think this our prison.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAL.">
  <li data-offset="5">Certainly</li>
  <li>’Tis a main goodness, cousin, that our fortunes</li>
  <li>Were twin’d together. ’Tis most true, two souls</li>
  <li data-number="65">Put in two noble bodies, let ’em suffer</li>
  <li>The gall of hazard, so they grow together,</li>
  <li>Will never sink; they must not, say they could;</li>
  <li>A willing man dies sleeping, and all’s done.</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAL.">
  <li data-number="70" data-offset="6">How, gentle cousin?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARC.">
  <li>Let’s think this prison holy sanctuary</li>
  <li>To keep us from corruption of worse men.</li>
  <li>We are young and yet desire the ways of honor,</li>
  <li>That liberty and common conversation,</li>
  <li data-number="75">The poison of pure spirits, might, like women,</li>
  <li>Woo us to wander from. What worthy blessing</li>
  <li>Can be, but our imaginations</li>
  <li>May make it ours? And here being thus together,</li>
  <li>We are an endless mine to one another;</li>
  <li data-number="80">We are one another’s wife, ever begetting</li>
  <li>New births of love; we are father, friends, acquaintance;</li>
  <li>We are, in one another, families:</li>
  <li>I am your heir, and you are mine; this place</li>
  <li>Is our inheritance. No hard oppressor</li>
  <li data-number="85">Dare take this from us; here with a little patience</li>
  <li>We shall live long, and loving. No surfeits seek us;</li>
  <li>The hand of war hurts none here, nor the seas</li>
  <li>Swallow their youth. Were we at liberty,</li>
  <li>A wife might part us lawfully, or business,</li>
  <li data-number="90">Quarrels consume us, envy of ill men</li>
  <li>Crave our acquaintance; I might sicken, cousin,</li>
  <li>Where you should never know it, and so perish</li>
  <li>Without your noble hand to close mine eyes,</li>
  <li>Or prayers to the gods. A thousand chances,</li>
  <li>Were we from hence, would sever us.</li>

<ol data-speaker="PAL.">
  <li data-number="95" data-offset="8">You have made me</li>

  <li>It is to live abroad, and every where!</li>
  <li>’Tis like a beast, methinks. I find the court here,</li>
  <li data-number="100">I am sure, a more content, and all those pleasures</li>
  <li>That woo the wills of men to vanity</li>
  <li>I see through now, and am sufficient</li>
  <li>To tell the world ’tis but a gaudy shadow</li>
  <li>That old Time, as he passes by, takes with him.</li>
  <li data-number="105">What had we been, old in the court of Creon,</li>
  <li>Where sin is justice, lust and ignorance</li>

  <li>I reck not if the wolves would jaw me, so</li>

  <li>I cannot hallow. If I whoop’d, what then?</li>
  <li data-number="10">If he not answer’d, I should call a wolf,</li>
  <li>And do him but that service. I have heard</li>

  <li>Myself to beg, if I priz’d life so much</li>

  <li>Food took I none these two days—</li>

  <li data-number="30">Lest I should drown, or stab, or hang myself.</li>
  <li>O state of nature, fail together in me,</li>

  <li>The best way is, the next way to a grave;</li>
  <li>Each errant step beside is torment. Lo</li>

  <li data-number="220">And not kill one another? Every day</li>
  <li>They’ld fight about you; hourly bring your honor</li>
  <li>In public question with their swords. Be wise then</li>
  <li>And here forget ’em; it concerns your credit</li>
  <li>And my oath equally. I have said they die;</li>
  <li>Better they fall by th’ law than one another.</li>
  <li>Bow not my honor.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EMIL.">
  <li data-offset="4">O my noble brother,</li>
  <li>That oath was rashly made, and in your anger,</li>
  <li>Your reason will not hold it. If such vows</li>

  <li data-number="230">Beside, I have another oath ’gainst yours,</li>
  <li>Of more authority, I am sure more love,</li>

  <li>Think how you maim your honor</li>
  <li>(For now I am set a-begging, sir, I am deaf</li>

  <li data-number="240">Might breed the ruin of my name; opinion,</li>
  <li>Shall any thing that loves me perish for me?</li>
  <li>That were a cruel wisdom. Do men proin</li>
  <li>The straight young boughs that blush with thousand blossoms,</li>
  <li>Because they may be rotten? O Duke Theseus,</li>
  <li data-number="245">The goodly mothers that have groan’d for these,</li>
  <li>And all the longing maids that ever lov’d,</li>
  <li>If your vow stand, shall curse me and my beauty,</li>
  <li>And in their funeral songs for these two cousins</li>
  <li>Despise my cruelty, and cry woe worth me,</li>
  <li data-number="250">Till I am nothing but the scorn of women.</li>
  <li>For heaven’s sake save their lives, and banish ’em.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="THE.">

<ol data-speaker="EMIL.">

<ol data-speaker="PAL.">
  <li data-offset="4">I’ll be cut a-pieces</li>

  <li>O all ye gods, despise me then. Thy banishment</li>
  <li>I not mislike, so we may fairly carry</li>
  <li data-number="260">Our swords and cause along; else, never trifle,</li>

  <li>I do not think she was very well, for, now</li>
  <li>You make me mind her, but this very day</li>
  <li>I ask’d her questions, and she answered me</li>

<ol data-speaker="JAIL.">

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WOOER.">
  <li>I’ll tell you quickly. As I late was angling</li>
  <li>In the great lake that lies behind the palace,</li>
  <li data-number="55">From the far shore, thick set with reeds and sedges,</li>
  <li>As patiently I was attending sport,</li>
  <li>I heard a voice, a shrill one; and attentive</li>
  <li>I gave my ear, when I might well perceive</li>
  <li>’Twas one that sung, and by the smallness of it,</li>
  <li data-number="60">A boy or woman. I then left my angle</li>
  <li>To his own skill, came near, but yet perceiv’d not</li>
  <li>Who made the sound, the rushes and the reeds</li>
  <li>Had so encompass’d it. I laid me down</li>
  <li>And list’ned to the words she sung, for then</li>
  <li>Through a small glade cut by the fishermen,</li>
  <li>I saw it was your daughter.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JAIL.">
  <li data-offset="5">Pray go on, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WOOER.">
  <li>She sung much, but no sense; only I heard her</li>
  <li>Repeat this often, “Palamon is gone,</li>
  <li>Is gone to th’ wood to gather mulberries.</li>
  <li>I’ll find him out tomorrow.”</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. FRIEND.">

  <li>“His shackles will betray him, he’ll be taken,</li>
  <li>And what shall I do then? I’ll bring a bevy,</li>
  <li>A hundred black-ey’d maids that love as I do,</li>
  <li>With chaplets on their heads of daffadillies,</li>
  <li data-number="75">With cherry lips and cheeks of damask roses,</li>
  <li>And all we’ll dance an antic ’fore the Duke,</li>
  <li>And beg his pardon.” Then she talk’d of you, sir:</li>
  <li>That you must lose your head tomorrow morning,</li>
  <li>And she must gather flowers to bury you,</li>
  <li data-number="80">And see the house made handsome. Then she sung</li>
  <li>Nothing but “Willow, willow, willow,” and between</li>
  <li>Ever was “Palamon, fair Palamon,”</li>
  <li>And “Palamon was a tall young man.” The place</li>
  <li>Was knee-deep where she sat; her careless tresses</li>
  <li data-number="85">A wreath of bulrush rounded; about her stuck</li>
  <li>Thousand fresh water-flowers of several colors,</li>
  <li>That methought she appear’d like the fair nymph</li>
  <li>That feeds the lake with waters, or as Iris</li>
  <li>Newly dropp’d down from heaven. Rings she made</li>
  <li data-number="90">Of rushes that grew by, and to ’em spoke</li>
  <li>The prettiest posies—“Thus our true love’s tied,”</li>
  <li>“This you may loose, not me,” and many a one;</li>
  <li>And then she wept, and sung again, and sigh’d,</li>
  <li>And with the same breath smil’d, and kiss’d her hand.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. FRIEND.">
  <li>Alas, what pity it is!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WOOER.">
  <li data-number="95" data-offset="4">I made in to her.</li>
  <li>She saw me, and straight sought the flood. I sav’d her,</li>
  <li>And set her safe to land; when presently</li>
  <li>She slipp’d away, and to the city made</li>
  <li>With such a cry and swiftness that, believe me,</li>
  <li data-number="100">She left me far behind her. Three or four</li>
  <li>I saw from far off cross her—one of ’em</li>
  <li>I knew to be your brother; where she stay’d,</li>
  <li>And fell, scarce to be got away. I left them with her,</li>

<ol data-speaker="EMIL.">
  <li>Yet I may bind those wounds up, that must open</li>
  <li>And bleed to death for my sake else. I’ll choose,</li>
  <li>And end their strife. Two such young handsome men</li>
  <li>Shall never fall for me; their weeping mothers,</li>
  <li data-number="5">Following the dead-cold ashes of their sons,</li>
  <li>Shall never curse my cruelty. Good heaven,</li>
  <li>What a sweet face has Arcite! If wise Nature,</li>
  <li>With all her best endowments, all those beauties</li>
  <li>She sows into the births of noble bodies,</li>
  <li data-number="10">Were here a mortal woman, and had in her</li>
  <li>The coy denials of young maids, yet doubtless</li>
  <li>She would run mad for this man. What an eye,</li>
  <li>Of what a fiery sparkle and quick sweetness,</li>
  <li>Has this young prince! Here Love himself sits smiling.</li>
  <li data-number="15">Just such another wanton Ganymede</li>
  <li>Set Jove afire with, and enforc’d the god</li>
  <li>Snatch up the goodly boy and set him by him,</li>
  <li>A shining constellation. What a brow,</li>
  <li>Of what a spacious majesty, he carries,</li>
  <li data-number="20">Arch’d like the great-ey’d Juno’s, but far sweeter,</li>
  <li>Smoother than Pelops’ shoulder! Fame and Honor</li>
  <li>Methinks from hence, as from a promontory</li>
  <li>Pointed in heaven, should clap their wings and sing</li>
  <li>To all the under world the loves and fights</li>
  <li data-number="25">Of gods and such men near ’em. Palamon</li>
  <li>Is but his foil, to him, a mere dull shadow;</li>
  <li>He’s swarth and meagre, of an eye as heavy</li>
  <li>As if he had lost his mother; a still temper,</li>
  <li>No stirring in him, no alacrity,</li>
  <li data-number="30">Of all this sprightly sharpness, not a smile.</li>
  <li>Yet these that we count errors may become him:</li>
  <li>Narcissus was a sad boy, but a heavenly.</li>
  <li>O, who can find the bent of woman’s fancy?</li>
  <li>I am a fool, my reason is lost in me;</li>
  <li data-number="35">I have no choice, and I have lied so lewdly</li>
  <li>That women ought to beat me. On my knees</li>
  <li>I ask thy pardon: Palamon, thou art alone</li>
  <li>And only beautiful, and these the eyes,</li>
  <li>These the bright lamps of beauty, that command</li>
  <li data-number="40">And threaten Love, and what young maid dare cross ’em?</li>
  <li>What a bold gravity, and yet inviting,</li>
  <li>Has this brown manly face! O Love, this only</li>
  <li>From this hour is complexion. Lie there, Arcite,</li>
  <li>Thou art a changeling to him, a mere gypsy,</li>
  <li data-number="45">And this the noble body. I am sotted,</li>
  <li>Utterly lost. My virgin’s faith has fled me;</li>
  <li>For if my brother but even now had ask’d me</li>
  <li>Whether I lov’d, I had run mad for Arcite;</li>
  <li>Now if my sister—more for Palamon.</li>
  <li data-number="50">Stand both together: now, come ask me, brother—</li>
  <li>Alas, I know not! Ask me now, sweet sister—</li>
  <li>I may go look! What a mere child is fancy,</li>
  <li>That having two fair gauds of equal sweetness,</li>
  <li>Cannot distinguish, but must cry for both!</li>

  <li>You that have seen them, what they are.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. MESS.">
  <li data-offset="8">I will, sir,</li>
  <li>And truly what I think. Six braver spirits</li>
  <li>Than these they have brought (if we judge by the outside)</li>
  <li data-number="75">I never saw nor read of. He that stands</li>
  <li>In the first place with Arcite, by his seeming</li>
  <li>Should be a stout man, by his face a prince</li>
  <li>(His very looks so say him), his complexion</li>
  <li>Nearer a brown than black; stern, and yet noble,</li>
  <li data-number="80">Which shows him hardy, fearless, proud of dangers.</li>
  <li>The circles of his eyes show fire within him,</li>
  <li>And as a heated lion, so he looks;</li>
  <li>His hair hangs long behind him, black and shining</li>
  <li>Like ravens’ wings; his shoulders broad and strong,</li>
  <li data-number="85">Arm’d long and round, and on his thigh a sword</li>
  <li>Hung by a curious baldrick, when he frowns</li>
  <li>To seal his will with. Better, o’ my conscience,</li>
  <li>Was never soldier’s friend.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="THE.">
  <li>Thou hast well describ’d him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PIR.">
  <li data-offset="6">Yet a great deal short,</li>

</ol>

  <li>Pray speak him, friend.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PIR.">
  <li data-offset="5">I guess he is a prince too,</li>
  <li>And if it may be, greater; for his show</li>
  <li>Has all the ornament of honor in’t.</li>
  <li>He’s somewhat bigger than the knight he spoke of,</li>
  <li data-number="95">But of a face far sweeter; his complexion</li>
  <li>Is, as a ripe grape, ruddy. He has felt</li>
  <li>Without doubt what he fights for, and so apter</li>
  <li>To make this cause his own. In ’s face appears</li>
  <li>All the fair hopes of what he undertakes,</li>
  <li data-number="100">And when he’s angry, then a settled valor</li>
  <li>(Not tainted with extremes) runs through his body,</li>
  <li>And guides his arm to brave things. Fear he cannot,</li>
  <li>He shows no such soft temper. His head’s yellow,</li>
  <li>Hard-hair’d, and curl’d, thick twin’d like ivy-tods,</li>
  <li data-number="105">Not to undo with thunder. In his face</li>
  <li>The livery of the warlike maid appears,</li>
  <li>Pure red and white, for yet no beard has blest him;</li>
  <li>And in his rolling eyes sits victory,</li>
  <li>As if she ever meant to crown his valor.</li>
  <li data-number="110">His nose stands high, a character of honor;</li>
  <li>His red lips, after fights, are fit for ladies.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EMIL.">
  <li>Must these men die too?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PIR.">
  <li data-offset="5">When he speaks, his tongue</li>

  <li>Are as a man would wish ’em, strong and clean.</li>
  <li>He wears a well-steel’d axe, the staff of gold.</li>
  <li>His age some five and twenty.</li>

  <li data-offset="6">There’s another,</li>

<ol data-speaker="1. MESS.">

  <li>Great and fine art in nature. He’s white-hair’d,</li>
  <li>Not wanton white, but such a manly color</li>
  <li data-number="125">Next to an auburn; tough and nimble set,</li>
  <li>Which shows an active soul; his arms are brawny,</li>
  <li>Lin’d with strong sinews; to the shoulder-piece</li>
  <li>Gently they swell, like women new conceiv’d,</li>
  <li>Which speaks him prone to labor, never fainting</li>
  <li data-number="130">Under the weight of arms; stout-hearted, still,</li>
  <li>But when he stirs, a tiger. He’s grey-ey’d,</li>
  <li>Which yields compassion where he conquers; sharp</li>
  <li>To spy advantages, and where he finds ’em,</li>
  <li>He’s swift to make ’em his. He does no wrongs,</li>
  <li data-number="135">Nor takes none. He’s round-fac’d, and when he smiles</li>
  <li>He shows a lover, when he frowns, a soldier.</li>
  <li>About his head he wears the winner’s oak,</li>
  <li>And in it stuck the favor of his lady.</li>
  <li>His age some six and thirty. In his hand</li>
  <li>He bears a charging-staff emboss’d with silver.</li>

  <li>That intemp’rate surfeit of her eye hath distemper’d the other senses. They may return and settle again to execute their preordain’d faculties, but they are now in a most extravagant vagary. This you must do: confine her to a place where the light may rather seem to steal in than be permitted. Take upon you, young sir her friend, the name of Palamon, say you come to eat with her, and to commune of love. This will catch her attention, for this her mind beats upon; other objects that are inserted ’tween her mind and eye become the pranks and friskins of her madness. Sing to her such green songs of love as she says Palamon hath sung in prison. Come to her, stuck in as sweet flowers as the season is mistress of, and thereto make an addition of some other compounded odors which are grateful to the sense. All this shall become Palamon, for Palamon can sing, and Palamon is sweet, and ev’ry good thing. Desire to eat with her, carve her, drink to her, and still among intermingle your petition of grace and acceptance into her favor. Learn what maids have been her companions and play-feres, and let them repair to her with Palamon in their mouths, and appear with tokens, as if they suggested for him. It is a falsehood she is in, which is with falsehoods to be combated. This may bring her to eat, to sleep, and reduce what’s now out of square in her into their former law and regiment. I have seen it approv’d, how many times I know not, but to make the number more I have great hope in this. I will, between the passages of this project, come in with my appliance.

  <li>Arcite is gently visag’d; yet his eye</li>

  <li data-number="115" data-offset="5">O loved sister,</li>
  <li>He speaks now of as brave a knight as e’er</li>
  <li>Did spur a noble steed. Surely the gods</li>
  <li>Would have him die a bachelor, lest his race</li>
  <li>Should show i’ th’ world too godlike. His behavior</li>
  <li data-number="120">So charm’d me that methought Alcides was</li>
  <li>To him a sow of lead. If I could praise</li>
  <li>Each part of him to th’ all I have spoke, your Arcite</li>
  <li>Did not lose by’t; for he that was thus good</li>
  <li>Encount’red yet his better. I have heard</li>
  <li data-number="125">Two emulous Philomels beat the ear o’ th’ night</li>
  <li>With their contentious throats, now one the higher,</li>
  <li>Anon the other, then again the first,</li>

  <li>Make hardly one the winner.—Wear the girlond</li>
  <li>With joy that you have won.—For the subdu’d,</li>
  <li>Give them our present justice, since I know</li>
  <li>Their lives but pinch ’em. Let it here be done.</li>
  <li data-number="135">The scene’s not for our seeing, go we hence,</li>
  <li>Right joyful, with some sorrow.—Arm your prize,</li>
  <li>I know you will not loose her.—Hippolyta,</li>
  <li>I see one eye of yours conceives a tear,</li>
  <li>The which it will deliver.</li>

  <li>And charge me live to comfort this unfriended,</li>
  <li>This miserable prince, that cuts away</li>

  <li>Let us look sadly, and give grace unto</li>
  <li>The funeral of Arcite, in whose end</li>
  <li>The visages of bridegrooms we’ll put on</li>
  <li>And smile with Palamon; for whom an hour,</li>
  <li data-number="130">But one hour since, I was as dearly sorry</li>
  <li>As glad of Arcite; and am now as glad</li>
  <li>As for him sorry. O you heavenly charmers,</li>
  <li>What things you make of us! For what we lack</li>
  <li>We laugh, for what we have are sorry, still</li>
  <li data-number="135">Are children in some kind. Let us be thankful</li>
  <li>For that which is, and with you leave dispute</li>
  <li>That are above our question. Let’s go off,</li>
  <li>And bear us like the time.</li>
