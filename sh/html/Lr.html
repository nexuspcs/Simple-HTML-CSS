<ol data-speaker="KENT.">
  <li>I thought the King had more affected the Duke of Albany than Cornwall.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>It did always seem so to us; but now in the division of the kingdom, it appears not which of the Dukes he values most, for equalities are so weigh’d, that curiosity in neither can make choice of either’s moi’ty.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KENT.">
  <li>Is not this your son, my lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge. I have so often blush’d to acknowledge him, that now I am braz’d to’t.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KENT.">
  <li data-number="5">I cannot conceive you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>Sir, this young fellow’s mother could; whereupon she grew round-womb’d, and had indeed, sir, a son for her cradle ere she had a husband for her bed. Do you smell a fault?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KENT.">
  <li>I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it being so proper.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>But I have a son, sir, by order of law, some year elder than this, who yet is no dearer in my account. Though this knave came something saucily to the world before he was sent for, yet was his mother fair, there was good sport at his making, and the whoreson must be acknowledg’d. Do you know this noble gentleman, Edmund?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EDM.">
  <li>No, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li data-number="10">My Lord of Kent. Remember him hereafter as my honorable friend.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EDM.">
  <li>My services to your lordship.</li>

  <li>I must love you, and sue to know you better.</li>

  <li>Mean time we shall express our darker purpose.</li>
  <li>Give me the map there. Know that we have divided</li>
  <li data-number="20">In three our kingdom; and ’tis our fast intent</li>
  <li>To shake all cares and business from our age,</li>
  <li>Conferring them on younger strengths, while we</li>
  <li>Unburden’d crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,</li>
  <li>And you, our no less loving son of Albany,</li>
  <li data-number="25">We have this hour a constant will to publish</li>
  <li>Our daughters’ several dowers, that future strife</li>
  <li>May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,</li>
  <li>Great rivals in our youngest daughter’s love,</li>
  <li>Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,</li>
  <li data-number="30">And here are to be answer’d. Tell me, my daughters</li>
  <li>(Since now we will divest us both of rule,</li>
  <li>Interest of territory, cares of state),</li>
  <li>Which of you shall we say doth love us most,</li>
  <li>That we our largest bounty may extend</li>
  <li data-number="35">Where nature doth with merit challenge? Goneril,</li>
  <li>Our eldest-born, speak first.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GON.">
  <li>Sir, I love you more than words can wield the matter,</li>
  <li>Dearer than eyesight, space, and liberty,</li>
  <li>Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare,</li>
  <li data-number="40">No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honor;</li>
  <li>As much as child e’er lov’d, or father found;</li>
  <li>A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable:</li>
  <li>Beyond all manner of so much I love you.</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="REG.">
  <li>I am made of that self metal as my sister,</li>
  <li>And prize me at her worth. In my true heart</li>
  <li>I find she names my very deed of love;</li>
  <li>Only she comes too short, that I profess</li>
  <li data-number="55">Myself an enemy to all other joys</li>
  <li>Which the most precious square of sense possesses,</li>

<ol data-speaker="LEAR.">
  <li>To thee and thine hereditary ever</li>
  <li>Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom,</li>
  <li>No less in space, validity, and pleasure,</li>
  <li>Than that conferr’d on Goneril.—Now, our joy,</li>
  <li data-number="65">Although our last and least, to whose young love</li>
  <li>The vines of France and milk of Burgundy</li>
  <li>Strive to be interess’d, what can you say to draw</li>

<ol data-speaker="LEAR.">
  <li>How, how, Cordelia? Mend your speech a little,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COR.">
  <li data-offset="7">Good my lord,</li>
  <li>You have begot me, bred me, lov’d me: I</li>
  <li>Return those duties back as are right fit,</li>
  <li data-number="80">Obey you, love you, and most honor you.</li>
  <li>Why have my sisters husbands, if they say</li>
  <li>They love you all? Happily, when I shall wed,</li>
  <li>That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry</li>
  <li>Half my love with him, half my care and duty.</li>
  <li data-number="85">Sure I shall never marry like my sisters,</li>

  <li data-offset="6">Ay, my good lord.</li>

  <li>So young, and so untender?</li>

  <li>So young, my lord, and true.</li>

<ol data-speaker="LEAR.">
  <li data-number="90">Let it be so: thy truth then be thy dow’r!</li>
  <li>For by the sacred radiance of the sun,</li>
  <li>The mysteries of Hecat and the night;</li>
  <li>By all the operation of the orbs,</li>
  <li>From whom we do exist and cease to be;</li>
  <li data-number="95">Here I disclaim all my paternal care,</li>

  <li>Or he that makes his generation messes</li>
  <li data-number="100">To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom</li>

  <li>Peace, Kent!</li>

  <li>I do invest you jointly with my power,</li>

  <li>Let it fall rather, though the fork invade</li>

  <li>When Lear is mad. What wouldest thou do, old man?</li>
  <li>Think’st thou that duty shall have dread to speak</li>
  <li data-number="130">When power to flattery bows? To plainness honor’s bound,</li>
  <li>When majesty falls to folly. Reserve thy state,</li>
  <li>And in thy best consideration check</li>
  <li>This hideous rashness. Answer my life my judgment,</li>
  <li>Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least,</li>
  <li>Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sounds</li>
  <li>Reverb no hollowness.</li>
</ol>

  <li data-offset="4">Kent, on thy life, no more.</li>

<ol data-speaker="LEAR.">
  <li>My Lord of Burgundy,</li>
  <li>We first address toward you, who with this king</li>
  <li>Hath rivall’d for our daughter. What, in the least,</li>
  <li>Will you require in present dower with her,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BUR.">
  <li data-number="175" data-offset="6">Most royal Majesty,</li>

<ol data-speaker="LEAR.">
  <li data-offset="5">Right noble Burgundy,</li>
  <li>When she was dear to us, we did hold her so,</li>

  <li data-number="210">No unchaste action, or dishonored step,</li>

  <li>That’s most certain, and with you; next month with us.</li>

<ol data-speaker="GON.">
  <li>You see how full of changes his age is; the observation we have made of it hath not been little. He always lov’d our sister most, and with what poor judgment he hath now cast her off appears too grossly.</li>

  <li>’Tis the infirmity of his age, yet he hath ever but slenderly known himself.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GON.">
  <li>The best and soundest of his time hath been but rash; then must we look from his age to receive not alone the imperfections of long-ingraff’d condition, but therewithal the unruly waywardness that infirm and choleric years bring with them.</li>

  <li>O villain, villain! His very opinion in the letter. Abhorred villain! Unnatural, detested, brutish villain! Worse than brutish! Go, sirrah, seek him; I’ll apprehend him. Abominable villain! Where is he?</li>

<ol data-speaker="EDM.">
  <li data-number="50">I do not well know, my lord.

  <li>These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us. Though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus, yet nature finds itself scourg’d by the sequent effects. Love cools, friendship falls off, brothers divide: in cities, mutinies; in countries, discord; in palaces, treason; and the bond crack’d ’twixt son and father. This villain of mine comes under the prediction; 
there’s son against father: the King falls from bias of nature; there’s father against child. We have seen the best of our time. Machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves. Find out this villain, Edmund, it shall lose thee nothing, do it carefully. 
And the noble and true-hearted Kent banish’d! His offense, honesty! ’Tis strange.</li>

  <li>This is the excellent foppery of the world, that when we are sick in fortune—often the surfeits of our own behavior—we make guilty of our disasters the sun, the moon, and stars, as if we were villains on necessity, fools by heavenly compulsion, knaves, thieves, and treachers by spherical predominance; drunkards, liars, and adulterers by an enforc’d obedience of planetary influence; and all that we are evil in, by a divine thrusting on. An admirable evasion of whoremaster man, to lay his goatish disposition on the charge of a star! My father compounded with my mother under the Dragon’s tail, and my nativity was under Ursa Major, so that it follows, I am rough and lecherous.

  <li>Ay, sir, she took them, read them in my presence,</li>
