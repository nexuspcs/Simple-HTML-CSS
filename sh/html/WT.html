  <li>If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia on the like occasion whereon my services are now on foot, you shall see (as I have said) great difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAM.">
  <li>I think, this coming summer, the King of Sicilia means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARCH.">
  <li>Wherein our entertainment shall shame us: we will be justified in our loves; for indeed—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAM.">
  <li>Beseech you—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARCH.">
  <li data-number="5">Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge: we cannot with such magnificence—in so rare—I know not what to say—We will give you sleepy drinks, that your senses (unintelligent of our insufficience) may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuse us.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAM.">
  <li>You pay a great deal too dear for what’s given freely.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARCH.">
  <li>Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs me, and as mine honesty puts it to utterance.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAM.">
  <li>Sicilia cannot show himself overkind to Bohemia. They were train’d together in their childhoods; and there rooted betwixt them then such an affection, which cannot choose but branch now. Since their more mature dignities and royal necessities made separation of their society, their encounters (though not personal) hath been royally attorney’d with interchange of gifts, letters, loving embassies, that they have seem’d to be together, though absent; shook hands, as over a vast; and embrac’d as it were from the ends of oppos’d winds. The heavens continue their loves!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARCH.">
  <li>I think there is not in the world either malice or matter to alter it. You have an unspeakable comfort of your young prince Mamillius: it is a gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came into my note.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAM.">
  <li data-number="10">I very well agree with you in the hopes of him; it is a gallant child; one that, indeed, physics the subject, makes old hearts fresh. They that went on crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to see him a man.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARCH.">
  <li>Would they else be content to die?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAM.">
  <li>Yes; if there were no other excuse why they should desire to live.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARCH.">
  <li>If the King had no son, they would desire to live on crutches till he had one.</li>

  <li>Nine changes of the wat’ry star hath been</li>
  <li>The shepherd’s note since we have left our throne</li>
  <li>Without a burden. Time as long again</li>
  <li>Would be fill’d up, my brother, with our thanks,</li>
  <li data-number="5">And yet we should, for perpetuity,</li>
  <li>Go hence in debt. And therefore, like a cipher</li>
  <li>(Yet standing in rich place), I multiply</li>
  <li>With one “We thank you” many thousands more</li>
  <li>That go before it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li data-offset="4">Stay your thanks a while,</li>
  <li>And pay them when you part.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POL.">
  <li data-number="10" data-offset="6">Sir, that’s tomorrow.</li>
  <li>I am question’d by my fears of what may chance</li>
  <li>Or breed upon our absence, that may blow</li>
  <li>No sneaping winds at home, to make us say,</li>
  <li>“This is put forth too truly.” Besides, I have stay’d</li>
  <li>To tire your royalty.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li data-offset="4">We are tougher, brother,</li>
  <li>Than you can put us to’t.</li>

<ol data-speaker="POL.">
  <li data-offset="5">No longer stay.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li>One sev’nnight longer.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POL.">
  <li data-offset="5">Very sooth, tomorrow.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li>We’ll part the time between ’s then; and in that</li>
  <li>I’ll no gainsaying.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POL.">
  <li data-offset="4">Press me not, beseech you, so.</li>
  <li data-number="20">There is no tongue that moves, none, none i’ th’ world,</li>
  <li>So soon as yours could win me. So it should now,</li>
  <li>Were there necessity in your request, although</li>
  <li>’Twere needful I denied it. My affairs</li>
  <li>Do even drag me homeward; which to hinder</li>
  <li data-number="25">Were (in your love) a whip to me; my stay,</li>
  <li>To you a charge and trouble. To save both,</li>
  <li>Farewell, our brother.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li data-offset="4">Tongue-tied our queen? Speak you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HER.">
  <li>I had thought, sir, to have held my peace until</li>
  <li>You had drawn oaths from him not to stay. You, sir,</li>
  <li data-number="30">Charge him too coldly. Tell him you are sure</li>
  <li>All in Bohemia’s well; this satisfaction</li>
  <li>The by-gone day proclaim’d. Say this to him,</li>
  <li>He’s beat from his best ward.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li data-offset="6">Well said, Hermione.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HER.">
  <li>To tell he longs to see his son were strong;</li>
  <li data-number="35">But let him say so then, and let him go;</li>
  <li>But let him swear so, and he shall not stay,</li>
  <li>We’ll thwack him hence with distaffs.</li>
  <li>Yet of your royal presence I’ll adventure</li>
  <li>The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia</li>
  <li data-number="40">You take my lord, I’ll give him my commission</li>
  <li>To let him there a month behind the gest</li>
  <li>Prefix’d for ’s parting; yet, good deed, Leontes,</li>
  <li>I love thee not a jar o’ th’ clock behind</li>
  <li>What lady she her lord. You’ll stay?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POL.">
  <li data-offset="7">No, madam.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HER.">
  <li>Nay, but you will?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POL.">
  <li data-number="45" data-offset="4">I may not, verily.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HER.">
  <li>Verily?</li>
  <li>You put me off with limber vows; but I,</li>
  <li>Though you would seek t’ unsphere the stars with oaths,</li>
  <li>Should yet say, “Sir, no going.” Verily,</li>
  <li data-number="50">You shall not go; a lady’s “verily” is</li>
  <li>As potent as a lord’s. Will you go yet?</li>
  <li>Force me to keep you as a prisoner,</li>
  <li>Not like a guest: so you shall pay your fees</li>
  <li>When you depart, and save your thanks. How say you?</li>
  <li>My prisoner? Or my guest? By your dread “verily,”</li>
  <li>One of them you shall be.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POL.">
  <li data-offset="5">Your guest then, madam.</li>
  <li>To be your prisoner should import offending,</li>
  <li>Which is for me less easy to commit</li>
  <li>Than you to punish.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HER.">
  <li data-offset="4">Not your jailer then,</li>
  <li data-number="60">But your kind hostess. Come, I’ll question you</li>
  <li>Of my lord’s tricks and yours when you were boys.</li>
  <li>You were pretty lordings then?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POL.">
  <li data-offset="7">We were, fair queen,</li>
  <li>Two lads that thought there was no more behind</li>
  <li>But such a day tomorrow as today,</li>
  <li>And to be boy eternal.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HER.">
  <li data-number="65" data-offset="5">Was not my lord</li>
  <li>The verier wag o’ th’ two?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POL.">
  <li>We were as twinn’d lambs that did frisk i’ th’ sun,</li>
  <li>And bleat the one at th’ other. What we chang’d</li>
  <li>Was innocence for innocence; we knew not</li>
  <li data-number="70">The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream’d</li>
  <li>That any did. Had we pursu’d that life,</li>
  <li>And our weak spirits ne’er been higher rear’d</li>
  <li>With stronger blood, we should have answer’d heaven</li>
  <li>Boldly, “Not guilty”; the imposition clear’d,</li>
  <li>Hereditary ours.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HER.">
  <li data-offset="4">By this we gather</li>
  <li>You have tripp’d since.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POL.">
  <li data-offset="5">O my most sacred lady,</li>
  <li>Temptations have since then been born to ’s: for</li>
  <li>In those unfledg’d days was my wife a girl;</li>
  <li>Your precious self had then not cross’d the eyes</li>
  <li>Of my young playfellow.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HER.">
  <li data-number="80" data-offset="5">Grace to boot!</li>
  <li>Of this make no conclusion, lest you say</li>
  <li>Your queen and I are devils. Yet go on,</li>
  <li>Th’ offenses we have made you do we’ll answer,</li>
  <li>If you first sinn’d with us, and that with us</li>
  <li>You did continue fault, and that you slipp’d not</li>
  <li>With any but with us.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li data-offset="4">Is he won yet?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HER.">
  <li>He’ll stay, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li data-offset="4">At my request he would not.</li>
  <li>Hermione, my dearest, thou never spok’st</li>
  <li>To better purpose.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HER.">
  <li data-offset="4">Never?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li data-offset="5">Never, but once.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HER.">
  <li data-number="90">What? Have I twice said well? When was’t before?</li>
  <li>I prithee tell me; cram ’s with praise, and make ’s</li>
  <li>As fat as tame things. One good deed dying tongueless</li>
  <li>Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.</li>
  <li>Our praises are our wages. You may ride ’s</li>
  <li data-number="95">With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere</li>
  <li>With spur we heat an acre. But to th’ goal:</li>
  <li>My last good deed was to entreat his stay;</li>
  <li>What was my first? It has an elder sister,</li>
  <li>Or I mistake you. O, would her name were Grace!</li>
  <li>But once before I spoke to th’ purpose? When?</li>
  <li>Nay, let me have’t; I long.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li data-offset="5">Why, that was when</li>
  <li>Three crabbed months had sour’d themselves to death,</li>
  <li>Ere I could make thee open thy white hand,</li>
  <li>And clap thyself my love; then didst thou utter,</li>
  <li>“I am yours forever.”</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HER.">
  <li data-number="105" data-offset="5">’Tis Grace indeed.</li>
  <li>Why, lo you now! I have spoke to th’ purpose twice:</li>
  <li>The one forever earn’d a royal husband;</li>
  <li>Th’ other for some while a friend.</li>

  <li>To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods.</li>
  <li data-number="110">I have <foreign xml:lang="la">tremor cordis</foreign> on me; my heart dances,</li>

  <li>From heartiness, from bounty, fertile bosom,</li>
  <li>And well become the agent; ’t may—I grant.</li>
  <li data-number="115">But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers,</li>

  <li>As in a looking-glass; and then to sigh, as ’twere</li>

  <li>That will say any thing. But were they false</li>
  <li>As o’er-dy’d blacks, as wind, as waters, false</li>
  <li>As dice are to be wish’d by one that fixes</li>

  <li>Thou dost make possible things not so held,</li>
  <li data-number="140">Communicat’st with dreams (how can this be?),</li>
  <li>With what’s unreal thou co-active art,</li>

  <li data-number="150" data-offset="5">No, in good earnest.</li>
  <li>How sometimes nature will betray its folly!</li>
  <li>Its tenderness! And make itself a pastime</li>
  <li>To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines</li>
  <li>Of my boy’s face, methoughts I did recoil</li>
  <li data-number="155">Twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech’d</li>
  <li>In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled,</li>
  <li>Lest it should bite its master, and so prove</li>
  <li>(As ornament oft does) too dangerous.</li>

  <li data-offset="5">My gracious lord,</li>

  <li>In every one of these no man is free</li>
  <li>But that his negligence, his folly, fear,</li>
  <li>Among the infinite doings of the world,</li>
  <li>Sometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord,</li>
  <li data-number="255">If ever I were willful-negligent,</li>
  <li>It was my folly; if industriously</li>
  <li>I play’d the fool, it was my negligence,</li>
  <li>Not weighing well the end; if ever fearful</li>
  <li>To do a thing, where I the issue doubted,</li>
  <li data-number="260">Whereof the execution did cry out</li>
  <li>Against the non-performance, ’twas a fear</li>
  <li>Which oft infects the wisest: these, my lord,</li>
  <li>Are such allow’d infirmities that honesty</li>
  <li>Is never free of. But beseech your Grace</li>
  <li data-number="265">Be plainer with me, let me know my trespass</li>
  <li>By its own visage. If I then deny it,</li>

  <li>My wife is slippery? If thou wilt confess,</li>
  <li>Or else be impudently negative,</li>
  <li data-number="275">To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought, then say</li>
  <li>My wife’s a hobby-horse, deserves a name</li>

<ol data-speaker="CAM.">
  <li>I would not be a stander-by to hear</li>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li data-offset="6">Is whispering nothing?</li>

  <li>Skulking in corners? Wishing clocks more swift?</li>
  <li data-number="290">Hours, minutes? Noon, midnight? And all eyes</li>

  <li data-offset="6">None rare, my lord.</li>

  <li>The King hath on him such a countenance</li>
  <li>As he had lost some province and a region</li>
  <li data-number="370">Lov’d as he loves himself. Even now I met him</li>
  <li>With customary compliment, when he,</li>

  <li>A lip of much contempt, speeds from me, and</li>
  <li>So leaves me to consider what is breeding</li>

  <li>I dare not know, my lord.</li>

  <li>How, dare not? Do not? Do you know, and dare not?</li>
  <li>Be intelligent to me, ’tis thereabouts:</li>
  <li>For to yourself, what you do know, you must,</li>
  <li data-number="380">And cannot say you dare not. Good Camillo,</li>
  <li>Your chang’d complexions are to me a mirror</li>
  <li>Which shows me mine chang’d too; for I must be</li>
  <li>A party in this alteration, finding</li>
  <li>Myself thus alter’d with’t.</li>

<ol data-speaker="CAM.">
  <li data-offset="5">There is a sickness</li>

  <li>As you are certainly a gentleman, thereto</li>

  <li>In whose success we are gentle, I beseech you,</li>

  <li data-number="400">I conjure thee, by all the parts of man</li>
  <li>Which honor does acknowledge, whereof the least</li>

  <li>Forbiddenly.</li>

<ol data-speaker="POL.">
  <li data-offset="3">O then, my best blood turn</li>
  <li>To an infected jelly, and my name</li>
  <li>Be yok’d with his that did betray the Best!</li>
  <li data-number="420">Turn then my freshest reputation to</li>
  <li>A savor that may strike the dullest nostril</li>
  <li>Where I arrive, and my approach be shunn’d,</li>
  <li>Nay, hated too, worse than the great’st infection</li>
  <li>That e’er was heard or read!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAM.">
  <li data-offset="6">Swear his thought over</li>
  <li data-number="425">By each particular star in heaven, and</li>
  <li>By all their influences, you may as well</li>

  <li>As or by oath remove or counsel shake</li>
  <li>The fabric of his folly, whose foundation</li>
  <li>Is pil’d upon his faith, and will continue</li>
  <li>The standing of his body.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POL.">
  <li data-offset="5">How should this grow?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAM.">
  <li>I know not; but I am sure ’tis safer to</li>
  <li>Avoid what’s grown than question how ’tis born.</li>
  <li>If therefore you dare trust my honesty,</li>
  <li data-number="435">That lies enclosed in this trunk which you</li>
  <li>Shall bear along impawn’d, away tonight!</li>
  <li>Your followers I will whisper to the business,</li>
  <li>And will by twos and threes at several posterns</li>
  <li>Clear them o’ th’ city. For myself, I’ll put</li>
  <li data-number="440">My fortunes to your service, which are here</li>
  <li>By this discovery lost. Be not uncertain,</li>
  <li>For by the honor of my parents, I</li>
  <li>Have utt’red truth; which if you seek to prove,</li>
  <li>I dare not stand by; nor shall you be safer</li>
  <li>Than one condemn’d by the King’s own mouth—thereon</li>
  <li>His execution sworn.</li>

  <li data-number="450">My people did expect my hence departure</li>
  <li>Two days ago. This jealousy</li>
  <li>Is for a precious creature: as she’s rare,</li>
  <li>Must it be great; and as his person’s mighty,</li>
  <li>Must it be violent; and as he does conceive</li>
  <li data-number="455">He is dishonor’d by a man which ever</li>
  <li>Profess’d to him, why, his revenges must</li>
  <li>In that be made more bitter. Fear o’ershades me.</li>
  <li>Good expedition be my friend, and comfort</li>
  <li>The gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothing</li>
  <li data-number="460">Of his ill-ta’en suspicion! Come, Camillo,</li>

<ol data-speaker="POL.">
  <li>I pray thee, good Camillo, be no more importunate. ’Tis a sickness denying thee any thing; a death to grant this.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAM.">
  <li>It is fifteen years since I saw my country; though I have for the most part been air’d abroad, I desire to lay my bones there. Besides, the penitent King, my master, hath sent for me, to whose feeling sorrows I might be some allay (or I o’erween to think so), which is another spur to my departure.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POL.">
  <li>As thou lov’st me, Camillo, wipe not out the rest of thy services by leaving me now. The need I have of thee, thine own goodness hath made. Better not to have had thee than thus to want thee. Thou, having made me businesses which none without thee can sufficiently manage, must either stay to execute them thyself, or take away with thee the very services thou hast done; which if I have not enough consider’d (as too much I cannot), to be more thankful to thee shall be my study, and my profit therein the heaping friendships. Of that fatal country Sicilia, prithee speak no more, whose very naming punishes me with the remembrance of that penitent (as thou call’st him) and reconcil’d king, my brother, whose loss of his most precious queen and children are even now to be afresh lamented. Say to me, when saw’st thou the Prince Florizel, my son? Kings are no less unhappy, their issue not being gracious, than they are in losing them when they have approv’d their virtues.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAM.">
  <li>Sir, it is three days since I saw the Prince. What his happier affairs may be, are to me unknown; but I have (missingly) noted, he is of late much retir’d from court, and is less frequent to his princely exercises than formerly he hath appear’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POL.">
  <li data-number="5">I have consider’d so much, Camillo, and with some care, so far that I have eyes under my service which look upon his removedness; from whom I have this intelligence, that he is seldom from the house of a most homely shepherd, a man, they say, that from very nothing, and beyond the imagination of his neighbors, is grown into an unspeakable estate.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAM.">
  <li>I have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a daughter of most rare note. The report of her is extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POL.">
  <li>That’s likewise part of my intelligence; but (I fear) the angle that plucks our son thither. Thou shalt accompany us to the place, where we will (not appearing what we are) have some question with the shepherd; from whose simplicity I think it not uneasy to get the cause of my son’s resort thither. Prithee be my present partner in this business, and lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia.</li>
</ol>

She hath made me four and twenty nosegays for the shearers (three-man song-men all, and very good ones), but they are most of them means and bases; but one Puritan amongst them, and he sings psalms to horn-pipes. I must have saffron to color the warden pies; mace; dates, none—that’s out of my note; nut-megs, seven; a race or two of ginger, but that I may beg; four pounds of prunes, and as many of raisins o’ th’ sun.</li>

They throng who should buy first, as if my trinkets had been hallow’d and brought a benediction to the buyer; by which means I saw whose purse was best in picture, and what I saw, to my good use I rememb’red. My clown (who wants but something to be a reasonable man) grew so in love with the wenches’ song, that he would not stir his pettitoes till he had both tune and words, which so drew the rest of the herd to me that all their other senses stuck in ears. You might have pinch’d a placket, it was senseless; ’twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a purse; I would have fil’d keys off that hung in chains. No hearing, no feeling, but my sir’s song, and admiring the nothing of it.

Sure the gods do this year connive at us, and we may do any thing extempore. The Prince himself is about a piece of iniquity: stealing away from his father with his clog at his heels.

  <li>Not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy and vengeance bitter; but those that are germane to him (though remov’d fifty times) shall all come under the hangman; which though it be great pity, yet it is necessary. An old sheep-whistling rogue, a ram-tender, to offer to have his daughter come into grace! Some say he shall be ston’d; but that death is too soft for him, say I.

But what talk we of these traitorly rascals, whose miseries are to be smil’d at, their offenses being so capital? Tell me (for you seem to be honest plain men) what you have to the King. Being something gently consider’d, I’ll bring you where he is aboard, tender your persons to his presence, whisper him in your behalfs; and if it be in man besides the King to effect your suits, here is man shall do it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLO.">
  <li>He seems to be of great authority. Close with him, give him gold; and though authority be a stubborn bear, yet he is oft led by the nose with gold. Show the inside of your purse to the outside of his hand, and no more ado. Remember “ston’d,” and “flay’d alive.”</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHEP.">
  <li>And’t please you, sir, to undertake the business for us, here is that gold I have. I’ll make it as much more, and leave this young man in pawn till I bring it you.</li>

<h3>Scene 2</h3>

<h4>Sicilia. Before Leontes’ palace.</h4>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Autolycus and a Gentleman.
	
		AUT.
		1. GENT.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="AUT.">
  <li>Beseech you, sir, were you present at this relation?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. GENT.">
  <li>I was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the old shepherd deliver the manner how he found it; whereupon, after a little amazedness, we were all commanded out of the chamber; only this, methought, I heard the shepherd say, he found the child.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AUT.">
  <li>I would most gladly know the issue of it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. GENT.">
  <li>I make a broken delivery of the business; but the changes I perceiv’d in the King and Camillo were very notes of admiration. They seem’d almost, with staring on one another, to tear the cases of their eyes. There was speech in their dumbness, language in their very gesture; they look’d as they had heard of a world ransom’d, or one destroy’d. A notable passion of wonder appear’d in them; but the wisest beholder, that knew no more but seeing, could not say if th’ importance were joy or sorrow; but in the extremity of the one, it must needs be.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">
	Enter another Gentleman.
	
		2. GENT.
	
</li>
  <li data-number="5">Here comes a gentleman that haply knows more. The news, Rogero?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. GENT.">
  <li>Nothing but bonfires. The oracle is fulfill’d; the King’s daughter is found. Such a deal of wonder is broken out within this hour that ballad-makers cannot be able to express it.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">
	Enter another Gentleman.
	
		3. GENT.
	
</li>
  <li>Here comes the Lady Paulina’s steward, he can deliver you more. How goes it now, sir? This news, which is call’d true, is so like an old tale, that the verity of it is in strong suspicion. Has the King found his heir?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="3. GENT.">
  <li>Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by circumstance. That which you hear you’ll swear you see, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle of Queen Hermione’s; her jewel about the neck of it; the letters of Antigonus found with it, which they know to be his character; the majesty of the creature in resemblance of the mother; the affection of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding; and many other evidences proclaim her, with all certainty, to be the King’s daughter. Did you see the meeting of the two kings?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. GENT.">
  <li>No.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="3. GENT.">
  <li data-number="10">Then have you lost a sight which was to be seen, cannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld one joy crown another, so and in such manner that it seem’d sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their joy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes, holding up of hands, with countenance of such distraction that they were to be known by garment, not by favor. Our king, being ready to leap out of himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that joy were now become a loss, cries, “O, thy mother, thy mother!”; then asks Bohemia forgiveness; then embraces his son-in-law; then again worries he his daughter with clipping her. Now he thanks the old shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten conduit of many kings’ reigns. I never heard of such another encounter, which lames report to follow it, and undoes description to do it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. GENT.">
  <li>What, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carried hence the child?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="3. GENT.">
  <li>Like an old tale still, which will have matter to rehearse, though credit be asleep and not an ear open: he was torn to pieces with a bear. This avouches the shepherd’s son, who has not only his innocence (which seems much) to justify him, but a handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. GENT.">
  <li>What became of his bark and his followers?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="3. GENT.">
  <li>Wrack’d the same instant of their master’s death, and in the view of the shepherd; so that all the instruments which aided to expose the child were even then lost when it was found. But O, the noble combat that ’twixt joy and sorrow was fought in Paulina! She had one eye declin’d for the loss of her husband, another elevated that the oracle was fulfill’d. She lifted the Princess from the earth, and so locks her in embracing, as if she would pin her to her heart, that she might no more be in danger of losing.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. GENT.">
  <li data-number="15">The dignity of this act was worth the audience of kings and princes, for by such was it acted.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="3. GENT.">
  <li>One of the prettiest touches of all, and that which angled for mine eyes (caught the water though not the fish), was when, at the relation of the Queen’s death (with the manner how she came to’t bravely confess’d and lamented by the King), how attentiveness wounded his daughter, till (from one sign of dolor to another) she did (with an “Alas!”), I would fain say, bleed tears; for I am sure my heart wept blood. Who was most marble there chang’d color; some swounded, all sorrow’d. If all the world could have seen’t, the woe had been universal.</li>
</ol>

  <li>Are they return’d to the court?</li>

<ol data-speaker="3. GENT.">
  <li>No. The Princess hearing of her mother’s statue, which is in the keeping of Paulina—a piece many years in doing and now newly perform’d by that rare Italian master, Julio Romano, who, had he himself eternity and could put breath into his work, would beguile Nature of her custom, so perfectly he is her ape. He so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of answer. Thither with all greediness of affection are they gone, and there they intend to sup.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. GENT.">
  <li>I thought she had some great matter there in hand, for she hath privately twice or thrice a day, ever since the death of Hermione, visited that remov’d house. Shall we thither, and with our company piece the rejoicing?</li>

  <li>Now, had I not the dash of my former life in me, would preferment drop on my head. I brought the old man and his son aboard the Prince; told him I heard them talk of a fardel, and I know not what; but he at that time, overfond of the shepherd’s daughter (so he then took her to be), who began to be much sea-sick, and himself little better, extremity of weather continuing, this mystery remain’d undiscover’d. But ’tis all one to me; for had I been the finder-out of this secret, it would not have relish’d among my other discredits.</li>

  <li>Here come those I have done good to against my will, and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune.</li>

<ol data-speaker="SHEP.">
  <li>Come, boy, I am past more children, but thy sons and daughters will be all gentlemen born.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLO.">
  <li>You are well met, sir. You denied to fight with me this other day, because I was no gentleman born. See you these clothes? Say you see them not and think me still no gentleman born. You were best say these robes are not gentlemen born. Give me the lie, do; and try whether I am not now a gentleman born.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AUT.">
  <li data-number="25">I know you are now, sir, a gentleman born.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLO.">
  <li>Ay, and have been so any time these four hours.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHEP.">
  <li>And so have I, boy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLO.">
  <li>So you have. But I was a gentleman born before my father; for the King’s son took me by the hand, and call’d me brother; and then the two kings call’d my father brother; and then the Prince, my brother, and the Princess, my sister, call’d my father father; and so we wept; and there was the first gentleman-like tears that ever we shed.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHEP.">
  <li>We may live, son, to shed many more.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLO.">
  <li data-number="30">Ay; or else ’twere hard luck, being in so preposterous estate as we are.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AUT.">
  <li>I humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all the faults I have committed to your worship, and to give me your good report to the Prince my master.</li>

<ol data-speaker="SHEP.">
  <li>Prithee, son, do; for we must be gentle, now we are gentlemen.</li>

  <li>Ay, and it like your good worship.</li>

<ol data-speaker="SHEP.">
  <li>You may say it, but not swear it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLO.">
  <li>Not swear it, now I am a gentleman? Let boors and franklins say it, I’ll swear it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHEP.">
  <li>How if it be false, son?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLO.">
  <li>If it be ne’er so false, a true gentleman may swear it in the behalf of his friend; and I’ll swear to the Prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands, and that thou wilt not be drunk; but I know thou art no tall fellow of thy hands, and that thou wilt be drunk; but I’ll swear it, and I would thou wouldst be a tall fellow of thy hands.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AUT.">
  <li data-number="40">I will prove so, sir, to my power.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLO.">
  <li>Ay, by any means prove a tall fellow. If I do not wonder how thou dar’st venture to be drunk, not being a tall fellow, trust me not. Hark, the kings and the princes, our kindred, are going to see the Queen’s picture. Come, follow us; we’ll be thy good masters.</li>

  <li>O grave and good Paulina, the great comfort</li>

  <li data-offset="5">What, sovereign sir,</li>
  <li>I did not well, I meant well. All my services</li>
  <li>You have paid home; but that you have vouchsaf’d,</li>

  <li>Heirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit,</li>
  <li>It is a surplus of your grace, which never</li>

  <li data-offset="5">O Paulina,</li>
  <li>We honor you with trouble; but we came</li>

  <li>Have we pass’d through, not without much content</li>
  <li>In many singularities; but we saw not</li>

  <li>The statue of her mother.</li>

  <li data-number="15">So her dead likeness, I do well believe,</li>

  <li>I like your silence, it the more shows off</li>

  <li>Chide me, dear stone, that I may say indeed</li>
  <li data-number="25">Thou art Hermione; or rather, thou art she</li>
  <li>In thy not chiding; for she was as tender</li>
  <li>As infancy and grace. But yet, Paulina,</li>
  <li>Hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing</li>
  <li>So aged as this seems.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POL.">
  <li data-offset="4">O, not by much.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAUL.">
  <li data-number="30">So much the more our carver’s excellence,</li>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li data-offset="4">As now she might have done,</li>
  <li>So much to my good comfort as it is</li>
  <li>Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,</li>
  <li data-number="35">Even with such life of majesty (warm life,</li>
  <li>As now it coldly stands), when first I woo’d her!</li>
  <li>I am asham’d; does not the stone rebuke me</li>
  <li>For being more stone than it? O royal piece,</li>
  <li>There’s magic in thy majesty, which has</li>
  <li data-number="40">My evils conjur’d to remembrance, and</li>
  <li>From thy admiring daughter took the spirits,</li>
  <li>Standing like stone with thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PER.">
  <li data-offset="6">And give me leave,</li>
  <li>And do not say ’tis superstition, that</li>
  <li>I kneel, and then implore her blessing. Lady,</li>
  <li>Dear queen, that ended when I but began,</li>

  <li data-offset="7">O, patience!</li>
  <li>The statue is but newly fix’d; the color’s</li>

  <li>My lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,</li>

  <li data-offset="5">Indeed, my lord,</li>

<ol data-speaker="PAUL.">
  <li>I am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirr’d you; but</li>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li data-number="75" data-offset="5">Do, Paulina;</li>
  <li>For this affliction has a taste as sweet</li>
  <li>As any cordial comfort. Still methinks</li>
  <li>There is an air comes from her. What fine chisel</li>
  <li>Could ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me,</li>

<ol data-speaker="PAUL.">
  <li data-number="80" data-offset="4">Good my lord, forbear.</li>
  <li>The ruddiness upon her lip is wet;</li>
  <li>You’ll mar it if you kiss it; stain your own</li>
  <li>With oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li>No! Not these twenty years.</li>
</ol>

  <li>By wicked powers.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li data-offset="4">What you can make her do,</li>
