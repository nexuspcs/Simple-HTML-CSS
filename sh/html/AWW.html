<h4>Roussillon. A room in the Count’s palace.</h4>

				Enter young Bertram, Count of Roussillon, his mother the Countess of Roussillon, and Helena, Lord Lafew, all in black.

<ol data-speaker="COUNT.">
  <li>In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BER.">
  <li>And I in going, madam, weep o’er my father’s death anew; but I must attend his Majesty’s command, to whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LAF.">
  <li>You shall find of the King a husband, madam; you, sir, a father. He that so generally is at all times good must of necessity hold his virtue to you, whose worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather than lack it where there is such abundance.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COUNT.">
  <li>What hope is there of his Majesty’s amendment?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LAF.">
  <li data-number="5">He hath abandon’d his physicians, madam, under whose practices he hath persecuted time with hope, and finds no other advantage in the process but only the losing of hope by time.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COUNT.">
  <li>This young gentlewoman had a father—O, that “had,” how sad a passage ’tis!—whose skill was almost as great as his honesty; had it stretch’d so far, would have made nature immortal, and death should have play for lack of work. Would for the King’s sake he were living! I think it would be the death of the King’s disease.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LAF.">
  <li>How call’d you the man you speak of, madam?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COUNT.">
  <li>He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was his great right to be so—Gerard de Narbon.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LAF.">
  <li>He was excellent indeed, madam. The King very lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly. He was skillful enough to have liv’d still, if knowledge could be set up against mortality.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BER.">
  <li data-number="10">What is it, my good lord, the King languishes of?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LAF.">
  <li>A fistula, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BER.">
  <li>I heard not of it before.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LAF.">
  <li>I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman the daughter of Gerard de Narbon?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COUNT.">
  <li>His sole child, my lord, and bequeath’d to my overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that her education promises her dispositions she inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there commendations go with pity: they are virtues and traitors too. In her they are the better for their simpleness; she derives her honesty, and achieves her goodness.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LAF.">
  <li data-number="15">Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COUNT.">
  <li>’Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise in. The remembrance of her father never approaches her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all livelihood from her cheek. No more of this, Helena; go to, no more, lest it be rather thought you affect a sorrow than to have—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HEL.">
  <li>I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LAF.">
  <li>Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead, excessive grief the enemy to the living.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COUNT.">
  <li>If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess makes it soon mortal.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BER.">
  <li data-number="20">Madam, I desire your holy wishes.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LAF.">
  <li>How understand we that?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COUNT.">
  <li>Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father</li>
  <li>In manners as in shape! Thy blood and virtue</li>
  <li>Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness</li>
  <li data-number="25">Share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,</li>
  <li>Do wrong to none. Be able for thine enemy</li>
  <li>Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend</li>
  <li>Under thy own life’s key. Be check’d for silence,</li>
  <li>But never tax’d for speech. What heaven more will,</li>
  <li data-number="30">That thee may furnish, and my prayers pluck down,</li>
  <li>Fall on thy head!—Farewell, my lord.</li>
  <li>’Tis an unseason’d courtier, good my lord,</li>
  <li>Advise him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LAF.">
  <li data-offset="3">He cannot want the best</li>
  <li>That shall attend his love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COUNT.">
  <li data-offset="5">Heaven bless him!</li>
  <li>Farewell, Bertram.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BER.">

  <li>Be forged in your thoughts be servants to you!</li>

  <li data-number="40">O, were that all! I think not on my father,</li>
  <li>And these great tears grace his remembrance more</li>
  <li>Than those I shed for him. What was he like?</li>
  <li>I have forgot him. My imagination</li>
  <li>Carries no favor in’t but Bertram’s.</li>
  <li data-number="45">I am undone, there is no living, none,</li>
  <li>If Bertram be away. ’Twere all one</li>
  <li>That I should love a bright particular star</li>
  <li>And think to wed it, he is so above me.</li>
  <li>In this bright radiance and collateral light</li>
  <li data-number="50">Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.</li>
  <li>Th’ ambition in my love thus plagues itself:</li>
  <li>The hind that would be mated by the lion</li>
  <li>Must die for love. ’Twas pretty, though a plague,</li>
  <li>To see him every hour, to sit and draw</li>
  <li data-number="55">His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,</li>
  <li>In our heart’s table—heart too capable</li>
  <li>Of every line and trick of his sweet favor.</li>
  <li>But now he’s gone, and my idolatrous fancy</li>
  <li>Must sanctify his reliques. Who comes here?</li>

  <li>And yet I know him a notorious liar,</li>
  <li>Think him a great way fool, solely a coward;</li>
  <li>Yet these fix’d evils sit so fit in him,</li>
  <li>That they take place when virtue’s steely bones</li>
  <li data-number="65">Looks bleak i’ th’ cold wind. Withal, full oft we see</li>
  <li>Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAR.">
  <li>’Save you, fair queen!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HEL.">
  <li>And you, monarch!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAR.">
  <li>No.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HEL.">
  <li data-number="70">And no.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAR.">
  <li>Are you meditating on virginity?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HEL.">
  <li>Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you; let me ask a question. Man is enemy to virginity; how may we barricade it against him?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAR.">
  <li>Keep him out.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HEL.">
  <li>But he assails, and our virginity though valiant, in the defense yet is weak. Unfold to us some warlike resistance.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAR.">
  <li data-number="75">There is none. Man, setting down before you, will undermine you and blow you up.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HEL.">
  <li>Bless our poor virginity from underminers and blowers-up! Is there no military policy how virgins might blow up men?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAR.">
  <li>Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be blown up. Marry, in blowing him down again, with the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational increase, and there was never virgin got till virginity was first lost. That you were made of is metal to make virgins. Virginity, by being once lost, may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is ever lost. ’Tis too cold a companion; away with’t!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HEL.">
  <li>I will stand for’t a little, though therefore I die a virgin.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAR.">
  <li>There’s little can be said in’t, ’tis against the rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity is to accuse your mothers, which is most infallible disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin; virginity murders itself, and should be buried in highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites, much like a cheese, consumes itself to the very paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach. Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the canon. Keep it not, you cannot choose but lose by’t. Out with’t! Within t’ one year it will make itself two, which is a goodly increase, and the principal itself not much the worse. Away with’t!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HEL.">
  <li data-number="80">How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAR.">
  <li>Let me see. Marry, ill, to like him that ne’er it likes. ’Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with lying: the longer kept, the less worth. Off with’t while ’tis vendible; answer the time of request. Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out of fashion, richly suited, but unsuitable—just like the brooch and the toothpick, which wear not now. Your date is better in your pie and your porridge than in your cheek; and your virginity, your old virginity, is like one of our French wither’d pears, it looks ill, it eats drily, marry, ’tis a wither’d pear; it was formerly better, marry, yet ’tis a wither’d pear. Will you any thing with it?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HEL.">
  <li>Not my virginity yet:</li>
  <li>There shall your master have a thousand loves,</li>
  <li>A mother, and a mistress, and a friend,</li>
  <li data-number="85">A phoenix, captain, and an enemy,</li>
  <li>A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,</li>
  <li>A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;</li>
  <li>His humble ambition, proud humility;</li>
  <li>His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet;</li>
  <li data-number="90">His faith, his sweet disaster; with a world</li>
  <li>Of pretty, fond, adoptions christendoms</li>
  <li>That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he—</li>
  <li>I know not what he shall—God send him well!</li>
  <li>The court’s a learning place, and he is one—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAR.">
  <li data-number="95">What one, i’ faith?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HEL.">
  <li>That I wish well. ’Tis pity—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAR.">
  <li>What’s pity?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HEL.">
  <li>That wishing well had not a body in’t,</li>
  <li>Which might be felt, that we, the poorer born,</li>
  <li data-number="100">Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,</li>
  <li>Might with effects of them follow our friends,</li>
  <li>And show what we alone must think, which never</li>
  <li>Returns us thanks.</li>

  <li>Truly, madam, if God have lent a man any manners, he may easily put it off at court.

<ol data-speaker="2. LORD. DUM.">
  <li>Nay, good my lord, put him to’t; let him have his way.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. LORD. DUM.">
  <li>If your lordship find him not a hilding, hold me no more in your respect.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. LORD. DUM.">
  <li>On my life, my lord, a bubble.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BER.">
  <li>Do you think I am so far deceiv’d in him?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. LORD. DUM.">
  <li data-number="5">Believe it, my lord, in mine own direct knowledge, without any malice, but to speak of him as my kinsman, he’s a most notable coward, an infinite and endless liar, an hourly promise-breaker, the owner of no one good quality worthy your lordship’s entertainment.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. LORD. DUM.">
  <li>It were fit you knew him, lest reposing too far in his virtue, which he hath not, he might at some great and trusty business in a main danger fail you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BER.">
  <li>I would I knew in what particular action to try him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. LORD. DUM.">
  <li>None better than to let him fetch off his drum, which you hear him so confidently undertake to do.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. LORD. DUM.">
  <li>I, with a troop of Florentines, will suddenly surprise him; such I will have, whom I am sure he knows not from the enemy. We will bind and hoodwink him so, that he shall suppose no other but that he is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries, when we bring him to our own tents. Be but your lordship present at his examination, if he do not, for the promise of his life, and in the highest compulsion of base fear, offer to betray you, and deliver all the intelligence in his power against you, and that with the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath, never trust my judgment in any thing.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. LORD. DUM.">
  <li data-number="10">O, for the love of laughter, let him fetch his drum; he says he has a stratagem for’t. When your lordship sees the bottom of his success in’t, and to what metal this counterfeit lump of ore will be melted, if you give him not John Drum’s entertainment, your inclining cannot be remov’d. Here he comes.</li>

<ol data-speaker="BER.">
  <li>How now, <foreign xml:lang="fr">monsieur</foreign>? This drum sticks sorely in your disposition.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. LORD. DUM.">
  <li>A pox on’t, let it go, ’tis but a drum.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAR.">
  <li>But a drum! Is’t but a drum? A drum so lost! There was excellent command—to charge in with our horse upon our own wings, and to rend our own soldiers!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. LORD. DUM.">
  <li data-number="15">That was not to be blam’d in the command of the service; it was a disaster of war that Caesar himself could not have prevented, if he had been there to command.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BER.">
  <li>Well, we cannot greatly condemn our success. Some dishonor we had in the loss of that drum, but it is not to be recover’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAR.">
  <li>It might have been recover’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BER.">
  <li>It might, but it is not now.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAR.">
  <li>It is to be recover’d. But that the merit of service is seldom attributed to the true and exact performer, I would have that drum or another, or <foreign xml:lang="la">hic jacet</foreign>.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BER.">
  <li data-number="20">Why, if you have a stomach, to’t, <foreign xml:lang="fr">monsieur</foreign>: if you think your mystery in stratagem can bring this instrument of honor again into his native quarter, be magnanimious in the enterprise and go on; I will grace the attempt for a worthy exploit. If you speed well in it, the Duke shall both speak of it, and extend to you what further becomes his greatness, even to the utmost syllable of your worthiness.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAR.">
  <li>By the hand of a soldier, I will undertake it.</li>

  <li>But you must not now slumber in it.</li>

<ol data-speaker="PAR.">
  <li>I’ll about it this evening, and I will presently pen down my dilemmas, encourage myself in my certainty, put myself into my mortal preparation; and by midnight look to hear further from me.</li>

  <li>May I be bold to acquaint his Grace you are gone about it?</li>

<ol data-speaker="1. LORD. DUM.">
  <li>You do not know him, my lord, as we do. Certain it is that he will steal himself into a man’s favor, and for a week escape a great deal of discoveries, but when you find him out, you have him ever after.</li>

  <li>None in the world, but return with an invention, and clap upon you two or three probable lies. But we have almost emboss’d him, you shall see his fall tonight; for indeed he is not for your lordship’s respect.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. LORD. DUM.">
  <li>We’ll make you some sport with the fox ere we case him. He was first smok’d by the old Lord Lafew. When his disguise and he is parted, tell me what a sprat you shall find him, which you shall see this very night.</li>

  <li>You have not given him his mother’s letter?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. LORD. DUM.">
  <li>I have deliv’red it an hour since. There is something in’t that stings his nature; for on the reading it he chang’d almost into another man.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. LORD. DUM.">
  <li>He has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking off so good a wife and so sweet a lady.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. LORD. DUM.">
  <li>Especially he hath incurr’d the everlasting displeasure of the King, who had even tun’d his bounty to sing happiness to him. I will tell you a thing, but you shall let it dwell darkly with you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. LORD. DUM.">
  <li data-number="5">When you have spoken it, ’tis dead, and I am the grave of it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. LORD. DUM.">
  <li>He hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in Florence, of a most chaste renown, and this night he fleshes his will in the spoil of her honor. He hath given her his monumental ring, and thinks himself made in the unchaste composition.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. LORD. DUM.">
  <li>Now God delay our rebellion! As we are ourselves, what things are we!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. LORD. DUM.">
  <li>Merely our own traitors. And as in the common course of all treasons, we still see them reveal themselves, till they attain to their abhorr’d ends; so he that in this action contrives against his own nobility in his proper stream o’erflows himself.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. LORD. DUM.">
  <li>Is it not meant damnable in us, to be trumpeters of our unlawful intents? We shall not then have his company tonight?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. LORD. DUM.">
  <li data-number="10">Not till after midnight; for he is dieted to his hour.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. LORD. DUM.">
  <li>That approaches apace. I would gladly have him see his company anatomiz’d, that he might take a measure of his own judgments, wherein so curiously he had set this counterfeit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. LORD. DUM.">
  <li>We will not meddle with him till he come; for his presence must be the whip of the other.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. LORD. DUM.">
  <li>In the meantime, what hear you of these wars?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. LORD. DUM.">
  <li>I hear there is an overture of peace.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. LORD. DUM.">
  <li data-number="15">Nay, I assure you a peace concluded.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. LORD. DUM.">
  <li>What will Count Roussillon do then? Will he travel higher, or return again into France?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. LORD. DUM.">
  <li>I perceive by this demand, you are not altogether of his counsel.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. LORD. DUM.">
  <li>Let it be forbid, sir, so should I be a great deal of his act.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. LORD. DUM.">
  <li>Sir, his wife some two months since fled from his house. Her pretense is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques le Grand; which holy undertaking with most austere sanctimony she accomplish’d; and there residing, the tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her grief; in fine, made a groan of her last breath, and now she sings in heaven.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. LORD. DUM.">
  <li data-number="20">How is this justified?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. LORD. DUM.">
  <li>The stronger part of it by her own letters, which makes her story true, even to the point of her death. Her death itself, which could not be her office to say is come, was faithfully confirm’d by the rector of the place.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. LORD. DUM.">
  <li>Hath the Count all this intelligence?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. LORD. DUM.">
  <li>Ay, and the particular confirmations, point from point, to the full arming of the verity.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. LORD. DUM.">
  <li>I am heartily sorry that he’ll be glad of this.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. LORD. DUM.">
  <li data-number="25">How mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. LORD. DUM.">
  <li>And how mightily some other times we drown our gain in tears! The great dignity that his valor hath here acquir’d for him shall at home be encount’red with a shame as ample.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. LORD. DUM.">
  <li>The web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and ill together: our virtues would be proud, if our faults whipt them not, and our crimes would despair, if they were not cherish’d by our virtues.</li>
