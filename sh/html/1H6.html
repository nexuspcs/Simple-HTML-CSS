  <li data-number="5">That have consented unto Henry’s death:</li>
  <li>King Henry the Fifth, too famous to live long!</li>
  <li>England ne’er lost a king of so much worth.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li>England ne’er had a king until his time:</li>
  <li>Virtue he had, deserving to command;</li>
  <li data-number="10">His brandish’d sword did blind men with his beams;</li>
  <li>His arms spread wider than a dragon’s wings;</li>
  <li>His sparkling eyes, replete with wrathful fire,</li>
  <li>More dazzled and drove back his enemies</li>
  <li>Than midday sun fierce bent against their faces.</li>
  <li data-number="15">What should I say? His deeds exceed all speech:</li>
  <li>He ne’er lift up his hand but conquered.</li>

  <li>We mourn in black, why mourn we not in blood?</li>
  <li>Henry is dead, and never shall revive.</li>
  <li>Upon a wooden coffin we attend,</li>
  <li data-number="20">And death’s dishonorable victory</li>
  <li>We with our stately presence glorify,</li>
  <li>Like captives bound to a triumphant car.</li>
  <li>What? Shall we curse the planets of mishap</li>
  <li>That plotted thus our glory’s overthrow?</li>
  <li data-number="25">Or shall we think the subtile-witted French</li>
  <li>Conjurers and sorcerers, that, afraid of him,</li>
  <li>By magic verses have contriv’d his end?</li>

  <li>He was a king blest of the King of kings.</li>
  <li>Unto the French the dreadful Judgment Day</li>
  <li data-number="30">So dreadful will not be as was his sight.</li>
  <li>The battles of the Lord of hosts he fought;</li>
  <li>The Church’s prayers made him so prosperous.</li>

  <li>Cease, cease these jars and rest your minds in peace.</li>
  <li data-number="45">Let’s to the altar. Heralds, wait on us.</li>
  <li>In stead of gold, we’ll offer up our arms,</li>
  <li>Since arms avail not now that Henry’s dead.</li>
  <li>Posterity, await for wretched years,</li>
  <li>When at their mothers’ moist’ned eyes babes shall suck,</li>
  <li data-number="50">Our isle be made a nourish of salt tears,</li>
  <li>And none but women left to wail the dead.</li>
  <li>Henry the Fifth, thy ghost I invocate:</li>

  <li>My honorable lords, health to you all!</li>
  <li>Sad tidings bring I to you out of France,</li>

  <li>My gracious lords, to add to your laments,</li>
  <li>Wherewith you now bedew King Henry’s hearse,</li>
  <li data-number="105">I must inform you of a dismal fight</li>
  <li>Betwixt the stout Lord Talbot and the French.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WIN.">
  <li>What? Wherein Talbot overcame, is’t so?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="3. MESS.">
  <li>O no; wherein Lord Talbot was o’er-thrown.</li>
  <li>The circumstance I’ll tell you more at large.</li>
  <li data-number="110">The tenth of August last this dreadful lord,</li>
  <li>Retiring from the siege of Orléans,</li>
  <li>Having full scarce six thousand in his troop,</li>
  <li>By three and twenty thousand of the French</li>
  <li>Was round encompassed, and set upon.</li>
  <li data-number="115">No leisure had he to enrank his men;</li>
  <li>He wanted pikes to set before his archers;</li>
  <li>In stead whereof sharp stakes pluck’d out of hedges</li>
  <li>They pitched in the ground confusedly,</li>
  <li>To keep the horsemen off from breaking in.</li>
  <li data-number="120">More than three hours the fight continued,</li>
  <li>Where valiant Talbot above human thought</li>
  <li>Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:</li>
  <li>Hundreds he sent to hell, and none durst stand him;</li>
  <li>Here, there, and every where, enrag’d he slew.</li>
  <li data-number="125">The French exclaim’d, the devil was in arms;</li>
  <li>All the whole army stood agaz’d on him.</li>
  <li>His soldiers, spying his undaunted spirit,</li>
  <li>“A Talbot! A Talbot!” cried out amain,</li>
  <li>And rush’d into the bowels of the battle.</li>
  <li data-number="130">Here had the conquest fully been seal’d up,</li>
  <li>If Sir John Falstaff had not play’d the coward.</li>
  <li>He, being in the vaward, plac’d behind</li>
  <li>With purpose to relieve and follow them,</li>
  <li>Cowardly fled, not having struck one stroke.</li>
  <li data-number="135">Hence grew the general wrack and massacre;</li>
  <li>Enclosed were they with their enemies.</li>
  <li>A base Wallon, to win the Dauphin’s grace,</li>
  <li>Thrust Talbot with a spear into the back,</li>
  <li>Whom all France with their chief assembled strength</li>
  <li data-number="140">Durst not presume to look once in the face.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BED.">
  <li>Is Talbot slain then? I will slay myself</li>
  <li>For living idly here in pomp and ease,</li>
  <li>Whilst such a worthy leader, wanting aid,</li>
  <li>Unto his dastard foemen is betray’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="3. MESS.">
  <li data-number="145">O no, he lives, but is took prisoner,</li>
  <li>And Lord Scales with him, and Lord Hungerford.</li>
  <li>Most of the rest slaughter’d or took likewise.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BED.">
  <li>His ransom there is none but I shall pay:</li>
  <li>I’ll hale the Dauphin headlong from his throne,</li>
  <li data-number="150">His crown shall be the ransom of my friend;</li>
  <li>Four of their lords I’ll change for one of ours.</li>
  <li>Farewell, my masters, to my task will I.</li>
  <li>Bonfires in France forthwith I am to make,</li>
  <li>To keep our great Saint George’s feast withal.</li>
  <li data-number="155">Ten thousand soldiers with me I will take,</li>
  <li>Whose bloody deeds shall make all Europe quake.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="3. MESS.">
  <li>So you had need, for Orléans is besieg’d;</li>
  <li>The English army is grown weak and faint;</li>

  <li>Was, for that (young Richard thus remov’d,</li>

  <li>I was the next by birth and parentage;</li>

  <li>But mark: as in this haughty great attempt</li>
  <li data-number="80">They labored to plant the rightful heir,</li>
  <li>I lost my liberty, and they their lives.</li>
  <li>Long after this, when Henry the Fifth</li>
  <li>(Succeeding his father Bullingbrook) did reign,</li>
  <li>Thy father, Earl of Cambridge then, deriv’d</li>
  <li data-number="85">From famous Edmund Langley, Duke of York,</li>

  <li>And have install’d me in the diadem.</li>
  <li data-number="90">But as the rest, so fell that noble earl,</li>
  <li>And was beheaded. Thus the Mortimers,</li>
  <li>In whom the title rested, were suppress’d.</li>

  <li>Of which, my lord, your honor is the last.</li>

  <li>Thou art my heir; the rest I wish thee gather;</li>

  <li>Thy grave admonishments prevail with me.</li>

  <li>Your wondrous rare description, noble Earl,</li>

  <li>Her virtues, graced with external gifts,</li>

<ol data-speaker="SUF.">
  <li data-number="10">Tush, my good lord, this superficial tale</li>

  <li>That he should be so abject, base, and poor,</li>
  <li data-number="50">To choose for wealth and not for perfect love.</li>
  <li>Henry is able to enrich his queen,</li>
  <li>And not to seek a queen to make him rich:</li>
  <li>So worthless peasants bargain for their wives,</li>
  <li>As market men for oxen, sheep, or horse.</li>
  <li data-number="55">Marriage is a matter of more worth</li>
  <li>Than to be dealt in by attorneyship.</li>
  <li>Not whom we will, but whom his Grace affects,</li>
  <li>Must be companion of his nuptial bed.</li>
  <li>And therefore, lords, since he affects her most,</li>
  <li data-number="60">Most of all these reasons bindeth us</li>
  <li>In our opinions she should be preferr’d.</li>
  <li>For what is wedlock forced, but a hell,</li>
  <li>An age of discord and continual strife?</li>
  <li>Whereas the contrary bringeth bliss,</li>
  <li data-number="65">And is a pattern of celestial peace.</li>
  <li>Whom should we match with Henry, being a king,</li>
  <li>But Margaret, that is daughter to a king?</li>
  <li>Her peerless feature, joined with her birth,</li>
  <li>Approves her fit for none but for a king.</li>
  <li data-number="70">Her valiant courage and undaunted spirit</li>
  <li>(More than in women commonly is seen)</li>
  <li>Will answer our hope in issue of a king;</li>
  <li>For Henry, son unto a conqueror,</li>
  <li>Is likely to beget more conquerors,</li>
  <li data-number="75">If with a lady of so high resolve</li>
  <li>(As is fair Margaret) he be link’d in love.</li>
  <li>Then yield, my lords, and here conclude with me</li>
  <li>That Margaret shall be Queen, and none but she.</li>

  <li>Whether it be through force of your report,</li>
  <li data-number="80">My noble Lord of Suffolk, or for that</li>
  <li>My tender youth was never yet attaint</li>
  <li>With any passion of inflaming love,</li>
  <li>I cannot tell; but this I am assur’d,</li>
  <li>I feel such sharp dissension in my breast,</li>
  <li data-number="85">Such fierce alarums both of hope and fear,</li>
  <li>As I am sick with working of my thoughts.</li>
  <li>Take therefore shipping, post, my lord, to France,</li>
  <li>Agree to any covenants, and procure</li>
  <li>That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come</li>
  <li data-number="90">To cross the seas to England and be crown’d</li>
  <li>King Henry’s faithful and anointed queen.</li>
  <li>For your expenses and sufficient charge,</li>
  <li>Among the people gather up a tenth.</li>
  <li>Be gone, I say, for till you do return,</li>
  <li data-number="95">I rest perplexed with a thousand cares.</li>
  <li>And you, good uncle, banish all offense.</li>
  <li>If you do censure me by what you were,</li>
  <li>Not what you are, I know it will excuse</li>
  <li>This sudden execution of my will.</li>
