<h1 id="title">Shall I Die?</h1>


<section class="stanza">
  <p>Shall I die? Shall I fly</p>
  <p>Lovers’ baits and deceits</p>
  <p>sorrow breeding?</p>
  <p>Shall I tend? Shall I send?</p>
  <p>Shall I sue, and not rue</p>
  <p>my proceeding?</p>
  <p>In all duty her beauty</p>
  <p>Binds me her servant for ever.</p>
  <p>If she scorn, I mourn,</p>
  <p>I retire to despair, joining never.</p>

<section class="stanza">
  <p>Yet I must vent my lust</p>
  <p>And explain inward pain</p>
  <p>by my love conceiving.</p>
  <p>If she smiles, she exiles</p>
  <p>All my moan; if she froan,</p>
  <p>all my hopes deceiving—</p>
  <p>Suspicious doubt, O keep out,</p>
  <p>For thou art my tormentor.</p>
  <p>Fie away, pack away;</p>
  <p>I will love, for hope bids me venture.</p>

<section class="stanza">
  <p>’Twere abuse to accuse</p>
  <p>My fair love, ere I prove</p>
  <p>her affection.</p>
  <p>Therefore try! Her reply</p>
  <p>Gives me joy—or annoy,</p>
  <p>or affliction.</p>
  <p>Yet howe’er, I will bear</p>
  <p>Her pleasure with patience, for beauty</p>
  <p>Sure will not seem to blot</p>
  <p>Her deserts, wronging him doth her duty.</p>

  <p>In a dream it did seem—</p>
  <p>But alas, dreams do pass</p>
  <p>as do shadows—</p>
  <p>I did walk, I did talk</p>
  <p>With my love, with my dove</p>
  <p>through fair meadows.</p>
  <p>Still we passed till at last</p>
  <p>We sat to repose us for pleasure.</p>
  <p>Being set, lips met,</p>
  <p>Arms twined, and did bind my heart’s treasure.</p>

<section class="stanza">
  <p>Gentle wind sport did find</p>
  <p>Wantonly to make fly</p>
  <p>her gold tresses.</p>
  <p>As they shook I did look,</p>
  <p>But her fair did impair</p>
  <p>all my senses.</p>
  <p>As amazed, I gazed</p>
  <p>On more than a mortal complexion.</p>
  <p>You that love can prove</p>
  <p>Such force in beauty’s inflection.</p>

<section class="stanza">
  <p>Next her hair, forehead fair,</p>
  <p>Smooth and high; neat doth lie,</p>
  <p>without wrinkle,</p>
  <p>Her fair brows; under those,</p>
  <p>Star-like eyes win love’s prize</p>
  <p>when they twinkle.</p>
  <p>In her cheeks who seeks</p>
  <p>Shall find there displayed beauty’s banner;</p>
  <p>O admiring desiring</p>
  <p>Breeds, as I look still upon her.</p>

  <p>Thin lips red, fancy’s fed</p>
  <p>With all sweets when he meets,</p>
  <p>and is granted</p>
  <p>There to trade, and is made</p>
  <p>Happy, sure, to endure</p>
  <p>still undaunted.</p>
  <p>Pretty chin doth win</p>
  <p>Of all their culled commendations;</p>
  <p>Fairest neck, no speck;</p>
  <p>All her parts merit high admirations.</p>

<section class="stanza">
  <p>Pretty bare, past compare,</p>
  <p>Parts those plots which besots</p>
  <p>still asunder.</p>
  <p>It is meet naught but sweet</p>
  <p>Should come near that so rare</p>
  <p>’tis a wonder.</p>
  <p>No mis-shape, no scape</p>
  <p>Inferior to nature’s perfection;</p>
  <p>No blot, no spot:</p>
  <p>She’s beauty’s queen in election.</p>

  <p>Whilst I dreamt, I, exempt</p>
  <p>From all care, seemed to share</p>
  <p>pleasure’s plenty;</p>
  <p>But awake, care take—</p>
  <p>For I find to my mind</p>
  <p>pleasures scanty.</p>
  <p>Therefore I will try</p>
  <p>To compass my heart’s chief contenting.</p>
  <p>To delay, some say,</p>
  <p>In such a cause causeth repenting.</p>
