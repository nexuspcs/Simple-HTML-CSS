  <li>Gregory, on my word, we’ll not carry coals.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRE.">
  <li>No, for then we should be colliers.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SAM.">
  <li>I mean, and we be in choler, we’ll draw.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRE.">
  <li>Ay, while you live, draw your neck out of collar.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SAM.">
  <li data-number="5">I strike quickly, being mov’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRE.">
  <li>But thou art not quickly mov’d to strike.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SAM.">
  <li>A dog of the house of Montague moves me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRE.">
  <li>To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand; therefore, if thou art mov’d, thou run’st away.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SAM.">
  <li>A dog of that house shall move me to stand! I will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague’s.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRE.">
  <li data-number="10">That shows thee a weak slave, for the weakest goes to the wall.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SAM.">
  <li>’Tis true, and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are ever thrust to the wall; therefore I will push Montague’s men from the wall, and thrust his maids to the wall.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRE.">
  <li>The quarrel is between our masters, and us their men.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SAM.">
  <li>’Tis all one; I will show myself a tyrant: when I have fought with the men, I will be civil with the maids; I will cut off their heads.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRE.">
  <li>The heads of the maids?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SAM.">
  <li data-number="15">Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads, take it in what sense thou wilt.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRE.">
  <li>They must take it in sense that feel it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SAM.">
  <li>Me they shall feel while I am able to stand, and ’tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRE.">
  <li>’Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst been poor-John. Draw thy tool, here comes two of the house of Montagues.</li>

  <li>Let us take the law of our sides, let them begin.</li>

  <li>I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.</li>

<ol data-speaker="SAM.">
  <li data-number="25">Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them, which is disgrace to them if they bear it.</li>

  <li>Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?</li>

  <li>Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?</li>
  <li>Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEN.">
  <li>Here were the servants of your adversary,</li>
  <li>And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.</li>
  <li data-number="85">I drew to part them. In the instant came</li>
  <li>The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar’d,</li>
  <li>Which, as he breath’d defiance to my ears,</li>
  <li>He swung about his head and cut the winds,</li>
  <li>Who, nothing hurt withal, hiss’d him in scorn.</li>
  <li data-number="90">While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,</li>
  <li>Came more and more, and fought on part and part,</li>
  <li>Till the Prince came, who parted either part.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LA. MON.">
  <li>O, where is Romeo? Saw you him today?</li>
  <li>Right glad I am he was not at this fray.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEN.">
  <li data-number="95">Madam, an hour before the worshipp’d sun</li>
  <li>Peer’d forth the golden window of the east,</li>
  <li>A troubled mind drive me to walk abroad,</li>
  <li>Where, underneath the grove of sycamore</li>
  <li>That westward rooteth from this city side,</li>
  <li data-number="100">So early walking did I see your son.</li>
  <li>Towards him I made, but he was ware of me,</li>
  <li>And stole into the covert of the wood.</li>
  <li>I, measuring his affections by my own,</li>
  <li>Which then most sought where most might not be found,</li>
  <li data-number="105">Being one too many by my weary self,</li>
  <li>Pursued my humor not pursuing his,</li>
  <li>And gladly shunn’d who gladly fled from me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MON.">
  <li>Many a morning hath he there been seen,</li>
  <li>With tears augmenting the fresh morning’s dew,</li>
  <li data-number="110">Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs,</li>
  <li>But all so soon as the all-cheering sun</li>
  <li>Should in the farthest east begin to draw</li>
  <li>The shady curtains from Aurora’s bed,</li>
  <li>Away from light steals home my heavy son,</li>
  <li data-number="115">And private in his chamber pens himself,</li>
  <li>Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out,</li>
  <li>And makes himself an artificial night.</li>
  <li>Black and portendous must this humor prove,</li>
  <li>Unless good counsel may the cause remove.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEN.">
  <li data-number="120">My noble uncle, do you know the cause?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MON.">
  <li>I neither know it, nor can learn of him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEN.">
  <li>Have you importun’d him by any means?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MON.">
  <li>Both by myself and many other friends,</li>
  <li>But he, his own affections’ counsellor,</li>
  <li data-number="125">Is to himself (I will not say how true)</li>
  <li>But to himself so secret and so close,</li>
  <li>So far from sounding and discovery,</li>
  <li>As is the bud bit with an envious worm,</li>
  <li>Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air</li>
  <li data-number="130">Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.</li>
  <li>Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,</li>
  <li>We would as willingly give cure as know.</li>

  <li>See where he comes. So please you step aside,</li>
  <li>I’ll know his grievance, or be much denied.</li>

  <li>Good morrow, cousin.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROM.">
  <li data-offset="4">Is the day so young?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEN.">
  <li>But new struck nine.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROM.">
  <li data-offset="4">Ay me, sad hours seem long.</li>
  <li>Was that my father that went hence so fast?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEN.">
  <li data-number="140">It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo’s hours?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROM.">
  <li>Not having that which, having, makes them short.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEN.">
  <li>In love?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROM.">
  <li>Out—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEN.">
  <li>Of love?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROM.">
  <li data-number="145">Out of her favor where I am in love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEN.">
  <li>Alas that love, so gentle in his view,</li>
  <li>Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROM.">
  <li>Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,</li>
  <li>Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!</li>
  <li data-number="150">Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?</li>
  <li>Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all:</li>
  <li>Here’s much to do with hate, but more with love.</li>
  <li>Why then, O brawling love! O loving hate!</li>
  <li>O any thing, of nothing first create!</li>
  <li data-number="155">O heavy lightness, serious vanity,</li>
  <li>Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms,</li>
  <li>Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health,</li>
  <li>Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!</li>
  <li>This love feel I, that feel no love in this.</li>
  <li>Dost thou not laugh?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEN.">
  <li data-offset="4">No, coz, I rather weep.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROM.">
  <li>Good heart, at what?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEN.">
  <li data-offset="4">At thy good heart’s oppression.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROM.">
  <li>Why, such is love’s transgression.</li>
  <li>Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,</li>
  <li>Which thou wilt propagate to have it press’d</li>
  <li data-number="165">With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown</li>
  <li>Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.</li>
  <li>Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs,</li>
  <li>Being purg’d, a fire sparkling in lovers’ eyes,</li>
  <li>Being vex’d, a sea nourish’d with loving tears.</li>
  <li data-number="170">What is it else? A madness most discreet,</li>
  <li>A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.</li>
  <li>Farewell, my coz.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEN.">
  <li data-offset="4">Soft, I will go along;</li>
  <li>And if you leave me so, you do me wrong.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROM.">
  <li>Tut, I have lost myself, I am not here:</li>
  <li data-number="175">This is not Romeo, he’s some other where.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEN.">
  <li>Tell me in sadness, who is that you love?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROM.">
  <li>What, shall I groan and tell thee?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEN.">
  <li data-offset="6">Groan? Why, no;</li>
  <li>But sadly tell me, who?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROM.">
  <li>Bid a sick man in sadness make his will—</li>
  <li data-number="180">A word ill urg’d to one that is so ill!</li>
  <li>In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEN.">
  <li>I aim’d so near when I suppos’d you lov’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROM.">
  <li>A right good mark-man! And she’s fair I love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEN.">
  <li>A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROM.">
  <li data-number="185">Well, in that hit you miss: she’ll not be hit</li>
  <li>With Cupid’s arrow, she hath Dian’s wit;</li>
  <li>And in strong proof of chastity well arm’d,</li>
  <li>From Love’s weak childish bow she lives uncharm’d.</li>
  <li>She will not stay the siege of loving terms,</li>
  <li data-number="190">Nor bide th’ encounter of assailing eyes,</li>
  <li>Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.</li>
  <li>O, she is rich in beauty, only poor</li>
  <li>That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEN.">
  <li>Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROM.">
  <li data-number="195">She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;</li>
  <li>For beauty starv’d with her severity</li>
  <li>Cuts beauty off from all posterity.</li>
  <li>She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,</li>
  <li>To merit bliss by making me despair.</li>
  <li data-number="200">She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow</li>
  <li>Do I live dead that live to tell it now.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEN.">
  <li>Be rul’d by me, forget to think of her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROM.">
  <li>O, teach me how I should forget to think.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEN.">
  <li>By giving liberty unto thine eyes:</li>
  <li>Examine other beauties.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROM.">
  <li data-number="205" data-offset="5">’Tis the way</li>
  <li>To call hers (exquisite) in question more.</li>
  <li>These happy masks that kiss fair ladies’ brows,</li>
  <li>Being black, puts us in mind they hide the fair.</li>
  <li>He that is strucken blind cannot forget</li>
  <li data-number="210">The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.</li>
  <li>Show me a mistress that is passing fair,</li>
  <li>What doth her beauty serve but as a note</li>
  <li>Where I may read who pass’d that passing fair?</li>
  <li>Farewell, thou canst not teach me to forget.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEN.">
  <li data-number="215">I’ll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.</li>

  <li>Not half so big as a round little worm</li>
  <li>Prick’d from the lazy finger of a maid.</li>
  <li data-number="70">And in this state she gallops night by night</li>

  <li>O’er lawyers’ fingers, who straight dream on fees;</li>
  <li>O’er ladies’ lips, who straight on kisses dream,</li>
  <li data-number="75">Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,</li>
  <li>Because their breath with sweetmeats tainted are.</li>
  <li>Sometime she gallops o’er a courtier’s nose,</li>

  <li>And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig’s tail</li>
  <li data-number="80">Tickling a parson’s nose as ’a lies asleep,</li>
  <li>Then he dreams of another benefice.</li>
  <li>Sometime she driveth o’er a soldier’s neck,</li>

  <li>Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,</li>
  <li data-number="85">Of healths five fathom deep; and then anon</li>
  <li>Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,</li>
  <li>And being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two,</li>
  <li>And sleeps again. This is that very Mab</li>
  <li>That plats the manes of horses in the night,</li>
  <li data-number="90">And bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs,</li>
  <li>Which, once untangled, much misfortune bodes.</li>
  <li>This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,</li>

		MER.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="MER.">
  <li>Where the dev’l should this Romeo be?</li>
  <li>Came he not home tonight?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEN.">
  <li>Not to his father’s, I spoke with his man.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MER.">
  <li>Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline,</li>
  <li data-number="5">Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEN.">
  <li>Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet,</li>
  <li>Hath sent a letter to his father’s house.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MER.">
  <li>A challenge, on my life.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEN.">
  <li>Romeo will answer it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MER.">
  <li data-number="10">Any man that can write may answer a letter.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEN.">
  <li>Nay, he will answer the letter’s master, how he dares, being dar’d.</li>

  <li>Alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead, stabb’d with a white wench’s black eye, run through the ear with a love-song, the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy’s butt-shaft; and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEN.">
  <li>Why, what is Tybalt?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MER.">
  <li>More than Prince of Cats. O, he’s the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and proportion; he rests his minim rests, one, two, and the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist; 
a gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause. Ah, the immortal <foreign xml:lang="it">passado</foreign>, the <foreign xml:lang="it">punto reverso</foreign>, the <foreign xml:lang="it">hay</foreign>!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEN.">
  <li data-number="15">The what?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MER.">
  <li>The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting phantasimes, these new tuners of accent! “By Jesu, a very good blade! A very tall man! A very good whore!” Why, is not this a lamentable thing, grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these pardon-me’s, who stand so much on the new form, that they cannot sit at ease on the old bench? O, their bones, their bones!</li>

  <li>Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great, and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.</li>

  <li>Swits and spurs, swits and spurs, or I’ll cry a match.</li>

  <li>Nay, good goose, bite not.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MER.">
  <li>Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting, it is a most sharp sauce.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROM.">
  <li>And is it not then well serv’d in to a sweet goose?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MER.">
  <li data-number="40">O, here’s a wit of cheverel, that stretches from an inch narrow to an ell broad!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROM.">
  <li>I stretch it out for that word “broad,” which, added to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MER.">
  <li>Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? Now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature, for this drivelling love is like a great natural that runs lolling up and down to hide his bable in a hole.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEN.">
  <li>Stop there, stop there.</li>

  <li>I saw no man use you at his pleasure; if I had, my weapon should quickly have been out. I warrant you, I dare draw as soon as another man, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the law on my side.</li>

<ol data-speaker="NURSE.">
  <li>Now, afore God, I am so vex’d that every part about me quivers. Scurvy knave! 
Pray you, sir, a word: and as I told you, my young lady bid me inquire you out; what she bid me say, I will keep to myself. But first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her in a fool’s paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behavior, as they say; for the gentlewoman is young; and therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing to be off’red to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.</li>

  <li>Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady—Lord, Lord! When ’twas a little prating thing—O, there is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief see a toad, a very toad, as see him. 
I anger her sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer man, but I’ll warrant you, when I say so, she looks as pale as any clout in the versal world. 
Doth not rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?</li>

Thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarreling. Thou hast quarrell’d with a man for coughing in the street, because he hath waken’d thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun.

  <li>And if thou darest, I’ll give thee remedy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JUL.">
  <li>O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,</li>
  <li>From off the battlements of any tower,</li>
  <li>Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk</li>
  <li data-number="80">Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears,</li>
  <li>Or hide me nightly in a charnel-house,</li>
  <li>O’ercover’d quite with dead men’s rattling bones,</li>
  <li>With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;</li>
  <li>Or bid me go into a new-made grave,</li>
  <li data-number="85">And hide me with a dead man in his shroud—</li>
  <li>Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble—</li>
  <li>And I will do it without fear or doubt,</li>
  <li>To live an unstain’d wife to my sweet love.</li>

  <li data-number="95">When presently through all thy veins shall run</li>
  <li>A cold and drowsy humor; for no pulse</li>
  <li>Shall keep his native progress, but surcease;</li>
  <li>No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest;</li>
  <li>The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade</li>
  <li data-number="100">To wanny ashes, thy eyes’ windows fall,</li>
  <li>Like death when he shuts up the day of life;</li>
  <li>Each part, depriv’d of supple government,</li>

  <li>And in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death</li>
  <li data-number="105">Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,</li>
  <li>And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.</li>
  <li>Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes</li>
  <li>To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.</li>
  <li>Then, as the manner of our country is,</li>
  <li data-number="110">In thy best robes, uncovered on the bier,</li>
  <li>Thou shall be borne to that same ancient vault</li>
  <li>Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.</li>
  <li>In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,</li>
  <li>Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,</li>
  <li data-number="115">And hither shall he come, an’ he and I</li>
  <li>Will watch thy waking, and that very night</li>
  <li>Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.</li>
  <li>And this shall free thee from this present shame,</li>
  <li>If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,</li>
  <li data-number="120">Abate thy valor in the acting it.</li>

  <li>Then gave I her (so tutor’d by my art)</li>
  <li>A sleeping potion, which so took effect</li>
  <li>As I intended, for it wrought on her</li>
  <li data-number="245">The form of death. Mean time I writ to Romeo,</li>
  <li>That he should hither come as this dire night</li>
  <li>To help to take her from her borrowed grave,</li>
  <li>Being the time the potion’s force should cease.</li>
  <li>But he which bore my letter, Friar John,</li>
  <li data-number="250">Was stayed by accident, and yesternight</li>
  <li>Return’d my letter back. Then all alone,</li>
  <li>At the prefixed hour of her waking,</li>
  <li>Came I to take her from her kindred’s vault,</li>
  <li>Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,</li>
  <li data-number="255">Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.</li>
  <li>But when I came, some minute ere the time</li>
  <li>Of her awakening, here untimely lay</li>
  <li>The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.</li>
  <li>She wakes, and I entreated her come forth</li>
  <li data-number="260">And bear this work of heaven with patience.</li>
  <li>But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,</li>
  <li>And she, too desperate, would not go with me,</li>
  <li>But as it seems, did violence on herself.</li>
  <li>All this I know, and to the marriage</li>
  <li data-number="265">Her nurse is privy; and if aught in this</li>
  <li>Miscarried by my fault, let my old life</li>
  <li>Be sacrific’d some hour before his time,</li>
  <li>Unto the rigor of severest law.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRIN.">
  <li>We still have known thee for a holy man.</li>
  <li data-number="270">Where’s Romeo’s man? What can he say to this?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAL.">
  <li>I brought my master news of Juliet’s death,</li>
  <li>And then in post he came from Mantua</li>
  <li>To this same place, to this same monument.</li>
  <li>This letter he early bid me give his father,</li>
  <li data-number="275">And threat’ned me with death, going in the vault,</li>
  <li>If I departed not and left him there.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRIN.">
  <li>Give me the letter, I will look on it.</li>
  <li>Where is the County’s page that rais’d the watch?</li>
  <li>Sirrah, what made your master in this place?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAGE.">
  <li data-number="280">He came with flowers to strew his lady’s grave,</li>
  <li>And bid me stand aloof, and so I did.</li>
  <li>Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb,</li>
  <li>And by and by my master drew on him,</li>
  <li>And then I ran away to call the watch.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRIN.">
  <li data-number="285">This letter doth make good the friar’s words,</li>
  <li>Their course of love, the tidings of her death;</li>
  <li>And here he writes that he did buy a poison</li>
  <li>Of a poor pothecary, and therewithal</li>
  <li>Came to this vault, to die and lie with Juliet.</li>
  <li data-number="290">Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!</li>
  <li>See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,</li>
  <li>That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.</li>
  <li>And I for winking at your discords too</li>
  <li>Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAP.">
  <li data-number="295">O brother Montague, give me thy hand.</li>
  <li>This is my daughter’s jointure, for no more</li>
  <li>Can I demand.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MON.">
  <li data-offset="3">But I can give thee more,</li>
  <li>For I will raise her statue in pure gold,</li>
  <li>That whiles Verona by that name is known,</li>
  <li data-number="300">There shall no figure at such rate be set</li>
  <li>As that of true and faithful Juliet.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAP.">
  <li>As rich shall Romeo’s by his lady’s lie,</li>
  <li>Poor sacrifices of our enmity!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRIN.">
  <li>A glooming peace this morning with it brings,</li>
  <li data-number="305">The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head.</li>
  <li>Go hence to have more talk of these sad things;</li>
  <li>Some shall be pardon’d, and some punished:</li>
  <li>For never was a story of more woe</li>
  <li>Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.</li>
