<h3>Scene 1</h3>

<h4>Verona. An open place.</h4>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Valentine, Proteus.
	
		VAL.
		PRO.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="VAL.">
  <li>Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus:</li>
  <li>Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits.</li>
  <li>Were’t not affection chains thy tender days</li>
  <li>To the sweet glances of thy honor’d love,</li>
  <li data-number="5">I rather would entreat thy company,</li>
  <li>To see the wonders of the world abroad,</li>
  <li>Than (living dully sluggardiz’d at home)</li>
  <li>Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness.</li>
  <li>But since thou lov’st, love still, and thrive therein,</li>
  <li data-number="10">Even as I would, when I to love begin.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRO.">
  <li>Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, <foreign xml:lang="fr">adieu</foreign>,</li>
  <li>Think on thy Proteus, when thou, happ’ly, seest</li>
  <li>Some rare noteworthy object in thy travel.</li>
  <li>Wish me partaker in thy happiness</li>
  <li data-number="15">When thou dost meet good hap; and in thy danger</li>
  <li>(If ever danger do environ thee)</li>
  <li>Commend thy grievance to my holy prayers,</li>
  <li>For I will be thy beadsman, Valentine.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VAL.">
  <li>And on a love-book pray for my success?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRO.">
  <li data-number="20">Upon some book I love I’ll pray for thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VAL.">
  <li>That’s on some shallow story of deep love,</li>
  <li>How young Leander cross’d the Hellespont.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRO.">
  <li>That’s a deep story of a deeper love,</li>
  <li>For he was more than over shoes in love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VAL.">
  <li data-number="25">’Tis true; for you are over boots in love,</li>
  <li>And yet you never swom the Hellespont.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRO.">
  <li>Over the boots? Nay, give me not the boots.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VAL.">
  <li>No, I will not; for it boots thee not.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRO.">
  <li data-offset="7">What?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VAL.">
  <li>To be in love—where scorn is bought with groans;</li>
  <li data-number="30">Coy looks with heart-sore sighs; one fading moment’s mirth</li>
  <li>With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights:</li>
  <li>If happ’ly won, perhaps a hapless gain;</li>
  <li>If lost, why then a grievous labor won;</li>
  <li>However—but a folly bought with wit,</li>
  <li data-number="35">Or else a wit by folly vanquished.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRO.">
  <li>So, by your circumstance, you call me fool.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VAL.">
  <li>So, by your circumstance, I fear you’ll prove.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRO.">
  <li>’Tis love you cavil at, I am not Love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VAL.">
  <li>Love is your master, for he masters you;</li>
  <li data-number="40">And he that is so yoked by a fool,</li>
  <li>Methinks should not be chronicled for wise.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRO.">
  <li>Yet writers say: as in the sweetest bud</li>
  <li>The eating canker dwells, so eating love</li>
  <li>Inhabits in the finest wits of all.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VAL.">
  <li data-number="45">And writers say: as the most forward bud</li>
  <li>Is eaten by the canker ere it blow,</li>
  <li>Even so by love the young and tender wit</li>
  <li>Is turn’d to folly, blasting in the bud,</li>
  <li>Losing his verdure, even in the prime,</li>
  <li data-number="50">And all the fair effects of future hopes.</li>
  <li>But wherefore waste I time to counsel thee</li>
  <li>That art a votary to fond desire?</li>
  <li>Once more <foreign xml:lang="fr">adieu</foreign>. My father at the road</li>
  <li>Expects my coming, there to see me shipp’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRO.">
  <li data-number="55">And thither will I bring thee, Valentine.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VAL.">
  <li>Sweet Proteus, no; now let us take our leave.</li>
  <li>To Milan let me hear from thee by letters</li>
  <li>Of thy success in love, and what news else</li>
  <li>Betideth here in absence of thy friend;</li>
  <li data-number="60">And I likewise will visit thee with mine.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRO.">
  <li>All happiness bechance to thee in Milan.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VAL.">
  <li>As much to you at home; and so farewell.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Exit.
	
		VAL.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="PRO.">
  <li>He after honor hunts, I after love:</li>
  <li>He leaves his friends, to dignify them more;</li>
  <li data-number="65">I leave myself, my friends, and all, for love.</li>
  <li>Thou, Julia, thou hast metamorphis’d me,</li>
  <li>Made me neglect my studies, lose my time,</li>
  <li>War with good counsel, set the world at nought;</li>
  <li>Made wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Speed.
	
		SPEED.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="SPEED.">
  <li data-number="70">Sir Proteus! ’Save you! Saw you my master?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRO.">
  <li>But now he parted hence to embark for Milan.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SPEED.">
  <li>Twenty to one then he is shipp’d already,</li>
  <li>And I have play’d the sheep in losing him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRO.">
  <li>Indeed a sheep doth very often stray,</li>
  <li data-number="75">And if the shepherd be awhile away.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SPEED.">
  <li>You conclude that my master is a shepherd then, and I a sheep?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRO.">
  <li>I do.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SPEED.">
  <li>Why then my horns are his horns, whether I wake or sleep.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRO.">
  <li>A silly answer, and fitting well a sheep.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SPEED.">
  <li data-number="80">This proves me still a sheep.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRO.">
  <li>True; and thy master a shepherd.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SPEED.">
  <li>Nay, that I can deny by a circumstance.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRO.">
  <li>It shall go hard but I’ll prove it by another.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SPEED.">
  <li>The shepherd seeks the sheep, and not the sheep the shepherd; but I seek my master, and my master seeks not me: therefore I am no sheep.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRO.">
  <li data-number="85">The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd, the shepherd for food follows not the sheep; thou for wages followest thy master, thy master for wages follows not thee: therefore thou art a sheep.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SPEED.">
  <li>Such another proof will make me cry “baa.”</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRO.">
  <li>But dost thou hear? Gav’st thou my letter to Julia?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SPEED.">
  <li>Ay, sir; I (a lost mutton) gave your letter to her (a lac’d mutton), and she (a lac’d mutton) gave me (a lost mutton) nothing for my labor.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRO.">
  <li>Here’s too small a pasture for such store of muttons.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SPEED.">
  <li data-number="90">If the ground be overcharg’d, you were best stick her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRO.">
  <li>Nay, in that you are astray; ’twere best pound you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SPEED.">
  <li>Nay, sir, less than a pound shall serve me for carrying your letter.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRO.">
  <li>You mistake; I mean the pound—a pinfold.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SPEED.">
  <li>From a pound to a pin? Fold it over and over,</li>
  <li data-number="95">’Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to your lover.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRO.">
  <li>But what said she?</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Speed nods, and Proteus looks at him questioningly.
	
		SPEED.
		PRO.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="SPEED.">
  <li>Ay.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRO.">
  <li>Nod-ay—why, that’s “noddy.”</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SPEED.">
  <li>You mistook, sir: I say, she did nod; and you ask me if she did nod, and I say, “Ay.”</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRO.">
  <li data-number="100">And that set together is “noddy.”</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SPEED.">
  <li>Now you have taken the pains to set it together, take it for your pains.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRO.">
  <li>No, no, you shall have it for bearing the letter.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SPEED.">
  <li>Well, I perceive I must be fain to bear with you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRO.">
  <li>Why, sir, how do you bear with me?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SPEED.">
  <li data-number="105">Marry, sir, the letter, very orderly, having nothing but the word “noddy” for my pains.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRO.">
  <li>Beshrew me, but you have a quick wit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SPEED.">
  <li>And yet it cannot overtake your slow purse.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRO.">
  <li>Come, come, open the matter in brief: what said she?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SPEED.">
  <li>Open your purse, that the money and the matter may be both at once deliver’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRO.">
  <li data-number="110">Well, sir, here is for your pains. What said she?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SPEED.">
  <li>Truly, sir, I think you’ll hardly win her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRO.">
  <li>Why? Couldst thou perceive so much from her?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SPEED.">
  <li>Sir, I could perceive nothing at all from her; no, not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter: and being so hard to me that brought your mind, I fear she’ll prove as hard to you in telling your mind. Give her no token but stones, for she’s as hard as steel.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRO.">
  <li>What said she? Nothing?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SPEED.">
  <li data-number="115">No, not so much as “Take this for thy pains.” To testify your bounty, I thank you, you have testern’d me; in requital whereof, henceforth carry your letters yourself: and so, sir, I’ll commend you to my master.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRO.">
  <li>Go, go, be gone, to save your ship from wrack,</li>
  <li>Which cannot perish having thee aboard,</li>
  <li>Being destin’d to a drier death on shore.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">
	Exit Speed.

</li>
  <li>I must go send some better messenger:</li>
  <li data-number="120">I fear my Julia would not deign my lines,</li>

<h3>Scene 2</h3>

<h4>Verona. The garden of Julia’s house.</h4>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Julia and Lucetta.
	
		JUL.
		LUC.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="JUL.">
  <li>But say, Lucetta, now we are alone,</li>
  <li>Wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li>Ay, madam, so you stumble not unheedfully.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JUL.">
  <li>Of all the fair resort of gentlemen</li>
  <li data-number="5">That every day with parle encounter me,</li>
  <li>In thy opinion which is worthiest love?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li>Please you repeat their names, I’ll show my mind</li>
  <li>According to my shallow simple skill.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JUL.">
  <li>What think’st thou of the fair Sir Eglamour?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li data-number="10">As of a knight well-spoken, neat, and fine;</li>
  <li>But were I you, he never should be mine.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JUL.">
  <li>What think’st thou of the rich Mercatio?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li>Well of his wealth; but of himself, so, so.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JUL.">
  <li>What think’st thou of the gentle Proteus?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li data-number="15">Lord, Lord! To see what folly reigns in us!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JUL.">
  <li>How now? What means this passion at his name?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li>Pardon, dear madam, ’tis a passing shame</li>
  <li>That I (unworthy body as I am)</li>
  <li>Should censure thus on lovely gentlemen.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JUL.">
  <li data-number="20">Why not on Proteus, as of all the rest?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li>Then thus: of many good I think him best.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JUL.">
  <li>Your reason?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li>I have no other but a woman’s reason:</li>
  <li>I think him so, because I think him so.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JUL.">
  <li data-number="25">And wouldst thou have me cast my love on him?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li>Ay—if you thought your love not cast away.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JUL.">
  <li>Why, he, of all the rest, hath never mov’d me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li>Yet he, of all the rest, I think best loves ye.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JUL.">
  <li>His little speaking shows his love but small.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li data-number="30">Fire that’s closest kept burns most of all.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JUL.">
  <li>They do not love that do not show their love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li>O, they love least that let men know their love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JUL.">
  <li>I would I knew his mind.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li>Peruse this paper, madam.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JUL.">
  <li data-number="35">“To Julia”—say, from whom?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li>That the contents will show.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JUL.">
  <li>Say, say; who gave it thee?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li>Sir Valentine’s page; and sent, I think, from Proteus.</li>
  <li>He would have given it you, but I, being in the way,</li>
  <li data-number="40">Did in your name receive it; pardon the fault, I pray.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JUL.">
  <li>Now, by my modesty, a goodly broker!</li>
  <li>Dare you presume to harbor wanton lines?</li>
  <li>To whisper and conspire against my youth?</li>
  <li>Now trust me, ’tis an office of great worth,</li>
  <li data-number="45">And you an officer fit for the place.</li>
  <li>There! Take the paper; see it be return’d,</li>
  <li>Or else return no more into my sight.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li>To plead for love deserves more fee than hate.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JUL.">
  <li>Will ye be gone?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">

  <li data-number="50">And yet I would I had o’erlook’d the letter;</li>
  <li>It were a shame to call her back again,</li>

  <li>What ’fool is she, that knows I am a maid,</li>
  <li>And would not force the letter to my view!</li>
  <li data-number="55">Since maids, in modesty, say “no” to that</li>
  <li>Which they would have the profferer construe “ay.”</li>
  <li>Fie, fie, how wayward is this foolish love,</li>
  <li>That (like a testy babe) will scratch the nurse</li>
  <li>And presently, all humbled, kiss the rod!</li>

  <li data-number="105">I’ll kiss each several paper for amends.</li>
  <li>Look, here is writ “kind Julia.” Unkind Julia,</li>

  <li>Poor wounded name: my bosom as a bed</li>
  <li>Shall lodge thee till thy wound be throughly heal’d;</li>
  <li>And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss.</li>

  <li data-number="115">Be calm, good wind, blow not a word away</li>
  <li>Till I have found each letter in the letter,</li>

<h4>Verona. A room in Antonio’s house.</h4>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Antonio and Panthino.

</div>

<ol data-speaker="ANT.">
  <li>Tell me, Panthino, what sad talk was that</li>
  <li>Wherewith my brother held you in the cloister?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li>’Twas of his nephew Proteus, your son.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANT.">
  <li>Why, what of him?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li data-offset="4">He wond’red that your lordship</li>
  <li data-number="5">Would suffer him to spend his youth at home,</li>
  <li>While other men, of slender reputation,</li>
  <li>Put forth their sons to seek preferment out:</li>
  <li>Some to the wars, to try their fortune there;</li>
  <li>Some to discover islands far away;</li>
  <li data-number="10">Some to the studious universities.</li>
  <li>For any or for all these exercises</li>
  <li>He said that Proteus, your son, was meet;</li>
  <li>And did request me to importune you</li>
  <li>To let him spend his time no more at home,</li>
  <li data-number="15">Which would be great impeachment to his age,</li>
  <li>In having known no travel in his youth.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANT.">
  <li>Nor need’st thou much importune me to that</li>
  <li>Whereon this month I have been hammering.</li>
  <li>I have consider’d well his loss of time,</li>
  <li data-number="20">And how he cannot be a perfect man,</li>
  <li>Not being tried and tutor’d in the world:</li>
  <li>Experience is by industry achiev’d,</li>
  <li>And perfected by the swift course of time.</li>
  <li>Then tell me, whither were I best to send him?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li data-number="25">I think your lordship is not ignorant</li>
  <li>How his companion, youthful Valentine,</li>
  <li>Attends the Emperor in his royal court.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANT.">
  <li>I know it well.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li>’Twere good, I think, your lordship sent him thither:</li>
  <li data-number="30">There shall he practice tilts and tournaments,</li>
  <li>Hear sweet discourse, converse with noblemen,</li>
  <li>And be in eye of every exercise</li>
  <li>Worthy his youth and nobleness of birth.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANT.">
  <li>I like thy counsel; well hast thou advis’d;</li>
  <li data-number="35">And that thou mayst perceive how well I like it,</li>
  <li>The execution of it shall make known:</li>
  <li>Even with the speediest expedition</li>
  <li>I will dispatch him to the Emperor’s court.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li>Tomorrow, may it please you, Don Alphonso</li>

  <li>How now? What letter are you reading there?</li>

<ol data-speaker="PRO.">
  <li>May’t please your lordship, ’tis a word or two</li>
  <li>Of commendations sent from Valentine,</li>
  <li>Deliver’d by a friend that came from him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANT.">
  <li data-number="55">Lend me the letter; let me see what news.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRO.">
  <li>There is no news, my lord, but that he writes</li>
  <li>How happily he lives, how well-belov’d</li>
  <li>And daily graced by the Emperor;</li>
  <li>Wishing me with him, partner of his fortune.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANT.">
  <li data-number="60">And how stand you affected to his wish?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRO.">
  <li>As one relying on your lordship’s will,</li>
  <li>And not depending on his friendly wish.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANT.">
  <li>My will is something sorted with his wish:</li>
  <li>Muse not that I thus suddenly proceed;</li>
  <li data-number="65">For what I will, I will, and there an end.</li>
  <li>I am resolv’d that thou shalt spend some time</li>
  <li>With Valentinus in the Emperor’s court;</li>
  <li>What maintenance he from his friends receives,</li>
  <li>Like exhibition thou shalt have from me.</li>
  <li data-number="70">Tomorrow be in readiness to go—</li>
  <li>Excuse it not, for I am peremptory.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRO.">
  <li>My lord I cannot be so soon provided:</li>
  <li>Please you deliberate a day or two.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANT.">
  <li>Look what thou want’st shall be sent after thee.</li>
  <li data-number="75">No more of stay: tomorrow thou must go.</li>
  <li>Come on, Panthino; you shall be employ’d</li>
  <li>To hasten on his expedition.</li>

  <li>Thus have I shunn’d the fire for fear of burning,</li>

  <li data-number="80">I fear’d to show my father Julia’s letter,</li>
  <li>Lest he should take exceptions to my love,</li>

  <li>O, how this spring of love resembleth</li>

</li>
  <li data-number="5" data-offset="4">Madam Silvia! Madam Silvia!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VAL.">
  <li>How now, sirrah?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SPEED.">
  <li>She is not within hearing, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VAL.">
  <li>Why, sir, who bade you call her?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SPEED.">
  <li>Your worship, sir, or else I mistook.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VAL.">
  <li data-number="10">Well—You’ll still be too forward.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SPEED.">
  <li>And yet I was last chidden for being too slow.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VAL.">
  <li>Go to, sir; tell me, do you know Madam Silvia?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SPEED.">
  <li>She that your worship loves?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VAL.">
  <li>Why, how know you that I am in love?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SPEED.">
  <li data-number="15">Marry, by these special marks: first, you have learn’d, like Sir Proteus, to wreathe your arms, like a malcontent; to relish a love-song, like a robin-redbreast; to walk alone, like one that had the pestilence; to sigh, like a schoolboy that had lost his A B C; to weep, like a young wench that had buried her grandam; to fast, like one that takes diet; to watch, like one that fears robbing; to speak puling, like a beggar at <date when=" — 11-01" type="holiday" subtype="Christian">Hallowmas</date>. You were wont, when you laugh’d, to crow like a cock; when you walk’d, to walk like one of the lions; when you fasted, it was presently after dinner; when you look’d sadly, it was for want of money: and now you are metamorphis’d with a mistress, that when I look on you, I can hardly think you my master.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VAL.">
  <li>Are all these things perceiv’d in me?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SPEED.">
  <li>They are all perceiv’d without ye.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VAL.">
  <li>Without me? They cannot.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SPEED.">
  <li>Without you? Nay, that’s certain; for without you were so simple, none else would: but you are so without these follies, that these follies are within you, and shine through you like the water in an urinal, that not an eye that sees you but is a physician to comment on your malady.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VAL.">
  <li data-number="20">But tell me: dost thou know my lady Silvia?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SPEED.">
  <li>She that you gaze on so as she sits at supper?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VAL.">
  <li>Hast thou observ’d that? Even she I mean.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SPEED.">
  <li>Why, sir, I know her not.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VAL.">
  <li>Dost thou know her by my gazing on her, and yet know’st her not?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SPEED.">
  <li data-number="25">Is she not hard-favor’d, sir?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VAL.">
  <li>Not so fair, boy, as well-favor’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SPEED.">
  <li>Sir, I know that well enough.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VAL.">
  <li>What dost thou know?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SPEED.">
  <li>That she is not so fair as (of you) well favor’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VAL.">
  <li data-number="30">I mean that her beauty is exquisite, but her favor infinite.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SPEED.">
  <li>That’s because the one is painted, and the other out of all count.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VAL.">
  <li>How painted? And how out of count?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SPEED.">
  <li>Marry, sir, so painted to make her fair, that no man counts of her beauty.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VAL.">
  <li>How esteem’st thou me? I account of her beauty.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SPEED.">
  <li data-number="35">You never saw her since she was deform’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VAL.">
  <li>How long hath she been deform’d?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SPEED.">
  <li>Ever since you lov’d her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VAL.">
  <li>I have lov’d her ever since I saw her, and still I see her beautiful.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SPEED.">
  <li>If you love her, you cannot see her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VAL.">
  <li data-number="40">Why?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SPEED.">
  <li>Because Love is blind. O that you had mine eyes, or your own eyes had the lights they were wont to have when you chid at Sir Proteus for going ungarter’d!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VAL.">
  <li>What should I see then?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SPEED.">
  <li>Your own present folly, and her passing deformity: for he, being in love, could not see to garter his hose; and you, being in love, cannot see to put on your hose.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VAL.">
  <li>Belike, boy, then you are in love—for last morning you could not see to wipe my shoes.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SPEED.">
  <li data-number="45">True, sir; I was in love with my bed. I thank you, you swing’d me for my love, which makes me the bolder to chide you for yours.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VAL.">
  <li>In conclusion, I stand affected to her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SPEED.">
  <li>I would you were set, so your affection would cease.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VAL.">
  <li>Last night she enjoin’d me to write some lines to one she loves.</li>

<ol data-speaker="VAL.">
  <li data-number="50">I have.</li>
</ol>

  <li>Now trust me, madam, it came hardly off;</li>

  <li>Perchance you think too much of so much pains?</li>

  <li>A pretty period! Well—I guess the sequel;</li>

  <li>Nay, ’twill be this hour ere I have done weeping; all the kind of the Launces have this very fault. I have receiv’d my proportion, like the prodigious son, and am going with Sir Proteus to the Imperial’s court. I think Crab my dog be the sourest-natur’d dog that lives: my mother weeping, my father wailing, my sister crying, our maid howling, our cat wringing her hands, and all our house in a great perplexity, yet did not this cruel-hearted cur shed one tear. He is a stone, a very pebble stone, and has no more pity in him than a dog. A Jew would have wept to have seen our parting; why, my grandam, having no eyes, look you, wept herself blind at my parting. Nay, I’ll show you the manner of it. This shoe is my father; no, this left shoe is my father; no, no, this left shoe is my mother; nay, that cannot be so neither; yes, it is so, it is so—it hath the worser sole. This shoe, with the hole in it, is my mother, and this my father—a vengeance on’t! There ’tis. Now, sir, this staff is my sister, for, look you, she is as white as a lily and as small as a wand. This hat is Nan, our maid. I am the dog—no, the dog is himself, and I am the dog—O! The dog is me, and I am myself; ay, so, so. Now come I to my father: “Father, your blessing.” Now should not the shoe speak a word for weeping; now should I kiss my father; well, he weeps on. Now come I to my mother. O that she could speak now like a wood woman! Well, I kiss her; why, there ’tis; here’s my mother’s breath up and down. Now come I to my sister; mark the moan she makes. Now the dog all this while sheds not a tear, nor speaks a word; but see how I lay the dust with my tears.</li>

  <li>Love bade me swear, and Love bids me forswear.</li>
  <li>O sweet-suggesting Love, if thou hast sinn’d,</li>

  <li>At first I did adore a twinkling star,</li>

  <li>Counsel, Lucetta; gentle girl, assist me;</li>

  <li>Who art the table wherein all my thoughts</li>

  <li data-number="5">To lesson me and tell me some good mean</li>
  <li>How with my honor I may undertake</li>
  <li>A journey to my loving Proteus.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li>Alas, the way is wearisome and long.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JUL.">
  <li>A true-devoted pilgrim is not weary</li>
  <li data-number="10">To measure kingdoms with his feeble steps;</li>
  <li>Much less shall she that hath Love’s wings to fly,</li>
  <li>And when the flight is made to one so dear,</li>
  <li>Of such divine perfection, as Sir Proteus.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li>Better forbear till Proteus make return.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JUL.">
  <li data-number="15">O, know’st thou not his looks are my soul’s food?</li>
  <li>Pity the dearth that I have pined in,</li>
  <li>By longing for that food so long a time.</li>
  <li>Didst thou but know the inly touch of love,</li>
  <li>Thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow</li>
  <li data-number="20">As seek to quench the fire of love with words.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li>I do not seek to quench your love’s hot fire,</li>
  <li>But qualify the fire’s extreme rage,</li>
  <li>Lest it should burn above the bounds of reason.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JUL.">
  <li>The more thou dam’st it up, the more it burns:</li>
  <li data-number="25">The current that with gentle murmur glides,</li>
  <li>Thou know’st, being stopp’d, impatiently doth rage;</li>
  <li>But when his fair course is not hindered,</li>
  <li>He makes sweet music with th’ enamell’d stones,</li>
  <li>Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge</li>
  <li data-number="30">He overtaketh in his pilgrimage;</li>
  <li>And so by many winding nooks he strays</li>
  <li>With willing sport to the wild ocean.</li>
  <li>Then let me go, and hinder not my course:</li>
  <li>I’ll be as patient as a gentle stream,</li>
  <li data-number="35">And make a pastime of each weary step,</li>
  <li>Till the last step have brought me to my love,</li>
  <li>And there I’ll rest, as after much turmoil</li>
  <li>A blessed soul doth in Elysium.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li>But in what habit will you go along?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JUL.">
  <li data-number="40">Not like a woman, for I would prevent</li>
  <li>The loose encounters of lascivious men:</li>
  <li>Gentle Lucetta, fit me with such weeds</li>
  <li>As may beseem some well-reputed page.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li>Why then your ladyship must cut your hair.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JUL.">
  <li data-number="45">No, girl, I’ll knit it up in silken strings,</li>
  <li>With twenty odd-conceited true-love knots:</li>
  <li>To be fantastic may become a youth</li>
  <li>Of greater time than I shall show to be.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li>What fashion, madam, shall I make your breeches?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JUL.">
  <li data-number="50">That fits as well as “Tell me, good my lord,</li>
  <li>What compass will you wear your farthingale?”</li>
  <li>Why, ev’n what fashion thou best likes, Lucetta.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li>You must needs have them with a codpiece, madam.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JUL.">
  <li>Out, out, Lucetta, that will be ill-favor’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li data-number="55">A round hose, madam, now’s not worth a pin,</li>
  <li>Unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JUL.">
  <li>Lucetta, as thou lov’st me, let me have</li>
  <li>What thou think’st meet, and is most mannerly.</li>
  <li>But tell me, wench, how will the world repute me</li>
  <li data-number="60">For undertaking so unstaid a journey?</li>
  <li>I fear me it will make me scandaliz’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li>If you think so, then stay at home and go not.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JUL.">
  <li>Nay, that I will not.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li>Then never dream on infamy, but go.</li>
  <li data-number="65">If Proteus like your journey when you come,</li>
  <li>No matter who’s displeas’d when you are gone:</li>
  <li>I fear me he will scarce be pleas’d withal.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JUL.">
  <li>That is the least, Lucetta, of my fear:</li>
  <li>A thousand oaths, an ocean of his tears,</li>
  <li data-number="70">And instances of infinite of love,</li>
  <li>Warrant me welcome to my Proteus.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li>All these are servants to deceitful men.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JUL.">
  <li>Base men, that use them to so base effect!</li>
  <li>But truer stars did govern Proteus’ birth:</li>
  <li data-number="75">His words are bonds, his oaths are oracles,</li>
  <li>His love sincere, his thoughts immaculate,</li>
  <li>His tears pure messengers sent from his heart,</li>
  <li>His heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li>Pray heav’n he prove so when you come to him!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JUL.">
  <li data-number="80">Now, as thou lov’st me, do him not that wrong,</li>
  <li>To bear a hard opinion of his truth:</li>
  <li>Only deserve my love by loving him,</li>
  <li>And presently go with me to my chamber,</li>
  <li>To take a note of what I stand in need of,</li>
  <li data-number="85">To furnish me upon my longing journey.</li>
  <li>All that is mine I leave at thy dispose,</li>
  <li>My goods, my lands, my reputation;</li>
  <li>Only, in lieu thereof, dispatch me hence.</li>
  <li>Come; answer not; but to it presently,</li>

		THU.
	
</li>
  <li>Now tell me, Proteus, what’s your will with me?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRO.">
  <li>My gracious lord, that which I would discover</li>
  <li data-number="5">The law of friendship bids me to conceal,</li>
  <li>But when I call to mind your gracious favors</li>
  <li>Done to me (undeserving as I am),</li>
  <li>My duty pricks me on to utter that</li>
  <li>Which else no worldly good should draw from me.</li>
  <li data-number="10">Know, worthy prince, Sir Valentine, my friend,</li>
  <li>This night intends to steal away your daughter;</li>
  <li>Myself am one made privy to the plot.</li>
  <li>I know you have determin’d to bestow her</li>
  <li>On Thurio, whom your gentle daughter hates,</li>
  <li data-number="15">And should she thus be stol’n away from you,</li>
  <li>It would be much vexation to your age.</li>
  <li>Thus, for my duty’s sake, I rather chose</li>
  <li>To cross my friend in his intended drift,</li>
  <li>Than, by concealing it, heap on your head</li>
  <li data-number="20">A pack of sorrows which would press you down,</li>
  <li>Being unprevented, to your timeless grave.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li>Proteus, I thank thee for thine honest care,</li>
  <li>Which to requite, command me while I live.</li>
  <li>This love of theirs myself have often seen,</li>
  <li data-number="25">Haply when they have judg’d me fast asleep,</li>
  <li>And oftentimes have purpos’d to forbid</li>
  <li>Sir Valentine her company and my court;</li>
  <li>But fearing lest my jealous aim might err,</li>
  <li>And so, unworthily, disgrace the man</li>
  <li data-number="30">(A rashness that I ever yet have shunn’d),</li>
  <li>I gave him gentle looks, thereby to find</li>
  <li>That which thyself hast now disclos’d to me.</li>
  <li>And that thou mayst perceive my fear of this,</li>
  <li>Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested,</li>
  <li data-number="35">I nightly lodge her in an upper tow’r,</li>
  <li>The key whereof myself have ever kept;</li>
  <li>And thence she cannot be convey’d away.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRO.">
  <li>Know, noble lord, they have devis’d a mean</li>
  <li>How he her chamber-window will ascend,</li>

  <li>For which the youthful lover now is gone,</li>
  <li>And this way comes he with it presently,</li>
  <li>Where (if it please you) you may intercept him.</li>
  <li>But, good my lord, do it so cunningly</li>
  <li data-number="45">That my discovery be not aimed at:</li>
  <li>For love of you, not hate unto my friend,</li>
  <li>Hath made me publisher of this pretense.</li>

<ol data-speaker="VAL.">
  <li>Please it your Grace, there is a messenger</li>
  <li>That stays to bear my letters to my friends,</li>
  <li>And I am going to deliver them.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li data-number="55">Be they of much import?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VAL.">
  <li>The tenure of them doth but signify</li>
  <li>My health and happy being at your court.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li>Nay then no matter; stay with me a while;</li>
  <li>I am to break with thee of some affairs</li>
  <li data-number="60">That touch me near, wherein thou must be secret.</li>
  <li>’Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought</li>
  <li>To match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VAL.">
  <li>I know it well, my lord, and sure the match</li>
  <li>Were rich and honorable; besides, the gentleman</li>
  <li data-number="65">Is full of virtue, bounty, worth, and qualities</li>
  <li>Beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter.</li>
  <li>Cannot your Grace win her to fancy him?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li>No, trust me, she is peevish, sullen, froward,</li>
  <li>Proud, disobedient, stubborn, lacking duty,</li>
  <li data-number="70">Neither regarding that she is my child,</li>
  <li>Nor fearing me as if I were her father;</li>
  <li>And may I say to thee, this pride of hers</li>
  <li>(Upon advice) hath drawn my love from her,</li>
  <li>And where I thought the remnant of mine age</li>
  <li data-number="75">Should have been cherish’d by her child-like duty,</li>
  <li>I now am full resolv’d to take a wife,</li>
  <li>And turn her out to who will take her in:</li>
  <li>Then let her beauty be her wedding-dow’r,</li>
  <li>For me and my possessions she esteems not.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VAL.">
  <li data-number="80">What would your Grace have me to do in this?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li>There is a lady in Milano here</li>
  <li>Whom I affect; but she is nice and coy,</li>
  <li>And nought esteems my aged eloquence.</li>
  <li>Now therefore would I have thee to my tutor</li>
  <li data-number="85">(For long agone I have forgot to court;</li>
  <li>Besides, the fashion of the time is chang’d)</li>
  <li>How and which way I may bestow myself</li>
  <li>To be regarded in her sun-bright eye.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VAL.">
  <li>Win her with gifts, if she respect not words:</li>
  <li data-number="90">Dumb jewels often in their silent kind</li>
  <li>More than quick words do move a woman’s mind.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li>But she did scorn a present that I sent her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VAL.">
  <li>A woman sometime scorns what best contents her.</li>
  <li>Send her another; never give her o’er,</li>
  <li data-number="95">For scorn at first makes after-love the more.</li>
  <li>If she do frown, ’tis not in hate of you,</li>
  <li>But rather to beget more love in you.</li>
  <li>If she do chide, ’tis not to have you gone,</li>
  <li>For why, the fools are mad, if left alone.</li>
  <li data-number="100">Take no repulse, what ever she doth say;</li>
  <li>For “get you gone,” she doth not mean “away!”</li>
  <li>Flatter and praise, commend, extol their graces;</li>
  <li>Though ne’er so black, say they have angels’ faces.</li>
  <li>That man that hath a tongue, I say is no man,</li>
  <li data-number="105">If with his tongue he cannot win a woman.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li>But she I mean is promis’d by her friends</li>
  <li>Unto a youthful gentleman of worth,</li>
  <li>And kept severely from resort of men,</li>
  <li>That no man hath access by day to her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VAL.">
  <li data-number="110">Why then I would resort to her by night.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li>Ay, but the doors be lock’d, and keys kept safe,</li>
  <li>That no man hath recourse to her by night.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VAL.">
  <li>What lets but one may enter at her window?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li>Her chamber is aloft, far from the ground,</li>
  <li data-number="115">And built so shelving that one cannot climb it</li>
  <li>Without apparent hazard of his life.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VAL.">
  <li>Why then a ladder, quaintly made of cords,</li>
  <li>To cast up, with a pair of anchoring hooks,</li>
  <li>Would serve to scale another Hero’s tow’r,</li>
  <li data-number="120">So bold Leander would adventure it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li>Now as thou art a gentleman of blood,</li>
  <li>Advise me where I may have such a ladder.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VAL.">
  <li>When would you use it? Pray, sir, tell me that.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li>This very night; for Love is like a child,</li>
  <li data-number="125">That longs for every thing that he can come by.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VAL.">
  <li>By seven a’ clock I’ll get you such a ladder.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li>But hark thee: I will go to her alone.</li>
  <li>How shall I best convey the ladder thither?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VAL.">
  <li>It will be light, my lord, that you may bear it</li>
  <li data-number="130">Under a cloak that is of any length.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li>A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?</li>

  <li>Ay, my good lord.</li>

  <li data-offset="4">Then let me see thy cloak—</li>
  <li>I’ll get me one of such another length.</li>

  <li>She did, my lord, when Valentine was here.</li>

  <li>What might we do to make the girl forget</li>
  <li data-number="30">The love of Valentine, and love Sir Thurio?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRO.">
  <li>The best way is to slander Valentine</li>

<ol data-speaker="PRO.">
  <li data-number="35">Ay, if his enemy deliver it;</li>
  <li>Therefore it must with circumstance be spoken</li>

  <li>And that, my lord, I shall be loath to do:</li>
  <li data-number="40">’Tis an ill office for a gentleman,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li>Where your good word cannot advantage him,</li>
  <li>Your slander never can endamage him;</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRO.">
  <li>You have prevail’d, my lord; if I can do it</li>
  <li>By aught that I can speak in his dispraise,</li>
  <li>She shall not long continue love to him.</li>
  <li>But say this weed her love from Valentine,</li>
  <li data-number="50">It follows not that she will love Sir Thurio.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="THU.">
  <li>Therefore, as you unwind her love from him,</li>
  <li>Lest it should ravel and be good to none,</li>
  <li>You must provide to bottom it on me;</li>
  <li>Which must be done by praising me as much</li>
  <li data-number="55">As you in worth dispraise Sir Valentine.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li>And, Proteus, we dare trust you in this kind,</li>
  <li>Because we know (on Valentine’s report)</li>
  <li>You are already Love’s firm votary,</li>
  <li>And cannot soon revolt and change your mind.</li>
  <li data-number="60">Upon this warrant shall you have access</li>
  <li>Where you with Silvia may confer at large—</li>
  <li>For she is lumpish, heavy, melancholy,</li>
  <li>And (for your friend’s sake) will be glad of you—</li>
  <li>Where you may temper her by your persuasion</li>
  <li data-number="65">To hate young Valentine and love my friend.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRO.">
  <li>As much as I can do, I will effect.</li>
  <li>But you, Sir Thurio, are not sharp enough;</li>
  <li>You must lay lime to tangle her desires</li>
  <li>By wailful sonnets, whose composed rhymes</li>
  <li data-number="70">Should be full-fraught with serviceable vows.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li>Ay, much is the force of heaven-bred poesy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRO.">
  <li>Say that upon the altar of her beauty</li>
  <li>You sacrifice your tears, your sighs, your heart;</li>
  <li>Write till your ink be dry, and with your tears</li>
  <li data-number="75">Moist it again, and frame some feeling line</li>
  <li>That may discover such integrity:</li>
  <li>For Orpheus’ lute was strung with poets’ sinews,</li>
  <li>Whose golden touch could soften steel and stones,</li>
  <li>Make tigers tame, and huge leviathans</li>
  <li data-number="80">Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands.</li>
  <li>After your dire-lamenting elegies,</li>
  <li>Visit by night your lady’s chamber-window</li>
  <li>With some sweet consort; to their instruments</li>
  <li>Tune a deploring dump—the night’s dead silence</li>
  <li data-number="85">Will well become such sweet-complaining grievance.</li>
  <li>This, or else nothing, will inherit her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li>This discipline shows thou hast been in love.</li>

<ol data-speaker="LAUNCE.">
  <li>When a man’s servant shall play the cur with him, look you, it goes hard: one that I brought up of a puppy; one that I sav’d from drowning, when three or four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it. I have taught him, even as one would say precisely, “Thus I would teach a dog.” I was sent to deliver him as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master; and I came no sooner into the dining-chamber but he steps me to her trencher and steals her capon’s leg. O, ’tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself in all companies! I would have (as one should say) one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed, to be, as it were, a dog at all things. If I had not had more wit than he, to take a fault upon me that he did, I think verily he had been hang’d for’t; sure as I live he had suffer’d for’t. You shall judge: he thrusts me himself into the company of three or four gentleman-like dogs, under the Duke’s table. He had not been there (bless the mark!) a pissing-while, but all the chamber smelt him. “Out with the dog,” says one. “What cur is that?” says another. “Whip him out,” says the third. “Hang him up,” says the Duke. I, having been acquainted with the smell before, knew it was Crab, and goes me to the fellow that whips the dogs: “Friend,” quoth I, “you mean to whip the dog?” “Ay, marry, do I,” quoth he. “You do him the more wrong,” quoth I, “’twas I did the thing you wot of.” He makes me no more ado, but whips me out of the chamber. How many masters would do this for his servant? Nay, I’ll be sworn, I have sat in the stocks for puddings he hath stol’n, otherwise he had been executed; I have stood on the pillory for geese he hath kill’d, otherwise he had suffer’d for’t. Thou think’st not of this now. Nay, I remember the trick you serv’d me, when I took my leave of Madam Silvia. Did not I bid thee still mark me, and do as I do? When didst thou see me heave up my leg and make water against a gentlewoman’s farthingale? Didst thou ever see me do such a trick?</li>

  <li>Which I so lively acted with my tears</li>
  <li data-number="125">That my poor mistress, moved therewithal,</li>

  <li>O heaven be judge how I love Valentine,</li>

  <li>Thou common friend, that’s without faith or love,</li>

  <li>I have one friend alive; thou wouldst disprove me.</li>
  <li>Who should be trusted, when one’s right hand</li>

  <li>I am sorry I must never trust thee more,</li>
  <li data-number="70">But count the world a stranger for thy sake.</li>
  <li>The private wound is deepest: O time most accurst!</li>

  <li>My shame and guilt confounds me.</li>

  <li>Now, by the honor of my ancestry,</li>
