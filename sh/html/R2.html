<ol data-speaker="K. RICH.">
  <li>Old John of Gaunt, time-honored Lancaster,</li>
  <li>Hast thou, according to thy oath and band,</li>
  <li>Brought hither Henry Herford thy bold son,</li>
  <li>Here to make good the boist’rous late appeal,</li>
  <li data-number="5">Which then our leisure would not let us hear,</li>
  <li>Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GAUNT.">
  <li>I have, my liege.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. RICH.">
  <li>Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him,</li>
  <li>If he appeal the Duke on ancient malice,</li>
  <li data-number="10">Or worthily, as a good subject should,</li>
  <li>On some known ground of treachery in him?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GAUNT.">
  <li>As near as I could sift him on that argument,</li>
  <li>On some apparent danger seen in him</li>
  <li>Aim’d at your Highness, no inveterate malice.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. RICH.">
  <li data-number="15">Then call them to our presence; face to face,</li>
  <li>And frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hear</li>
  <li>The accuser and the accused freely speak.</li>
  <li>High-stomach’d are they both and full of ire,</li>
  <li>In rage, deaf as the sea, hasty as fire.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Bullingbrook and Mowbray with Attendants.

</div>

<ol data-speaker="BULL.">
  <li data-number="20">Many years of happy days befall</li>
  <li>My gracious sovereign, my most loving liege!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOW.">
  <li>Each day still better other’s happiness,</li>
  <li>Until the heavens, envying earth’s good hap,</li>
  <li>Add an immortal title to your crown!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. RICH.">
  <li data-number="25">We thank you both, yet one but flatters us,</li>
  <li>As well appeareth by the cause you come:</li>
  <li>Namely, to appeal each other of high treason.</li>
  <li>Cousin of Herford, what dost thou object</li>
  <li>Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BULL.">
  <li data-number="30">First, heaven be the record to my speech,</li>
  <li>In the devotion of a subject’s love,</li>
  <li>Tend’ring the precious safety of my prince,</li>
  <li>And free from other misbegotten hate,</li>
  <li>Come I appellant to this princely presence.</li>
  <li data-number="35">Now, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee,</li>
  <li>And mark my greeting well; for what I speak</li>
  <li>My body shall make good upon this earth,</li>
  <li>Or my divine soul answer it in heaven.</li>
  <li>Thou art a traitor and a miscreant,</li>
  <li data-number="40">Too good to be so, and too bad to live,</li>
  <li>Since the more fair and crystal is the sky,</li>
  <li>The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly.</li>
  <li>Once more, the more to aggravate the note,</li>
  <li>With a foul traitor’s name stuff I thy throat,</li>
  <li data-number="45">And wish (so please my sovereign) ere I move,</li>
  <li>What my tongue speaks, my right drawn sword may prove.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOW.">
  <li>Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal.</li>
  <li>’Tis not the trial of a woman’s war,</li>
  <li>The bitter clamor of two eager tongues,</li>
  <li data-number="50">Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain;</li>
  <li>The blood is hot that must be cool’d for this.</li>
  <li>Yet can I not of such tame patience boast</li>
  <li>As to be hush’d and nought at all to say.</li>
  <li>First, the fair reverence of your Highness curbs me</li>
  <li data-number="55">From giving reins and spurs to my free speech,</li>
  <li>Which else would post until it had return’d</li>
  <li>These terms of treason doubled down his throat.</li>
  <li>Setting aside his high blood’s royalty,</li>
  <li>And let him be no kinsman to my liege,</li>
  <li data-number="60">I do defy him, and I spit at him,</li>
  <li>Call him a slanderous coward, and a villain,</li>
  <li>Which to maintain I would allow him odds</li>
  <li>And meet him, were I tied to run afoot</li>
  <li>Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps,</li>
  <li data-number="65">Or any other ground inhabitable</li>
  <li>Where ever Englishman durst set his foot.</li>
  <li>Mean time, let this defend my loyalty:</li>
  <li>By all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BULL.">
  <li>Pale trembling coward, there I throw my gage,</li>
  <li data-number="70">Disclaiming here the kindred of the King,</li>
  <li>And lay aside my high blood’s royalty,</li>
  <li>Which fear, not reverence, makes thee to except.</li>
  <li>If guilty dread have left thee so much strength</li>
  <li>As to take up mine honor’s pawn, then stoop.</li>
  <li data-number="75">By that, and all the rites of knighthood else,</li>
  <li>Will I make good against thee, arm to arm,</li>
  <li>What I have spoke, or thou canst worse devise.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOW.">
  <li>I take it up, and by that sword I swear</li>
  <li>Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder,</li>
  <li data-number="80">I’ll answer thee in any fair degree</li>
  <li>Or chivalrous design of knightly trial;</li>
  <li>And when I mount, alive may I not light,</li>
  <li>If I be traitor or unjustly fight!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. RICH.">
  <li>What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray’s charge?</li>
  <li data-number="85">It must be great that can inherit us</li>
  <li>So much as of a thought of ill in him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BULL.">
  <li>Look what I speak, my life shall prove it true:</li>
  <li>That Mowbray hath receiv’d eight thousand nobles</li>
  <li>In name of lendings for your Highness’ soldiers,</li>
  <li data-number="90">The which he hath detain’d for lewd employments,</li>
  <li>Like a false traitor and injurious villain;</li>
  <li>Besides I say, and will in battle prove,</li>
  <li>Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge</li>
  <li>That ever was surveyed by English eye,</li>
  <li data-number="95">That all the treasons for these eighteen years,</li>
  <li>Complotted and contrived in this land,</li>
  <li>Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring.</li>
  <li>Further I say, and further will maintain</li>
  <li>Upon his bad life to make all this good,</li>
  <li data-number="100">That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester’s death,</li>
  <li>Suggest his soon-believing adversaries,</li>
  <li>And consequently, like a traitor coward,</li>
  <li>Sluic’d out his innocent soul through streams of blood,</li>
  <li>Which blood, like sacrificing Abel’s, cries,</li>
  <li data-number="105">Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth,</li>
  <li>To me for justice and rough chastisement;</li>
  <li>And, by the glorious worth of my descent,</li>
  <li>This arm shall do it, or this life be spent.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. RICH.">
  <li>How high a pitch his resolution soars!</li>
  <li data-number="110">Thomas of Norfolk, what say’st thou to this?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOW.">
  <li>O, let my sovereign turn away his face,</li>
  <li>And bid his ears a little while be deaf,</li>
  <li>Till I have told this slander of his blood</li>
  <li>How God and good men hate so foul a liar.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. RICH.">
  <li data-number="115">Mowbray, impartial are our eyes and ears.</li>
  <li>Were he my brother, nay, my kingdom’s heir,</li>
  <li>As he is but my father’s brother’s son,</li>
  <li>Now by my sceptre’s awe I make a vow,</li>
  <li>Such neighbor nearness to our sacred blood</li>
  <li data-number="120">Should nothing privilege him nor partialize</li>
  <li>The unstooping firmness of my upright soul.</li>
  <li>He is our subject, Mowbray; so art thou.</li>
  <li>Free speech and fearless I to thee allow.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOW.">
  <li>Then, Bullingbrook, as low as to thy heart</li>
  <li data-number="125">Through the false passage of thy throat thou liest.</li>
  <li>Three parts of that receipt I had for Callice</li>
  <li>Disburs’d I duly to his Highness’ soldiers;</li>
  <li>The other part reserv’d I by consent,</li>
  <li>For that my sovereign liege was in my debt,</li>
  <li data-number="130">Upon remainder of a dear account,</li>
  <li>Since last I went to France to fetch his queen.</li>
  <li>Now swallow down that lie. For Gloucester’s death,</li>
  <li>I slew him not, but to my own disgrace</li>
  <li>Neglected my sworn duty in that case.</li>
  <li data-number="135">For you, my noble Lord of Lancaster,</li>
  <li>The honorable father to my foe,</li>
  <li>Once did I lay an ambush for your life,</li>
  <li>A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul;</li>
  <li>But ere I last receiv’d the sacrament</li>
  <li data-number="140">I did confess it, and exactly begg’d</li>
  <li>Your Grace’s pardon, and I hope I had it.</li>
  <li>This is my fault. As for the rest appeal’d,</li>
  <li>It issues from the rancor of a villain,</li>
  <li>A recreant and most degenerate traitor,</li>
  <li data-number="145">Which in myself I boldly will defend,</li>
  <li>And interchangeably hurl down my gage</li>
  <li>Upon this overweening traitor’s foot,</li>
  <li>To prove myself a loyal gentleman</li>
  <li>Even in the best blood chamber’d in his bosom,</li>
  <li data-number="150">In haste whereof, most heartily I pray</li>
  <li>Your Highness to assign our trial day.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. RICH.">
  <li>Wrath-kindled gentlemen, be rul’d by me,</li>
  <li>Let’s purge this choler without letting blood.</li>
  <li>This we prescribe, though no physician;</li>
  <li data-number="155">Deep malice makes too deep incision.</li>
  <li>Forget, forgive, conclude and be agreed,</li>
  <li>Our doctors say this is no month to bleed.</li>
  <li>Good uncle, let this end where it begun;</li>
  <li>We’ll calm the Duke of Norfolk, you your son.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GAUNT.">
  <li data-number="160">To be a make-peace shall become my age.</li>
  <li>Throw down, my son, the Duke of Norfolk’s gage.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. RICH.">
  <li>And, Norfolk, throw down his.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GAUNT.">
  <li data-offset="7">When, Harry? When?</li>
  <li>Obedience bids I should not bid again.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. RICH.">
  <li>Norfolk, throw down, we bid, there is no boot.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOW.">
  <li data-number="165">Myself I throw, dread sovereign, at thy foot,</li>
  <li>My life thou shalt command, but not my shame:</li>
  <li>The one my duty owes, but my fair name,</li>
  <li>Despite of death that lives upon my grave,</li>
  <li>To dark dishonor’s use thou shalt not have.</li>
  <li data-number="170">I am disgrac’d, impeach’d, and baffled here,</li>
  <li>Pierc’d to the soul with slander’s venom’d spear,</li>
  <li>The which no balm can cure but his heart-blood</li>
  <li>Which breath’d this poison.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. RICH.">
  <li data-offset="5">Rage must be withstood,</li>
  <li>Give me his gage. Lions make leopards tame.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOW.">
  <li data-number="175">Yea, but not change his spots. Take but my shame,</li>
  <li>And I resign my gage. My dear dear lord,</li>
  <li>The purest treasure mortal times afford</li>
  <li>Is spotless reputation; that away,</li>
  <li>Men are but gilded loam or painted clay.</li>
  <li data-number="180">A jewel in a ten-times-barr’d-up chest</li>
  <li>Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast.</li>
  <li>Mine honor is my life, both grow in one,</li>
  <li>Take honor from me, and my life is done.</li>
  <li>Then, dear my liege, mine honor let me try;</li>
  <li data-number="185">In that I live, and for that will I die.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. RICH.">
  <li>Cousin, throw up your gage, do you begin.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BULL.">
  <li>O, God defend my soul from such deep sin!</li>
  <li>Shall I seem crestfallen in my father’s sight?</li>
  <li>Or with pale beggar-fear impeach my height</li>
  <li data-number="190">Before this outdar’d dastard? Ere my tongue</li>
  <li>Shall wound my honor with such feeble wrong,</li>
  <li>Or sound so base a parley, my teeth shall tear</li>
  <li>The slavish motive of recanting fear,</li>
  <li>And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,</li>
  <li data-number="195">Where shame doth harbor, even in Mowbray’s face.</li>

<h4>The Duke of Lancaster’s palace.</h4>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter John of Gaunt with the Duchess of Gloucester.
	
		GAUNT.
		DUCH.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="GAUNT.">
  <li>Alas, the part I had in Woodstock’s blood</li>
  <li>Doth more solicit me than your exclaims</li>
  <li>To stir against the butchers of his life!</li>
  <li>But since correction lieth in those hands</li>
  <li data-number="5">Which made the fault that we cannot correct,</li>
  <li>Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven,</li>
  <li>Who, when they see the hour’s ripe on earth,</li>
  <li>Will rain hot vengeance on offenders’ heads.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUCH.">
  <li>Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur?</li>
  <li data-number="10">Hath love in thy old blood no living fire?</li>
  <li>Edward’s seven sons, whereof thyself art one,</li>
  <li>Were as seven vials of his sacred blood,</li>
  <li>Or seven fair branches springing from one root.</li>
  <li>Some of those seven are dried by nature’s course,</li>
  <li data-number="15">Some of those branches by the Destinies cut;</li>
  <li>But Thomas, my dear lord, my life, my Gloucester,</li>
  <li>One vial full of Edward’s sacred blood,</li>
  <li>One flourishing branch of his most royal root,</li>
  <li>Is crack’d, and all the precious liquor spilt,</li>
  <li data-number="20">Is hack’d down, and his summer leaves all faded,</li>
  <li>By envy’s hand and murder’s bloody axe.</li>
  <li>Ah, Gaunt, his blood was thine! That bed, that womb,</li>
  <li>That mettle, that self mould, that fashioned thee</li>
  <li>Made him a man; and though thou livest and breathest,</li>
  <li data-number="25">Yet art thou slain in him. Thou dost consent</li>
  <li>In some large measure to thy father’s death,</li>
  <li>In that thou seest thy wretched brother die,</li>
  <li>Who was the model of thy father’s life.</li>
  <li>Call it not patience, Gaunt, it is despair.</li>
  <li data-number="30">In suff’ring thus thy brother to be slaught’red,</li>
  <li>Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life,</li>
  <li>Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee.</li>
  <li>That which in mean men we entitle patience</li>
  <li>Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.</li>
  <li data-number="35">What shall I say? To safeguard thine own life</li>
  <li>The best way is to venge my Gloucester’s death.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GAUNT.">
  <li>God’s is the quarrel, for God’s substitute,</li>
  <li>His deputy anointed in His sight,</li>
  <li>Hath caus’d his death, the which if wrongfully,</li>
  <li data-number="40">Let heaven revenge, for I may never lift</li>
  <li>An angry arm against His minister.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUCH.">
  <li>Where then, alas, may I complain myself?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GAUNT.">
  <li>To God, the widow’s champion and defense.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUCH.">
  <li>Why then I will. Farewell, old Gaunt!</li>
  <li data-number="45">Thou goest to Coventry, there to behold</li>
  <li>Our cousin Herford and fell Mowbray fight.</li>
  <li>O, sit my husband’s wrongs on Herford’s spear,</li>
  <li>That it may enter butcher Mowbray’s breast!</li>
  <li>Or if misfortune miss the first career,</li>
  <li data-number="50">Be Mowbray’s sins so heavy in his bosom</li>
  <li>That they may break his foaming courser’s back,</li>
  <li>And throw the rider headlong in the lists,</li>
  <li>A caitiff recreant to my cousin Herford!</li>
  <li>Farewell, old Gaunt! Thy sometimes brother’s wife</li>
  <li data-number="55">With her companion, grief, must end her life.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GAUNT.">
  <li>Sister, farewell, I must to Coventry.</li>
  <li>As much good stay with thee as go with me!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUCH.">
  <li>Yet one word more! Grief boundeth where it falls,</li>
  <li>Not with the empty hollowness, but weight.</li>
  <li data-number="60">I take my leave before I have begun,</li>
  <li>For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done.</li>
  <li>Commend me to thy brother, Edmund York.</li>
  <li>Lo this is all—nay, yet depart not so;</li>
  <li>Though this be all, do not so quickly go;</li>
  <li data-number="65">I shall remember more. Bid him—ah, what?—</li>
  <li>With all good speed at Plashy visit me.</li>
  <li>Alack, and what shall good old York there see</li>
  <li>But empty lodgings and unfurnish’d walls,</li>
  <li>Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?</li>
  <li data-number="70">And what hear there for welcome but my groans?</li>
  <li>Therefore commend me; let him not come there</li>
  <li>To seek out sorrow that dwells every where.</li>
  <li>Desolate, desolate, will I hence and die:</li>
  <li>The last leave of thee takes my weeping eye.</li>

<ol data-speaker="BUSHY.">
  <li>Madam, your Majesty is too much sad.</li>
  <li>You promis’d, when you parted with the King,</li>
  <li>To lay aside life-harming heaviness</li>
  <li>And entertain a cheerful disposition.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN.">
  <li data-number="5">To please the King I did, to please myself</li>
  <li>I cannot do it; yet I know no cause</li>

  <li>As my sweet Richard. Yet again methinks</li>
  <li data-number="10">Some unborn sorrow, ripe in fortune’s womb,</li>
  <li>Is coming towards me, and my inward soul</li>
  <li>With nothing trembles; at some thing it grieves,</li>
  <li>More than with parting from my lord the King.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BUSHY.">
  <li>Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows,</li>
  <li data-number="15">Which shows like grief itself, but is not so;</li>
  <li>For sorrow’s eyes, glazed with blinding tears,</li>
  <li>Divides one thing entire to many objects,</li>
  <li>Like perspectives, which rightly gaz’d upon</li>
  <li>Show nothing but confusion; ey’d awry</li>
  <li data-number="20">Distinguish form; so your sweet Majesty,</li>
  <li>Looking awry upon your lord’s departure,</li>
  <li>Find shapes of grief, more than himself, to wail,</li>
  <li>Which, look’d on as it is, is nought but shadows</li>
  <li>Of what it is not; then, thrice-gracious Queen,</li>
  <li data-number="25">More than your lord’s departure weep not—more is not seen,</li>
  <li>Or if it be, ’tis with false sorrow’s eye,</li>
  <li>Which for things true weeps things imaginary.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN.">
  <li>It may be so; but yet my inward soul</li>
  <li>Persuades me it is otherwise. Howe’er it be,</li>
  <li data-number="30">I cannot but be sad; so heavy sad,</li>
  <li>As, though on thinking on no thought I think,</li>
  <li>Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BUSHY.">
  <li>’Tis nothing but conceit, my gracious lady.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN.">
  <li>’Tis nothing less: conceit is still deriv’d</li>
  <li data-number="35">From some forefather grief; mine is not so,</li>
  <li>For nothing hath begot my something grief,</li>
  <li>Or something hath the nothing that I grieve—</li>

  <li>Believe me, noble lord,</li>
  <li>I am a stranger here in Gloucestershire.</li>
  <li>These high wild hills and rough uneven ways</li>
  <li data-number="5">Draws out our miles and makes them wearisome,</li>
  <li>And yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar,</li>
  <li>Making the hard way sweet and delectable.</li>
  <li>But I bethink me what a weary way</li>
  <li>From Ravenspurgh to Cotshall will be found</li>
  <li data-number="10">In Ross and Willoughby, wanting your company,</li>
  <li>Which, I protest, hath very much beguil’d</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NORTH.">
  <li data-offset="5">What was his reason?</li>
  <li>He was not so resolv’d when last we spake together.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PERCY.">
  <li data-number="30">Because your lordship was proclaimed traitor.</li>

  <li>I never in my life did look on him.</li>

  <li>Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye.</li>
  <li>You are my father, for methinks in you</li>

  <li data-number="120">A wandering vagabond, my rights and royalties</li>

  <li>Yea, my lord. How brooks your Grace the air</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. RICH.">
  <li>Needs must I like it well; I weep for joy</li>
  <li data-number="5">To stand upon my kingdom once again.</li>
  <li>Dear earth, I do salute thee with my hand,</li>
  <li>Though rebels wound thee with their horses’ hoofs.</li>
  <li>As a long-parted mother with her child</li>
  <li>Plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting,</li>
  <li data-number="10">So weeping, smiling, greet I thee, my earth,</li>
  <li>And do thee favors with my royal hands.</li>
  <li>Feed not thy sovereign’s foe, my gentle earth,</li>
  <li>Nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense,</li>
  <li>But let thy spiders, that suck up thy venom,</li>
  <li data-number="15">And heavy-gaited toads lie in their way,</li>
  <li>Doing annoyance to the treacherous feet,</li>
  <li>Which with usurping steps do trample thee.</li>
  <li>Yield stinging nettles to mine enemies;</li>
  <li>And when they from thy bosom pluck a flower,</li>
  <li data-number="20">Guard it, I pray thee, with a lurking adder,</li>
  <li>Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch</li>
  <li>Throw death upon thy sovereign’s enemies.</li>
  <li>Mock not my senseless conjuration, lords,</li>
  <li>This earth shall have a feeling, and these stones</li>

<ol data-speaker="CAR.">
  <li>Fear not, my lord, that Power that made you king</li>

  <li>The means that heavens yield must be embrac’d,</li>

  <li>The proffered means of succors and redress.</li>

  <li>He means, my lord, that we are too remiss,</li>

<ol data-speaker="K. RICH.">
  <li>Discomfortable cousin, know’st thou not</li>

  <li data-number="40">In murders and in outrage boldly here,</li>
  <li>But when from under this terrestrial ball</li>
  <li>He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines</li>
  <li>And darts his light through every guilty hole,</li>
  <li>Then murders, treasons, and detested sins,</li>
  <li data-number="45">The cloak of night being pluck’d from off their backs,</li>
  <li>Stand bare and naked, trembling at themselves?</li>
  <li>So when this thief, this traitor Bullingbrook,</li>
  <li>Who all this while hath revell’d in the night,</li>
  <li>Whilst we were wand’ring with the antipodes,</li>

  <li>His treasons will sit blushing in his face,</li>
  <li>Not able to endure the sight of day,</li>
  <li>But self-affrighted tremble at his sin.</li>
  <li>Not all the water in the rough rude sea</li>
  <li data-number="55">Can wash the balm off from an anointed king;</li>
  <li>The breath of worldly men cannot depose</li>
  <li>The deputy elected by the Lord;</li>

  <li>O, call back yesterday, bid time return,</li>

  <li>Arm, arm, my name! A puny subject strikes</li>

  <li>Like an unseasonable stormy day,</li>

  <li>So high above his limits swells the rage</li>
  <li data-number="110">Of Bullingbrook, covering your fearful land</li>

  <li>White-beards have arm’d their thin and hairless scalps</li>
  <li>Against thy majesty; boys, with women’s voices,</li>
  <li>Strive to speak big, and clap their female joints</li>
  <li data-number="115">In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown;</li>
  <li>Thy very beadsmen learn to bend their bows</li>

  <li>If we prevail, their heads shall pay for it.</li>
  <li>I warrant they have made peace with Bullingbrook.</li>

  <li data-number="130">Dogs, easily won to fawn on any man!</li>
  <li>Snakes, in my heart-blood warm’d, that sting my heart!</li>
  <li>Three Judases, each one thrice worse than Judas!</li>

  <li data-number="135">Sweet love, I see, changing his property,</li>

  <li>Again uncurse their souls, their peace is made</li>
  <li>With heads, and not with hands. Those whom you curse</li>

  <li data-number="155">For God’s sake let us sit upon the ground</li>

  <li>For you have but mistook me all this while.</li>
  <li data-number="175">I live with bread like you, feel want,</li>

<h3>Scene 2</h3>

<h4>The Duke of York’s palace.</h4>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Duke of York and the Duchess of York.
	
		YORK.
		DUCH. YORK.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="DUCH. YORK.">
  <li>My lord, you told me you would tell the rest,</li>
  <li>When weeping made you break the story off,</li>
  <li>Of our two cousins coming into London.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK.">
  <li>Where did I leave?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUCH. YORK.">
  <li data-offset="4">At that sad stop, my lord,</li>
  <li data-number="5">Where rude misgoverned hands from windows’ tops</li>
  <li>Threw dust and rubbish on King Richard’s head.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK.">
  <li>Then, as I said, the Duke, great Bullingbrook,</li>
  <li>Mounted upon a hot and fiery steed,</li>
  <li>Which his aspiring rider seem’d to know,</li>
  <li data-number="10">With slow but stately pace kept on his course,</li>
  <li>Whilst all tongues cried, “God save thee, Bullingbrook!”</li>
  <li>You would have thought the very windows spake,</li>
  <li>So many greedy looks of young and old</li>
  <li>Through casements darted their desiring eyes</li>
  <li data-number="15">Upon his visage, and that all the walls</li>
  <li>With painted imagery had said at once,</li>
  <li>“Jesu preserve thee! Welcome, Bullingbrook!”</li>
  <li>Whilst he, from the one side to the other turning,</li>
  <li>Bare-headed, lower than his proud steed’s neck,</li>
  <li data-number="20">Bespake them thus: “I thank you, countrymen.”</li>
  <li>And thus still doing, thus he pass’d along.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUCH. YORK.">
  <li>Alack, poor Richard, where rode he the whilst?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK.">
  <li>As in a theatre the eyes of men,</li>
  <li>After a well-graced actor leaves the stage,</li>
  <li data-number="25">Are idly bent on him that enters next,</li>
  <li>Thinking his prattle to be tedious,</li>
  <li>Even so, or with much more contempt, men’s eyes</li>
  <li>Did scowl on gentle Richard. No man cried “God save him!”</li>
  <li>No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home,</li>
  <li data-number="30">But dust was thrown upon his sacred head,</li>
  <li>Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off,</li>
  <li>His face still combating with tears and smiles,</li>
  <li>The badges of his grief and patience,</li>
  <li>That had not God, for some strong purpose, steel’d</li>
  <li data-number="35">The hearts of men, they must perforce have melted,</li>
  <li>And barbarism itself have pitied him.</li>
  <li>But heaven hath a hand in these events,</li>
  <li>To whose high will we bound our calm contents.</li>
  <li>To Bullingbrook are we sworn subjects now,</li>
  <li>Whose state and honor I for aye allow.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Scene 5</h3>

<h4>The dungeon of Pomfret Castle.</h4>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Richard alone.
	
		K. RICH.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="K. RICH.">
  <li>I have been studying how I may compare</li>
  <li>This prison where I live unto the world;</li>
  <li>And for because the world is populous,</li>
  <li>And here is not a creature but myself,</li>
  <li data-number="5">I cannot do it; yet I’ll hammer it out.</li>
  <li>My brain I’ll prove the female to my soul,</li>
  <li>My soul the father, and these two beget</li>
  <li>A generation of still-breeding thoughts;</li>
  <li>And these some thoughts people this little world,</li>
  <li data-number="10">In humors like the people of this world:</li>
  <li>For no thought is contented. The better sort,</li>
  <li>As thoughts of things divine, are intermix’d</li>
  <li>With scruples and do set the word itself</li>
  <li>Against the word,</li>
  <li data-number="15">As thus: “Come, little ones,” and then again,</li>
  <li>“It is as hard to come as for a camel</li>
  <li>To thread the postern of a small needle’s eye.”</li>
  <li>Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot</li>
  <li>Unlikely wonders: how these vain weak nails</li>
  <li data-number="20">May tear a passage thorough the flinty ribs</li>
  <li>Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls;</li>
  <li>And for they cannot, die in their own pride.</li>
  <li>Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves</li>
  <li>That they are not the first of fortune’s slaves,</li>
  <li data-number="25">Nor shall not be the last—like seely beggars</li>
  <li>Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame,</li>
  <li>That many have and others must sit there;</li>
  <li>And in this thought they find a kind of ease,</li>
  <li>Bearing their own misfortunes on the back</li>
  <li data-number="30">Of such as have before endur’d the like.</li>
  <li>Thus play I in one person many people,</li>
  <li>And none contented. Sometimes am I king;</li>
  <li>Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar,</li>
  <li>And so I am. Then crushing penury</li>
  <li data-number="35">Persuades me I was better when a king;</li>
  <li>Then am I king’d again, and by and by</li>
  <li>Think that I am unking’d by Bullingbrook,</li>
  <li>And straight am nothing. But what e’er I be,</li>
  <li>Nor I, nor any man that but man is,</li>
  <li>With nothing shall be pleas’d, till he be eas’d</li>
  <li>With being nothing.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">
	The music plays.
	
	
</li>
  <li data-offset="5">Music do I hear?</li>
  <li>Ha, ha, keep time! How sour sweet music is</li>
  <li>When time is broke, and no proportion kept!</li>
  <li>So is it in the music of men’s lives.</li>
  <li data-number="45">And here have I the daintiness of ear</li>
  <li>To check time broke in a disordered string;</li>
  <li>But for the concord of my state and time</li>
  <li>Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.</li>
  <li>I wasted time, and now doth time waste me;</li>
  <li data-number="50">For now hath time made me his numb’ring clock:</li>
  <li>My thoughts are minutes, and with sighs they jar</li>
  <li>Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,</li>
  <li>Whereto my finger, like a dial’s point,</li>
  <li>Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.</li>
  <li data-number="55">Now, sir, the sound that tells what hour it is</li>
  <li>Are clamorous groans, which strike upon my heart,</li>
  <li>Which is the bell. So sighs, and tears, and groans</li>
  <li>Show minutes, times, and hours; but my time</li>
  <li>Runs posting on in Bullingbrook’s proud joy,</li>
  <li data-number="60">While I stand fooling here, his Jack of the clock.</li>
  <li>This music mads me, let it sound no more,</li>
  <li>For though it have holp mad men to their wits,</li>
  <li>In me it seems it will make wise men mad.</li>
  <li>Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me!</li>
  <li data-number="65">For ’tis a sign of love; and love to Richard</li>
  <li>Is a strange brooch in this all-hating world.</li>

  <li>So proud that Bullingbrook was on his back!</li>
  <li data-number="85">That jade hath eat bread from my royal hand,</li>
  <li>This hand hath made him proud with clapping him.</li>
  <li>Would he not stumble? Would he not fall down,</li>
  <li>Since pride must have a fall, and break the neck</li>
  <li>Of that proud man that did usurp his back?</li>
  <li data-number="90">Forgiveness, horse! Why do I rail on thee,</li>
  <li>Since thou, created to be aw’d by man,</li>
  <li>Wast born to bear? I was not made a horse,</li>
