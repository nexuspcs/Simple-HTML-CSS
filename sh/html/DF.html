<ol data-speaker="RODER.">
  <li>My gracious father, this unwonted strain</li>
  <li>Visits my heart with sadness.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li data-offset="6">Why, my son?</li>
  <li>Making my death familiar to my tongue</li>
  <li>Digs not my grave one jot before the date.</li>
  <li data-number="5">I’ve worn the garland of my honors long,</li>
  <li>And would not leave it wither’d to thy brow,</li>
  <li>But flourishing and green; worthy the man,</li>
  <li>Who, with my Dukedoms, heirs my better glories.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RODER.">
  <li>This praise, which is my pride, spreads me with blushes.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li data-number="10">Think not, that I can flatter thee, my Roderick;</li>
  <li>Or let the scale of love o’er-poise my judgment.</li>
  <li>Like a fair glass of retrospection, thou</li>
  <li>Reflect’st the virtues of my early youth;</li>
  <li>Making my old blood mend its pace with transport:</li>
  <li data-number="15">While fond Henriquez, thy irregular brother,</li>
  <li>Sets the large credit of his name at stake,</li>
  <li>A truant to my wishes, and his birth.</li>
  <li>His taints of wildness hurt our nicer honor,</li>
  <li>And call for swift reclaim.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RODER.">
  <li data-offset="6">I trust, my brother</li>
  <li data-number="20">Will, by the vantage of his cooler wisdom,</li>
  <li>E’er-while redeem the hot escapes of youth,</li>
  <li>And court opinion with a golden conduct.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li>Be thou a prophet in that kind suggestion!</li>
  <li>But I, by fears weighing his unweigh’d course,</li>
  <li data-number="25">Interpret for the future from the past.</li>
  <li>And strange misgivings, why he hath of late</li>
  <li>By importunity, and strain’d petition,</li>
  <li>Wrested our leave of absence from the court,</li>
  <li>Awake suspicion. Thou art inward with him;</li>
  <li data-number="30">And, haply, from the bosom’d trust can’st shape</li>
  <li>Some formal cause to qualify my doubts.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RODER.">
  <li>Why he hath press’d this absence, sir, I know not;</li>
  <li>But have his letters of a modern date,</li>
  <li>Wherein by Julio, good Camillo’s son,</li>
  <li data-number="35">(Who, as he says, shall follow hard upon;</li>
  <li>And whom I with the growing hour expect)</li>
  <li>He doth solicit the return of gold</li>
  <li>To purchase certain horse, that like him well.</li>
  <li>This Julio he encounter’d first in France,</li>
  <li data-number="40">And lovingly commends him to my favor;</li>
  <li>Wishing, I would detain him some few days,</li>
  <li>To know the value of his well-placed trust.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li>O, do it, Roderick; and assay to mould him</li>
  <li>An honest spy upon thy brother’s riots.</li>
  <li data-number="45">Make us acquainted when the youth arrives;</li>
  <li>We’ll see this Julio, and he shall from us</li>
  <li>Receive the secret loan his friend requires.</li>
  <li>Bring him to court.</li>

<h3>Scene 2</h3>

<h4>Prospect of a village at a distance.</h4>

<div class="stage-direction">
				Enter Camillo with a letter.
				
					CAM.
				
			</div>

<ol data-speaker="CAM.">
  <li>How comes the Duke to take such notice of my son, that he must needs have him in court, and I must send him upon the view of his letter?—Horsemanship! What horsemanship has Julio? I think, he can no more but gallop a hackney, unless he practiced riding in France. It may be, he did so; for he was there a good continuance. But I have not heard him speak much of his horsemanship. That’s no matter: if he be not a good horseman, all’s one in such a case, he must bear. Princes are absolute; they may do what they will in any thing, save what they cannot do.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">
					Enter Julio.
					
						JUL.
					
				</li>
  <li>O, come on, sir; read this paper: no more ado, but read it: it must not be answer’d by my hand, nor yours, but, in gross, by your person; your sole person. Read aloud.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JUL.">
  <li>Please you, to let me first o’erlook it, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAM.">
  <li>I was this other day in a spleen against your new suits: I do now think, some fate was the tailor that hath fitted them: for, this hour, they are for the palace of the Duke. Your father’s house is too dusty.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JUL.">
  <li class="stage-direction">
					Aside.
					
						JUL.
					
				</li>
  <li data-number="5">Hem!—to court? Which is the better, to serve a mistress, or a Duke? I am sued to be his slave, and I sue to be Leonora’s.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAM.">
  <li>You shall find your horsemanship much praised there; are you so good a horseman?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JUL.">
  <li>I have been,</li>
  <li>E’er now, commended for my seat, or mock’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAM.">
  <li>Take one commendation with another, every third’s a mock. Affect not therefore to be praised. Here’s a deal of command and entreaty mixt; there’s no denying; you must go; peremptorily he enforces that.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JUL.">
  <li class="stage-direction">
					Aside.
					
						JUL.
					
				</li>
  <li data-number="10">What fortune soever my going shall encounter, cannot be good fortune; what I part withal unseasons any other goodness.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAM.">
  <li>You must needs go; he rather conjures than importunes.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JUL.">
  <li class="stage-direction">
					Aside.
					
						JUL.
					
				</li>
  <li>No moving of my love-suit to him now?</li>

  <li>Great fortunes have grown out of less grounds.</li>

						JUL.
					
				</li>
  <li>What may her father think of me, who expects to be solicited this very night?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAM.">
  <li data-number="15">Those scatter’d pieces of virtue, which are in him, the court will solder together, varnish, and rectify.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JUL.">
  <li>He will surely think I deal too slightly, or unmannerly, or foolishly, indeed; nay, dishonestly; to bear him in hand with my father’s consent, who yet hath not been touch’d with so much as a request to it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAM.">
  <li>Well, sir, have you read it over?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JUL.">
  <li>Yes, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAM.">
  <li>And consider’d it?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JUL.">
  <li data-number="20">As I can.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAM.">
  <li>If you are courted by good fortune, you must go.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JUL.">
  <li>So it please you, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAM.">
  <li>By any means, and tomorrow: is it not there the limit of his request?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JUL.">
  <li>It is, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAM.">
  <li data-number="25">I must bethink me of some necessaries, without which you might be unfurnish’d: and my supplies shall at all convenience follow you. Come to my closet by and by; I would there speak with you.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">
				Exit Camillo. Manet Julio solus.
				
					CAM.
				
			</div>

<ol data-speaker="JUL.">
  <li>I do not see that fervor in the maid,</li>
  <li>Which youth and love should kindle. She consents,</li>
  <li>As ’twere to feed without an appetite;</li>
  <li>Tells me, she is content; and plays the coy one,</li>
  <li data-number="30">Like those that subtly make their words their ward,</li>
  <li>Keeping address at distance. This affection</li>
  <li>Is such a feign’d one, as will break untouch’d;</li>
  <li>Die frosty, e’er it can be thaw’d; while mine,</li>
  <li>Like to a clime beneath Hyperion’s eye,</li>
  <li data-number="35">Burns with one constant heat. I’ll straight go to her;</li>
  <li>Pray her to regard my honor: but she greets me.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">
					Enter Leonora, and maid.
					
						LEON.
					
				</li>
  <li>See, how her beauty doth enrich the place!</li>
  <li>O, add the music of thy charming tongue,</li>
  <li>Sweet as the lark that wakens up the morn,</li>
  <li data-number="40">And make me think it paradise indeed.</li>
  <li>I was about to seek thee, Leonora,</li>
  <li>And chide thy coldness, love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li data-offset="6">What says your father?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JUL.">
  <li>I have not mov’d him yet.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li data-offset="6">Then do not, Julio.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JUL.">
  <li>Not move him? Was it not your own command,</li>
  <li data-number="45">That his consent should ratify our loves?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li>Perhaps, it was: but now I’ve chang’d my mind.</li>
  <li>You purchase at too dear a rate, that puts you</li>
  <li>To woo me and your father too: besides,</li>
  <li>As he, perchance, may say, you shall not have me;</li>
  <li data-number="50">You, who are so obedient, must discharge me</li>
  <li>Out of your fancy: then, you know, ’twill prove</li>
  <li>My shame and sorrow, meeting such repulse,</li>
  <li>To wear the willow in my prime of youth.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JUL.">
  <li>Oh! Do not rack me with these ill-placed doubts;</li>
  <li data-number="55">Nor think, though age has in my father’s breast</li>
  <li>Put out love’s flame, he therefore has not eyes,</li>
  <li>Or is in judgment blind. You wrong your beauties,</li>
  <li>Venus will frown if you disprize her gifts,</li>
  <li>That have a face would make a frozen hermit</li>
  <li data-number="60">Leap from his cell, and burn his beads to kiss it;</li>
  <li>Eyes, that are nothing but continual births</li>
  <li>Of new desires in those that view their beams.</li>
  <li>You cannot have a cause to doubt.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li data-offset="7">Why, Julio?</li>
  <li>When you that dare not choose without your father,</li>
  <li data-number="65">And, where you love, you dare not vouch it; must not,</li>
  <li>Though you have eyes, see with ’em;—can I, think you,</li>
  <li>Somewhat, perhaps, infected with your suit,</li>
  <li>Sit down content to say, you would, but dare not?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JUL.">
  <li>Urge not suspicions of what cannot be;</li>
  <li data-number="70">You deal unkindly; misbecomingly,</li>
  <li>I’m loathe to say: for all that waits on you,</li>
  <li>Is graced, and graces. No impediment</li>
  <li>Shall bar my wishes, but such grave delays</li>
  <li>As reason presses patience with; which blunt not,</li>
  <li data-number="75">But rather whet our loves. Be patient, sweet.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li>Patient! What else? My flames are in the flint.</li>
  <li>Haply, to lose a husband I may weep;</li>
  <li>Never, to get one: when I cry for bondage,</li>
  <li>Let freedom quit me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JUL.">
  <li data-offset="5">From what a spirit comes this?</li>
  <li data-number="80">I now perceive too plain, you care not for me.</li>
  <li>Duke, I obey thy summons, be its tenor</li>
  <li>Whate’er it will: if war, I come thy soldier:</li>
  <li>Or if to waste my silken hours at court,</li>
  <li>The slave of fashion, I with willing soul</li>
  <li data-number="85">Embrace the lazy banishment for life;</li>
  <li>Since Leonora has pronounc’d my doom.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li>What do you mean? Why talk you of the Duke?</li>
  <li>Wherefore of war, or court, or banishment?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JUL.">
  <li>How this new note is grown of me, I know not;</li>
  <li data-number="90">But the Duke writes for me. Coming to move</li>
  <li>My father in our bus’ness, I did find him</li>
  <li>Reading this letter; whose contents require</li>
  <li>My instant service, and repair to court.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li>Now I perceive the birth of these delays;</li>
  <li data-number="95">Why Leonora was not worth your suit.</li>
  <li>Repair to court? Ay, there you shall, perhaps,</li>
  <li>(Rather, past doubt) behold some choicer beauty,</li>
  <li>Rich in her charms, train’d to the arts of soothing,</li>
  <li>Shall prompt you to a spirit of hardiness,</li>
  <li>To say, “So please you, father, I have chosen</li>
  <li>This mistress for my own.”</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JUL.">
  <li data-offset="6">Still you mistake me:</li>
  <li>Ever your servant I profess myself;</li>
  <li>And will not blot me with a change, for all</li>
  <li>That sea and land inherit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li data-offset="6">But when go you?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JUL.">
  <li data-number="105">Tomorrow, love; so runs the Duke’s command;</li>
  <li>Stinting our farewell-kisses, cutting off</li>
  <li>The forms of parting, and the interchange</li>
  <li>Of thousand precious vows, with haste too rude.</li>
  <li>Lovers have things of moment to debate,</li>
  <li data-number="110">More than a prince, or dreaming statesman, know:</li>
  <li>Such ceremonies wait on cupid’s throne.</li>
  <li>Why heav’d that sigh?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li data-offset="5">O Julio, let me whisper</li>
  <li>What, but for parting, I should blush to tell thee:</li>
  <li>My heart beats thick with fears, lest the gay scene,</li>
  <li data-number="115">The splendors of a court, should from thy breast</li>
  <li>Banish my image, kill my int’rest in thee,</li>
  <li>And I be left, the scoff of maids, to drop</li>
  <li>A widow’s tear for thy departed faith.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JUL.">
  <li>O let assurance, strong as words can bind,</li>
  <li data-number="120">Tell thy pleas’d soul, I will be wond’rous faithful;</li>
  <li>True, as the sun is to his race of light,</li>
  <li>As shade to darkness, as desire to beauty:</li>
  <li>And when I swerve, let wretchedness o’ertake me,</li>
  <li>Great as e’er falsehood met, or change can merit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li data-number="125">Enough. I’m satisfied: and will remain</li>
  <li>Yours, with a firm and untir’d constancy.</li>
  <li>Make not your absence long: old men are wav’ring;</li>
  <li>And sway’d by int’rest more than promise giv’n.</li>
  <li>Should some fresh offer start, when you’re away,</li>
  <li data-number="130">I may be press’d to something, which must put</li>
  <li>My faith, or my obedience, to the rack.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JUL.">
  <li>Fear not, but I with swiftest wing of time</li>
  <li>Will labour my return. And in my absence,</li>
  <li>My noble friend, and now our honor’d guest,</li>
  <li data-number="135">The lord Henriquez, will in my behalf</li>
  <li>Hang at your father’s ear, and with kind hints,</li>
  <li>Pour’d from a friendly tongue, secure my claim;</li>
  <li>And play the lover for thy absent Julio.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li>Is there no instance of a friend turn’d false?</li>
  <li data-number="140">Take heed of that: no love by proxy, Julio.</li>
  <li>My father—</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">
				Enter Don Bernard.
				
					D. BERN.
				
			</div>

<ol data-speaker="D. BERN.">
  <li>What, Julio, in public? This wooing is too urgent. Is your father yet moved in the suit, who must be the prime unfolder of this business?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JUL.">
  <li>I have not yet, indeed, at full possess’d</li>
  <li>My father, whom it is my service follows;</li>
  <li data-number="145">But only that I have a wife in chase.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="D. BERN.">
  <li>Chase!—let chase alone; no matter for that. You may halt after her, whom you profess to pursue, and catch her too; marry, not unless your father let you slip.—Briefly, I desire you, (for she tells me, my instructions shall be both eyes and feet to her) no farther to insist in your requiring, ’till, as I have formerly said, Camillo make known to me, that his good liking goes along with us; which but once breath’d, all is done; ’till when, the business has no life, and cannot find a beginning.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JUL.">
  <li>Sir, I will know his mind, e’er I taste sleep:</li>
  <li>At morn, you shall be learn’d in his desire.</li>
  <li>I take my leave. O virtuous Leonora,</li>
  <li data-number="150">Repose, sweet as thy beauties, seal thy eyes;</li>
  <li>Once more, <foreign xml:lang="fr">adieu</foreign>. I have thy promise, love;</li>
  <li>Remember, and be faithful.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">
				Exit Julio.
				
					JUL.
				
			</div>

<ol data-speaker="D. BERN.">
  <li>His father is as unsettled, as he is wayward, in his disposition. If I thought young Julio’s temper were not mended by the metal of his mother, I should be something crazy in giving my consent to this match: and, to tell you true, if my eyes might be the directors to your mind, I could in this town look upon twenty men of more delicate choice. I speak not this altogether to unbend your affections to him: but the meaning of what I say is, that you set such price upon yourself to him, as many, and much his betters, would buy you at; (and reckon those virtues in you at the rate of their scarcity) to which if he come not up, you remain for a better mart.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li>My obedience, sir, is chain’d to your advice.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="D. BERN.">
  <li data-number="155">’Tis well said, and wisely. I fear, your lover is a little folly-tainted; which, shortly after it proves so, you will repent.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li>Sir, I confess, I approve him of all the men I know; but that approbation is nothing, ’till season’d by your consent.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="D. BERN.">
  <li>We shall hear soon what his father will do, and so proceed accordingly. I have no great heart to the business, neither will I with any violence oppose it: but leave it to that power which rules in these conjunctions, and there’s an end. Come, haste we homeward, girl.</li>

  <li>You’ve had my answer, and ’tis more than strange</li>
  <li>You’ll combat these repulses. Good my lord!</li>
  <li>Be friend to your own health; and give me leave,</li>
  <li>Securing my poor fame, nothing to pity</li>
  <li data-number="35">What pangs you swear you suffer. ’Tis impossible</li>

<ol data-speaker="HENR.">
  <li data-offset="7">Why, Violante?</li>

<ol data-speaker="VIOL.">
  <li>Alas! Sir, there are reasons numberless</li>
  <li>To bar your aims. Be warn’d to hours more wholesome;</li>
  <li data-number="40">For, these you watch in vain. I have read stories,</li>
  <li>(I fear, too true ones) how young lords, like you,</li>
  <li>Have thus besung mean windows, rhymed their suff’rings</li>
  <li>Ev’n to th’ abuse of things divine, set up</li>
  <li>Plain girls, like me, the idols of their worship,</li>
  <li>Then left them to bewail their easie faith,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HENR.">
  <li data-offset="7">Your memory,</li>

<ol data-speaker="VIOL.">
  <li data-offset="6">Let us be homely,</li>

  <li>What you can say, is most unseasonable; what sing,</li>
  <li>Most absonant and harsh: nay, your perfume,</li>

  <li data-number="5">All that at present I could boast my own,</li>
  <li>And the reversion of the world to boot,</li>
  <li>Had the inheritance been mine: and now,</li>
  <li>(Just doom of guilty joys!) I grieve as much</li>

  <li data-number="10">Those charms of innocence and artless love,</li>
  <li>As just before I was devour’d with sorrow,</li>
  <li>That she refus’d my vows, and shut the door</li>

  <li>Love! Love! Downright love! I see by the foolishness of it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HENR.">
  <li data-number="15">Now then to recollection—was’t not so? A promise first of marriage—not a promise only, for ’twas bound with surety of a thousand oaths—and those not light ones neither.</li>
  <li>Yet I remember too, those oaths could not prevail;</li>
  <li>Th’ unpractis’d maid trembled to meet my love:</li>
  <li>By force alone I snatch’d th’ imperfect joy,</li>
  <li>Which now torments my memory. Not love,</li>
  <li data-number="20">But brutal violence prevail’d; to which</li>

<ol data-speaker="HENR.">
  <li data-number="25">Hold, let me be severe to myself, but not unjust. Was it a rape then? No. Her shrieks, her exclamations then had drove me from her. True, she did not consent; as true, she did resist; but still in silence all.</li>
  <li>’Twas but the coyness of a modest bride,</li>
  <li>Not the resentment of a ravish’d maid.</li>
  <li>And is the man yet born, who would not risk</li>
  <li>The guilt, to meet the joy? The guilt! That’s true—</li>
  <li data-number="30">But then the danger; the tears, the clamors of the ruin’d maid, pursuing me to court. That, that, I fear will (as it already does my conscience) something shatter my honor. What’s to be done? But now I have no choice. Fair Leonora reigns confessed the tyrant queen of my revolted heart, and Violante seems a short usurper there. Julio’s already by my arts remov’d.—O friendship!</li>
  <li>How wilt thou answer that? Oh, that a man</li>
  <li>Could reason down this fever of the blood,</li>
  <li>Or sooth with words the tumult in his heart!</li>
  <li>Then, Julio, I might be, indeed, thy friend.</li>

  <li>Who born devoid of passion ne’er have prov’d</li>
  <li>The fierce disputes ’twixt virtue and desire.</li>

  <li>Where were the eyes, the voice, the various charms,</li>

  <li>Parents of glowing love? All these in her,</li>

<ol data-speaker="HENR.">
  <li>O kiss, sweet as the odors of the spring,</li>
  <li>But cold as dews that dwell on morning flow’rs!</li>
  <li>Say, Leonora, has your father conquer’d?</li>
  <li data-number="30">Shall duty then at last obtain the prize,</li>
  <li>Which you refus’d to love? And shall Henriquez</li>
  <li>Owe all his happiness to good Bernardo?</li>
  <li>Ah! No; I read my ruin in your eyes:</li>
  <li>That sorrow, louder than a thousand tongues,</li>
  <li>Pronounces my despair.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="D. BERN.">
  <li data-number="35" data-offset="7">Come, Leonora,</li>
  <li>You are not now to learn, this noble lord,</li>
  <li>(Whom but to name, restores my failing age,)</li>
  <li>Has with a lover’s eye beheld your beauty;</li>
  <li>Through which his heart speaks more than language can;</li>
  <li data-number="40">It offers joy and happiness to you,</li>
  <li>And honor to our house. Imagine then</li>
  <li>The birth and qualities of him that loves you;</li>
  <li>Which when you know, you cannot rate too dear.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li>My father, on my knees I do beseech you</li>
  <li data-number="45">To pause one moment on your daughter’s ruin.</li>
  <li>I vow, my heart ev’n bleeds, that I must thank you</li>
  <li>For your past tenderness; and yet distrust</li>
  <li>That which is yet behind. Consider, sir,</li>
  <li>Whoe’er’s th’ occasion of another’s fault,</li>
  <li data-number="50">Cannot himself be innocent. O, give not</li>
  <li>The censuring world occasion to reproach</li>
  <li>Your harsh commands; or to my charge lay that</li>
  <li>Which most I fear, the fault of disobedience.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="D. BERN.">
  <li>Prithee, fear neither the one, nor the other: I tell thee, girl, there’s more fear than danger. For my own part, as soon as thou art married to this noble lord, my fears will be over.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li data-number="55">Sir, I should be the vainest of my sex,</li>
  <li>Not to esteem myself unworthy far</li>
  <li>Of this high honor. Once there was a time,</li>
  <li>When to have heard my lord Henriquez’ vows,</li>
  <li>Might have subdued my unexperienc’d heart,</li>
  <li data-number="60">And made me wholly his.—But that’s now past:</li>
  <li>And my firm-plighted faith by your consent</li>
  <li>Was long since given to the injur’d Julio.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="D. BERN.">
  <li>Why then, by my consent e’en take it back again. Thou, like a simple wench, hast given thy affections to a fellow, that does not care a farthing for them. One, that has left thee for a jaunt to court; as who should say, “I’ll get a place now; ’tis time enough to marry, when I’m turn’d out of it.”</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HENR.">
  <li>So, surely, it should seem, most lovely maid;</li>
  <li data-number="65">Julio, alas, feels nothing of my passion:</li>
  <li>His love is but th’ amusement of an hour,</li>
  <li>A short relief from business, or ambition,</li>
  <li>The sport of youth, and fashion of the age.</li>
  <li>O! Had he known the hopes, the doubts, the ardors,</li>
  <li data-number="70">Or half the fond varieties of passion,</li>
  <li>That play the tyrant with my tortur’d soul;</li>
  <li>He had not left thee to pursue his fortune:</li>
  <li>To practice cringes in a slavish circle,</li>
  <li>And barter real bliss for unsure honor.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li data-number="75">Oh, the opposing wind,</li>
  <li>Should’ring the tide, makes here a fearful billow:</li>
  <li>I needs must perish in it.—Oh, my lord,</li>
  <li>Is it then possible, you can forget</li>
  <li>What’s due to your great name, and princely birth,</li>
  <li data-number="80">To friendship’s holy law, to faith repos’d,</li>
  <li>To truth, to honor, and poor injur’d Julio?</li>
  <li>O think, my lord, how much this Julio loves you;</li>
  <li>Recall his services, his well-tried faith;</li>
  <li>Think too, this very hour, where’er he be,</li>
  <li data-number="85">Your favor is the envy of the court,</li>
  <li>And secret triumph of his grateful heart.</li>
  <li>Poor Julio, how securely thou depend’st</li>
  <li>Upon the faith and honor of thy master;</li>
  <li>Mistaken youth! This very hour he robs thee</li>
  <li data-number="90">Of all thy heart holds dear. ’Tis so Henriquez</li>

  <li>(O holy heav’n, that she were living now!)</li>
  <li data-number="100">Forgive and pity me.—Oh, sir, remember,</li>
  <li>I’ve heard my mother say a thousand times,</li>
  <li>Her father would have forced her virgin choice;</li>
  <li>But when the conflict was ’twixt love and duty,</li>
  <li>Which should be first obey’d, my mother quickly</li>
  <li data-number="105">Paid up her vows to love, and married you.</li>
  <li>You thought this well, and she was praised for this;</li>
  <li>For this her name was honor’d, disobedience</li>
  <li>Was ne’er imputed to her, her firm love</li>
  <li>Conquer’d whate’er oppos’d it, and she prosper’d</li>
  <li data-number="110">Long time your wife. My case is now the same;</li>
  <li>You are the father, which you then condemn’d;</li>
  <li>I, what my mother was; but not so happy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="D. BERN.">
  <li>Go to, you’re a fool. No doubt, you have old stories enough to undo you. What, you can’t throw yourself away but by precedent, ha? You will needs be married to one, that will none of you? You will be happy no body’s way but your own, forsooth. But, d’ye mark me, spare your tongue for the future; (and that’s using you hardly too, to bid you spare what you have a great deal too much of) go, go your ways, and d’ye hear, get ready within these two days to be married to a husband you don’t deserve. Do it, or, by my dead father’s soul, you are no acquaintance of mine.</li>

  <li>No way for my escape, but through the flames.</li>
  <li>Oh, can I e’er resolve to live without</li>
  <li>A father’s blessing, or abandon Julio?</li>
  <li>With other maids, the choice were not so hard;</li>
  <li data-number="120">Int’rest, that rules the world, has made at last</li>
  <li>A merchandize of hearts: and virgins now</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="D. BERN.">
  <li>Please to name it, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAM.">
  <li>Sir, I have long held you in singular esteem: and what I shall now say, will be a proof of it. You know, sir, I have but one son.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="D. BERN.">
  <li data-number="130">Ay, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAM.">
  <li>And the fortune I am blest withal, you pretty well know what it is.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="D. BERN.">
  <li>’Tis a fair one, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAM.">
  <li>Such as it is, the whole reversion is my son’s. He is now engaged in his attendance on our master, the Duke. But e’er he went, he left with me the secret of his heart, his love for your fair daughter. For your consent, he said, ’twas ready. I took a night, indeed, to think upon it, and now have brought you mine; and am come to bind the contract with half my fortune in present, the whole some time hence, and, in the mean while, my hearty blessing. Ha? What say you to’t, Don Bernard?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="D. BERN.">
  <li>Why, really, neighbor,—I must own, I have heard something of this matter.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAM.">
  <li data-number="135">Heard something of it? No doubt, you have.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="D. BERN.">
  <li>Yes, now I recollect it well.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAM.">
  <li>Was it so long ago then?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="D. BERN.">
  <li>Very long ago, neighbor. On Tuesday last.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAM.">
  <li>What, am I mock’d in this business, Don Bernard?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="D. BERN.">
  <li data-number="140">Not mock’d, good Camillo, not mock’d: but in love-matters, you know, there are abundance of changes in half an hour. Time, time, neighbor, plays tricks with all of us.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAM.">
  <li>Time, sir! What tell you me of time? Come, I see how this goes. Can a little time take a man by the shoulder, and shake off his honor? Let me tell you, neighbor, it must either be a strong wind, or a very mellow honesty that drops so easily. Time, quoth’a?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="D. BERN.">
  <li>Look’e, Camillo; will you please to put your indignation in your pocket for half a moment, while I tell you the whole truth of the matter. My daughter, you must know, is such a tender soul, she cannot possibly see a Duke’s younger son without falling desperately in love with him. Now, you know, neighbor, when greatness rides post after a man of my years, ’tis both prudence, and good breeding, to let one’s self be overtaken by it. And who can help all this? I profess, it was not my seeking, neighbor.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAM.">
  <li>I profess, a fox might earth in the hollowness of your heart, neighbor, and there’s an end. If I were to give a bad conscience its true likeness, it should be drawn after a very near neighbor to a certain poor neighbor of yours.—Neighbor! With a pox!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="D. BERN.">
  <li>Nay, you are so nimble with me, you will hear nothing.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAM.">
  <li data-number="145">Sir, if I must speak nothing, I will hear nothing. As for what you have to say, if it comes from your heart, ’tis a lie before you speak it. I’ll to Leonora; and if I find her in the same story, why, I shall believe your wife was true to you, and your daughter is your own. Fare you well.</li>

  <li data-number="15">It self in death, this new surmise of mine</li>

  <li>Of mutual injuries, ’till our eyes run o’er,</li>
  <li>And we infect each other, with fresh sorrows.</li>
  <li>Talk’d you of comfort? ’Tis the food of fools,</li>
  <li>And we will none on’t; but indulge despair:</li>
  <li data-offset="2">So, worn with griefs, steal to the cave of death,</li>
