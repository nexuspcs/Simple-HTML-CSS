  <li>Hence! Home, you idle creatures, get you home!</li>
  <li>Is this a holiday? What, know you not,</li>
  <li>Being mechanical, you ought not walk</li>
  <li>Upon a laboring day without the sign</li>
  <li data-number="5">Of your profession? Speak, what trade art thou?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAR.">
  <li>Why, sir, a carpenter.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MUR.">
  <li>Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?</li>
  <li>What dost thou with thy best apparel on?</li>
  <li>You, sir, what trade are you?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COB.">
  <li data-number="10">Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am but, as you would say, a cobbler.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MUR.">
  <li>But what trade art thou? Answer me directly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COB.">
  <li>A trade, sir, that I hope I may use with a safe conscience, which is indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FLAV.">
  <li>What trade, thou knave? Thou naughty knave, what trade?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COB.">
  <li>Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me; yet if you be out, sir, I can mend you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MUR.">
  <li data-number="15">What mean’st thou by that? Mend me, thou saucy fellow?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COB.">
  <li>Why, sir, cobble you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FLAV.">
  <li>Thou art a cobbler, art thou?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COB.">
  <li>Truly, sir, all that I live by is with the awl: I meddle with no tradesman’s matters, nor women’s matters; but withal I am indeed, sir, a surgeon to old shoes; when they are in great danger, I recover them. As proper men as ever trod upon neat’s-leather have gone upon my handiwork.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FLAV.">
  <li>But wherefore art not in thy shop today?</li>
  <li data-number="20">Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COB.">
  <li>Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes, to get myself into more work. But indeed, sir, we make holiday to see Caesar, and to rejoice in his triumph.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MUR.">
  <li>Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?</li>
  <li>What tributaries follow him to Rome,</li>
  <li>To grace in captive bonds his chariot-wheels?</li>
  <li data-number="25">You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!</li>
  <li>O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,</li>
  <li>Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft</li>
  <li>Have you climb’d up to walls and battlements,</li>
  <li>To tow’rs and windows, yea, to chimney-tops,</li>
  <li data-number="30">Your infants in your arms, and there have sate</li>
  <li>The livelong day, with patient expectation,</li>
  <li>To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome;</li>
  <li>And when you saw his chariot but appear,</li>
  <li>Have you not made an universal shout,</li>
  <li data-number="35">That Tiber trembled underneath her banks</li>
  <li>To hear the replication of your sounds</li>
  <li>Made in her concave shores?</li>
  <li>And do you now put on your best attire?</li>
  <li>And do you now cull out a holiday?</li>
  <li data-number="40">And do you now strew flowers in his way,</li>
  <li>That comes in triumph over Pompey’s blood?</li>
  <li>Be gone!</li>
  <li>Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,</li>
  <li>Pray to the gods to intermit the plague</li>
  <li data-number="45">That needs must light on this ingratitude.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FLAV.">
  <li>Go, go, good countrymen, and for this fault</li>
  <li>Assemble all the poor men of your sort;</li>
  <li>Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears</li>
  <li>Into the channel, till the lowest stream</li>
  <li data-number="50">Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">
	Exeunt all the Commoners.
	
		Commoners
	
</li>
  <li>See whe’er their basest metal be not mov’d;</li>
  <li>They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.</li>
  <li>Go you down that way towards the Capitol,</li>
  <li>This way will I. Disrobe the images,</li>
  <li data-number="55">If you do find them deck’d with ceremonies.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MUR.">
  <li>May we do so?</li>
  <li>You know it is the feast of <date when=" — 02-15" type="holiday" subtype="Roman">Lupercal</date>.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FLAV.">
  <li>It is no matter, let no images</li>
  <li>Be hung with Caesar’s trophies, I’ll about,</li>
  <li data-number="60">And drive away the vulgar from the streets;</li>
  <li>So do you too, where you perceive them thick.</li>
  <li>These growing feathers pluck’d from Caesar’s wing</li>
  <li>Will make him fly an ordinary pitch,</li>
  <li>Who else would soar above the view of men,</li>
  <li data-number="65">And keep us all in servile tearfulness.</li>

  <li data-number="25">Will you go see the order of the course?</li>

<ol data-speaker="BRU.">
  <li>Not I.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAS.">
  <li>I pray you do.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BRU.">
  <li>I am not gamesome; I do lack some part</li>
  <li>Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.</li>
  <li data-number="30">Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires;</li>
  <li>I’ll leave you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAS.">
  <li>Brutus, I do observe you now of late;</li>
  <li>I have not from your eyes that gentleness</li>
  <li>And show of love as I was wont to have.</li>
  <li>You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand</li>
  <li>Over your friend that loves you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BRU.">
  <li data-offset="7">Cassius,</li>
  <li>Be not deceiv’d. If I have veil’d my look,</li>
  <li>I turn the trouble of my countenance</li>
  <li>Merely upon myself. Vexed I am</li>
  <li data-number="40">Of late with passions of some difference,</li>
  <li>Conceptions only proper to myself,</li>
  <li>Which give some soil, perhaps, to my behaviors;</li>
  <li>But let not therefore my good friends be griev’d</li>
  <li>(Among which number, Cassius, be you one),</li>
  <li data-number="45">Nor construe any further my neglect,</li>
  <li>Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,</li>
  <li>Forgets the shows of love to other men.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAS.">
  <li>Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion,</li>
  <li>By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried</li>
  <li data-number="50">Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.</li>
  <li>Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BRU.">
  <li>No, Cassius; for the eye sees not itself</li>
  <li>But by reflection, by some other things.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAS.">
  <li>’Tis just,</li>
  <li data-number="55">And it is very much lamented, Brutus,</li>
  <li>That you have no such mirrors as will turn</li>
  <li>Your hidden worthiness into your eye,</li>
  <li>That you might see your shadow. I have heard</li>
  <li>Where many of the best respect in Rome</li>
  <li data-number="60">(Except immortal Caesar), speaking of Brutus</li>
  <li>And groaning underneath this age’s yoke,</li>
  <li>Have wish’d that noble Brutus had his eyes.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BRU.">
  <li>Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,</li>
  <li>That you would have me seek into myself</li>
  <li data-number="65">For that which is not in me?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAS.">
  <li>Therefore, good Brutus, be prepar’d to hear;</li>
  <li>And since you know you cannot see yourself</li>
  <li>So well as by reflection, I, your glass,</li>
  <li>Will modestly discover to yourself</li>
  <li data-number="70">That of yourself which you yet know not of.</li>
  <li>And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus:</li>
  <li>Were I a common laughter, or did use</li>
  <li>To stale with ordinary oaths my love</li>
  <li>To every new protester; if you know</li>
  <li data-number="75">That I do fawn on men and hug them hard,</li>
  <li>And after scandal them; or if you know</li>
  <li>That I profess myself in banqueting</li>
  <li>To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Flourish and shout.
	
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="BRU.">
  <li>What means this shouting? I do fear the people</li>
  <li>Choose Caesar for their king.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAS.">
  <li data-number="80" data-offset="6">Ay, do you fear it?</li>
  <li>Then must I think you would not have it so.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BRU.">
  <li>I would not, Cassius, yet I love him well.</li>
  <li>But wherefore do you hold me here so long?</li>
  <li>What is it that you would impart to me?</li>
  <li data-number="85">If it be aught toward the general good,</li>
  <li>Set honor in one eye and death i’ th’ other,</li>
  <li>And I will look on both indifferently;</li>
  <li>For let the gods so speed me as I love</li>
  <li>The name of honor more than I fear death.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAS.">
  <li data-number="90">I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,</li>
  <li>As well as I do know your outward favor.</li>
  <li>Well, honor is the subject of my story:</li>
  <li>I cannot tell what you and other men</li>
  <li>Think of this life; but, for my single self,</li>
  <li data-number="95">I had as lief not be as live to be</li>
  <li>In awe of such a thing as I myself.</li>
  <li>I was born free as Caesar, so were you;</li>
  <li>We both have fed as well, and we can both</li>
  <li>Endure the winter’s cold as well as he;</li>
  <li data-number="100">For once, upon a raw and gusty day,</li>
  <li>The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,</li>
  <li>Caesar said to me, “Dar’st thou, Cassius, now</li>
  <li>Leap in with me into this angry flood,</li>
  <li>And swim to yonder point?” Upon the word,</li>
  <li data-number="105">Accoutred as I was, I plunged in,</li>
  <li>And bade him follow; so indeed he did.</li>
  <li>The torrent roar’d, and we did buffet it</li>
  <li>With lusty sinews, throwing it aside</li>
  <li>And stemming it with hearts of controversy;</li>
  <li data-number="110">But ere we could arrive the point propos’d,</li>
  <li>Caesar cried, “Help me, Cassius, or I sink!”</li>
  <li>I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,</li>
  <li>Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder</li>
  <li>The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber</li>
  <li data-number="115">Did I the tired Caesar. And this man</li>
  <li>Is now become a god, and Cassius is</li>
  <li>A wretched creature, and must bend his body</li>
  <li>If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.</li>
  <li>He had a fever when he was in Spain,</li>
  <li data-number="120">And when the fit was on him, I did mark</li>
  <li>How he did shake—’tis true, this god did shake;</li>
  <li>His coward lips did from their color fly,</li>
  <li>And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world</li>
  <li>Did lose his lustre, I did hear him groan;</li>
  <li data-number="125">Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans</li>
  <li>Mark him, and write his speeches in their books,</li>
  <li>Alas, it cried, “Give me some drink, Titinius,”</li>
  <li>As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me</li>
  <li>A man of such a feeble temper should</li>
  <li data-number="130">So get the start of the majestic world</li>
  <li>And bear the palm alone.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Shout. Flourish.
	
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="BRU.">
  <li>Another general shout!</li>
  <li>I do believe that these applauses are</li>
  <li>For some new honors that are heap’d on Caesar.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAS.">
  <li data-number="135">Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world</li>
  <li>Like a Colossus, and we petty men</li>
  <li>Walk under his huge legs, and peep about</li>
  <li>To find ourselves dishonorable graves.</li>
  <li>Men at some time are masters of their fates;</li>
  <li data-number="140">The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,</li>
  <li>But in ourselves, that we are underlings.</li>
  <li>Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that “Caesar”?</li>
  <li>Why should that name be sounded more than yours?</li>
  <li>Write them together, yours is as fair a name;</li>
  <li data-number="145">Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;</li>
  <li>Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with ’em,</li>
  <li>“Brutus” will start a spirit as soon as “Caesar.”</li>
  <li>Now in the names of all the gods at once,</li>
  <li>Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed</li>
  <li data-number="150">That he is grown so great? Age, thou art sham’d!</li>
  <li>Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!</li>
  <li>When went there by an age since the great flood</li>
  <li>But it was fam’d with more than with one man?</li>
  <li>When could they say, till now, that talk’d of Rome,</li>
  <li data-number="155">That her wide walks encompass’d but one man?</li>
  <li>Now is it Rome indeed and room enough,</li>
  <li>When there is in it but one only man.</li>
  <li>O! You and I have heard our fathers say</li>
  <li>There was a Brutus once that would have brook’d</li>
  <li data-number="160">Th’ eternal devil to keep his state in Rome</li>
  <li>As easily as a king.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BRU.">
  <li>That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;</li>
  <li>What you would work me to, I have some aim.</li>
  <li>How I have thought of this, and of these times,</li>
  <li data-number="165">I shall recount hereafter. For this present,</li>
  <li>I would not (so with love I might entreat you)</li>
  <li>Be any further mov’d. What you have said</li>
  <li>I will consider; what you have to say</li>
  <li>I will with patience hear, and find a time</li>
  <li data-number="170">Both meet to hear and answer such high things.</li>
  <li>Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:</li>
  <li>Brutus had rather be a villager</li>
  <li>Than to repute himself a son of Rome</li>
  <li>Under these hard conditions as this time</li>
  <li data-number="175">Is like to lay upon us.</li>
</ol>

I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown—yet ’twas not a crown neither, ’twas one of these coronets—and as I told you, he put it by once; but for all that, to my thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he offer’d it to him again; then he put it by again; but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his fingers off it. And then he offer’d it the third time; he put it the third time by; and still as he refus’d it, the rabblement howted, and clapp’d their chopp’d hands, and threw up their sweaty night-caps, and utter’d such a deal of stinking breath because Caesar refus’d the crown, that it had, almost, chok’d Caesar, for he swounded, and fell down at it; and for mine own part, I durst not laugh, for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAS.">
  <li>But soft I pray you; what, did Caesar swound?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CASCA.">
  <li>He fell down in the market-place, and foam’d at mouth, and was speechless.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BRU.">
  <li>’Tis very like, he hath the falling sickness.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAS.">
  <li>No, Caesar hath it not; but you, and I,</li>
  <li data-number="235">And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CASCA.">
  <li>I know not what you mean by that, but I am sure Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not clap him and hiss him, according as he pleas’d and displeas’d them, as they use to do the players in the theatre, I am no true man.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BRU.">
  <li>What said he when he came unto himself?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CASCA.">
  <li>Marry, before he fell down, when he perceiv’d the common herd was glad he refus’d the crown, he pluck’d me ope his doublet, and offer’d them his throat to cut. And I had been a man of any occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word, I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so he fell. When he came to himself again, he said, if he had done or said any thing amiss, he desir’d their worships to think it was his infirmity. Three or four wenches, where I stood, cried, “Alas, good soul!” and forgave him with all their hearts. But there’s no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had stabb’d their mothers, they would have done no less.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BRU.">
  <li>And after that, he came thus sad away?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CASCA.">
  <li data-number="240">Ay.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAS.">
  <li>Did Cicero say any thing?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CASCA.">
  <li>Ay, he spoke Greek.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAS.">
  <li>To what effect?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CASCA.">
  <li>Nay, and I tell you that, I’ll ne’er look you i’ th’ face again. But those that understood him smil’d at one another, and shook their heads; but, for mine own part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more news too. Murellus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs off Caesar’s images, are put to silence. Fare you well. There was more foolery yet, if I could remember it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAS.">
  <li data-number="245">Will you sup with me tonight, Casca?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CASCA.">
  <li>No, I am promis’d forth.</li>

  <li>Will you dine with me tomorrow?</li>

<ol data-speaker="CIC.">
  <li>Good even, Casca; brought you Caesar home?</li>
  <li>Why are you breathless, and why stare you so?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CASCA.">
  <li>Are not you mov’d, when all the sway of earth</li>
  <li>Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero,</li>
  <li data-number="5">I have seen tempests when the scolding winds</li>
  <li>Have riv’d the knotty oaks, and I have seen</li>
  <li>Th’ ambitious ocean swell, and rage, and foam,</li>
  <li>To be exalted with the threat’ning clouds;</li>
  <li>But never till tonight, never till now,</li>
  <li data-number="10">Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.</li>
  <li>Either there is a civil strife in heaven,</li>
  <li>Or else the world, too saucy with the gods,</li>
  <li>Incenses them to send destruction.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CIC.">
  <li>Why, saw you any thing more wonderful?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CASCA.">
  <li data-number="15">A common slave—you know him well by sight—</li>
  <li>Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn</li>
  <li>Like twenty torches join’d; and yet his hand,</li>
  <li>Not sensible of fire, remain’d unscorch’d.</li>
  <li>Besides—I ha’ not since put up my sword—</li>
  <li data-number="20">Against the Capitol I met a lion,</li>
  <li>Who glaz’d upon me, and went surly by,</li>
  <li>Without annoying me. And there were drawn</li>
  <li>Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women,</li>
  <li>Transformed with their fear, who swore they saw</li>
  <li data-number="25">Men, all in fire, walk up and down the streets.</li>
  <li>And yesterday the bird of night did sit</li>
  <li>Even at noon-day upon the market-place,</li>
  <li>Howting and shrieking. When these prodigies</li>
  <li>Do so conjointly meet, let not men say,</li>
  <li data-number="30">“These are their reasons, they are natural”;</li>
  <li>For I believe they are portentous things</li>
  <li>Unto the climate that they point upon.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CIC.">
  <li>Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time;</li>
  <li>But men may construe things after their fashion,</li>

  <li>Comes Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow?</li>

<ol data-speaker="CASCA.">
  <li data-offset="3">A Roman.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAS.">
  <li data-offset="5">Casca, by your voice.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CASCA.">
  <li>Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAS.">
  <li>A very pleasing night to honest men.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CASCA.">
  <li>Who ever knew the heavens menace so?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAS.">
  <li data-number="45">Those that have known the earth so full of faults.</li>
  <li>For my part, I have walk’d about the streets,</li>
  <li>Submitting me unto the perilous night;</li>
  <li>And thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,</li>
  <li>Have bar’d my bosom to the thunder-stone;</li>
  <li data-number="50">And when the cross blue lightning seem’d to open</li>
  <li>The breast of heaven, I did present myself</li>
  <li>Even in the aim and very flash of it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CASCA.">
  <li>But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?</li>
  <li>It is the part of men to fear and tremble</li>
  <li data-number="55">When the most mighty gods by tokens send</li>
  <li>Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAS.">
  <li>You are dull, Casca; and those sparks of life</li>
  <li>That should be in a Roman you do want,</li>
  <li>Or else you use not. You look pale, and gaze,</li>
  <li data-number="60">And put on fear, and cast yourself in wonder,</li>
  <li>To see the strange impatience of the heavens;</li>
  <li>But if you would consider the true cause</li>
  <li>Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,</li>
  <li>Why birds and beasts from quality and kind,</li>
  <li data-number="65">Why old men, fools, and children calculate,</li>
  <li>Why all these things change from their ordinance,</li>
  <li>Their natures, and preformed faculties,</li>
  <li>To monstrous quality—why, you shall find</li>
  <li>That heaven hath infus’d them with these spirits,</li>
  <li data-number="70">To make them instruments of fear and warning</li>
  <li>Unto some monstrous state.</li>
  <li>Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man</li>
  <li>Most like this dreadful night,</li>
  <li>That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars</li>
  <li data-number="75">As doth the lion in the Capitol—</li>
  <li>A man no mightier than thyself, or me,</li>
  <li>In personal action, yet prodigious grown,</li>
  <li>And fearful, as these strange eruptions are.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CASCA.">
  <li>’Tis Caesar that you mean; is it not, Cassius?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAS.">
  <li data-number="80">Let it be who it is; for Romans now</li>
  <li>Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors;</li>
  <li>But woe the while, our fathers’ minds are dead,</li>
  <li>And we are govern’d with our mothers’ spirits;</li>
  <li>Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CASCA.">
  <li data-number="85">Indeed, they say, the senators tomorrow</li>
  <li>Mean to establish Caesar as a king;</li>
  <li>And he shall wear his crown by sea and land,</li>
  <li>In every place, save here in Italy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAS.">
  <li>I know where I will wear this dagger then;</li>
  <li data-number="90">Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius.</li>
  <li>Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong;</li>
  <li>Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat;</li>
  <li>Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,</li>
  <li>Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron,</li>
  <li data-number="95">Can be retentive to the strength of spirit;</li>
  <li>But life, being weary of these worldly bars,</li>
  <li>Never lacks power to dismiss itself.</li>
  <li>If I know this, know all the world besides,</li>
  <li>That part of tyranny that I do bear</li>
  <li>I can shake off at pleasure.</li>

  <li>So every bondman in his own hand bears</li>
  <li>The power to cancel his captivity.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAS.">
  <li>And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?</li>
  <li>Poor man, I know he would not be a wolf,</li>
  <li data-number="105">But that he sees the Romans are but sheep;</li>
  <li>He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.</li>
  <li>Those that with haste will make a mighty fire</li>
  <li>Begin it with weak straws. What trash is Rome?</li>
  <li>What rubbish and what offal? When it serves</li>
  <li data-number="110">For the base matter to illuminate</li>
  <li>So vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief,</li>
  <li>Where hast thou led me? I, perhaps, speak this</li>
  <li>Before a willing bondman; then I know</li>
  <li>My answer must be made. But I am arm’d,</li>
  <li data-number="115">And dangers are to me indifferent.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CASCA.">
  <li>You speak to Casca, and to such a man</li>
  <li>That is no fleering tell-tale. Hold, my hand.</li>
  <li>Be factious for redress of all these griefs,</li>
  <li>And I will set this foot of mine as far</li>
  <li>As who goes farthest.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAS.">
  <li data-number="120" data-offset="4">There’s a bargain made.</li>

  <li>Of honorable-dangerous consequence;</li>
  <li data-number="125">And I do know, by this they stay for me</li>
  <li>In Pompey’s Porch; for now, this fearful night,</li>

Censure me in your wisdom, and awake your senses, that you may the better judge. If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of Caesar’s, to him I say, that Brutus’ love to Caesar was no less than his. If then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer: Not that I lov’d Caesar less, but that I lov’d Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living, and die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live all freemen? As Caesar lov’d me, I weep for him; as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was valiant, I honor him; but, as he was ambitious, I slew him. There is tears for his love; joy for his fortune; honor for his valor; and death for his ambition. Who is here so base that would be a bondman? If any, speak, for him have I offended. Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If any, speak, for him have I offended. Who is here so vile that will not love his country? If any, speak, for him have I offended.

<ol data-speaker="BRU.">
  <li data-number="65">You have done that you should be sorry for.</li>
  <li>There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats;</li>
  <li>For I am arm’d so strong in honesty</li>
  <li>That they pass by me as the idle wind,</li>
  <li>Which I respect not. I did send to you</li>
  <li data-number="70">For certain sums of gold, which you denied me;</li>

  <li>By heaven, I had rather coin my heart</li>

  <li>From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash</li>
  <li data-number="75">By any indirection. I did send</li>

  <li>When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous</li>

  <li>Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come,</li>

  <li>Check’d like a bondman, all his faults observ’d,</li>
  <li>Set in a note-book, learn’d, and conn’d by rote,</li>
  <li>To cast into my teeth. O, I could weep</li>
  <li data-number="100">My spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger,</li>
  <li>And here my naked breast; within, a heart</li>
  <li>Dearer than Pluto’s mine, richer than gold:</li>
  <li>If that thou be’st a Roman, take it forth.</li>
  <li>I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart:</li>
  <li data-number="105">Strike as thou didst at Caesar; for I know,</li>

  <li data-number="110">O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb</li>
  <li>That carries anger as the flint bears fire,</li>

  <li data-number="75">(As Pompey was) am I compell’d to set</li>
  <li>Upon one battle all our liberties.</li>
  <li>You know that I held Epicurus strong,</li>

  <li>And partly credit things that do presage.</li>
  <li data-number="80">Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign</li>
  <li>Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perch’d,</li>
  <li>Gorging and feeding from our soldiers’ hands,</li>
  <li>Who to Philippi here consorted us.</li>
  <li>This morning are they fled away and gone,</li>
  <li data-number="85">And in their steads do ravens, crows, and kites</li>
  <li>Fly o’er our heads, and downward look on us</li>

  <li>The gods today stand friendly, that we may,</li>

  <li>But since the affairs of men rests still incertain,</li>
  <li>Let’s reason with the worst that may befall.</li>
  <li>If we do lose this battle, then is this</li>
  <li>The very last time we shall speak together:</li>
  <li data-number="100">What are you then determined to do?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BRU.">
  <li>Even by the rule of that philosophy</li>

  <li data-number="105">For fear of what might fall, so to prevent</li>
  <li>The time of life—arming myself with patience</li>
  <li>To stay the providence of some high powers</li>

  <li>No, Cassius, no. Think not, thou Roman,</li>
  <li>That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome;</li>
  <li>He bears too great a mind. But this same day</li>
  <li>Must end that work the ides of March begun.</li>
  <li data-number="115">And whether we shall meet again I know not;</li>
  <li>Therefore our everlasting farewell take:</li>
