<h3>Scene 1</h3>

<h4>Britain. The garden of Cymbeline’s palace.</h4>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter two Gentlemen.
	
		1. GENT.
		2. GENT.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="1. GENT.">
  <li>You do not meet a man but frowns. Our bloods</li>
  <li>No more obey the heavens than our courtiers’</li>
  <li>Still seem as does the King’s.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. GENT.">
  <li data-offset="6">But what’s the matter?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. GENT.">
  <li>His daughter, and the heir of ’s kingdom (whom</li>
  <li data-number="5">He purpos’d to his wive’s sole son—a widow</li>
  <li>That late he married), hath referr’d herself</li>
  <li>Unto a poor but worthy gentleman. She’s wedded,</li>
  <li>Her husband banish’d, she imprison’d: all</li>
  <li>Is outward sorrow, though I think the King</li>
  <li>Be touch’d at very heart.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. GENT.">
  <li data-number="10" data-offset="5">None but the King?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. GENT.">
  <li>He that hath lost her too; so is the Queen,</li>
  <li>That most desir’d the match. But not a courtier,</li>
  <li>Although they wear their faces to the bent</li>
  <li>Of the King’s looks, hath a heart that is not</li>
  <li>Glad at the thing they scowl at.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. GENT.">
  <li data-number="15" data-offset="7">And why so?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. GENT.">
  <li>He that hath miss’d the Princess is a thing</li>
  <li>Too bad for bad report; and he that hath her</li>
  <li>(I mean, that married her, alack, good man!</li>
  <li>And therefore banish’d) is a creature such</li>
  <li data-number="20">As, to seek through the regions of the earth</li>
  <li>For one his like, there would be something failing</li>
  <li>In him that should compare. I do not think</li>
  <li>So fair an outward and such stuff within</li>
  <li>Endows a man but he.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. GENT.">
  <li data-offset="4">You speak him far.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. GENT.">
  <li data-number="25">I do extend him, sir, within himself,</li>
  <li>Crush him together rather than unfold</li>
  <li>His measure duly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. GENT.">
  <li data-offset="4">What’s his name and birth?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. GENT.">
  <li>I cannot delve him to the root: his father</li>
  <li>Was call’d Sicilius, who did join his honor</li>
  <li data-number="30">Against the Romans with Cassibelan,</li>
  <li>But had his titles by Tenantius, whom</li>
  <li>He serv’d with glory and admir’d success:</li>
  <li>So gain’d the sur-addition Leonatus;</li>
  <li>And had (besides this gentleman in question)</li>
  <li data-number="35">Two other sons, who in the wars o’ th’ time</li>
  <li>Died with their swords in hand; for which their father,</li>
  <li>Then old and fond of issue, took such sorrow</li>
  <li>That he quit being, and his gentle lady,</li>
  <li>Big of this gentleman, our theme, deceas’d</li>
  <li data-number="40">As he was born. The King he takes the babe</li>
  <li>To his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,</li>
  <li>Breeds him and makes him of his bedchamber,</li>
  <li>Puts to him all the learnings that his time</li>
  <li>Could make him the receiver of, which he took,</li>
  <li data-number="45">As we do air, fast as ’twas minist’red,</li>
  <li>And in ’s spring became a harvest; liv’d in court</li>
  <li>(Which rare it is to do) most prais’d, most lov’d,</li>
  <li>A sample to the youngest, to th’ more mature</li>
  <li>A glass that feated them, and to the graver</li>
  <li data-number="50">A child that guided dotards. To his mistress</li>
  <li>(For whom he now is banish’d), her own price</li>
  <li>Proclaims how she esteem’d him; and his virtue</li>
  <li>By her election may be truly read,</li>
  <li>What kind of man he is.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. GENT.">
  <li data-offset="5">I honor him</li>
  <li>Even out of your report. But pray you tell me,</li>
  <li>Is she sole child to th’ King?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. GENT.">
  <li data-offset="6">His only child.</li>
  <li>He had two sons (if this be worth your hearing,</li>
  <li>Mark it), the eldest of them at three years old,</li>
  <li>I’ th’ swathing clothes the other, from their nursery</li>
  <li>Were stol’n, and to this hour no guess in knowledge</li>
  <li>Which way they went.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. GENT.">
  <li data-offset="4">How long is this ago?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. GENT.">
  <li>Some twenty years.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. GENT.">
  <li>That a king’s children should be so convey’d,</li>
  <li>So slackly guarded, and the search so slow,</li>
  <li>That could not trace them!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. GENT.">
  <li data-number="65" data-offset="5">Howsoe’er ’tis strange,</li>
  <li>Or that the negligence may well be laugh’d at,</li>
  <li>Yet is it true, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. GENT.">
  <li data-offset="3">I do well believe you.</li>

  <li>Believe it, sir, I have seen him in Britain. He was then of a crescent note, expected to prove so worthy as since he hath been allow’d the name of. But I could then have look’d on him without the help of admiration, though the catalogue of his endowments had been tabled by his side, and I to peruse him by items.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PHI.">
  <li>You speak of him when he was less furnish’d than now he is with that which makes him both without and within.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FRENCH.">
  <li>I have seen him in France. We had very many there could behold the sun with as firm eyes as he.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JACH.">
  <li>This matter of marrying his king’s daughter, wherein he must be weigh’d rather by her value than his own, words him, I doubt not, a great deal from the matter.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FRENCH.">
  <li data-number="5">And then his banishment.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JACH.">
  <li>Ay, and the approbation of those that weep this lamentable divorce under her colors are wonderfully to extend him, be it but to fortify her judgment, which else an easy battery might lay flat, for taking a beggar without less quality. But how comes it he is to sojourn with you? How creeps acquaintance?</li>
</ol>

</li>
  <li>Here comes the Britain. Let him be so entertain’d amongst you as suits with gentlemen of your knowing to a stranger of his quality. I beseech you all be better known to this gentleman, whom I commend to you as a noble friend of mine. How worthy he is I will leave to appear hereafter, rather than story him in his own hearing.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FRENCH.">
  <li>Sir, we have known together in Orléans.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POST.">
  <li data-number="10">Since when I have been debtor to you for courtesies, which I will be ever to pay and yet pay still.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FRENCH.">
  <li>Sir, you o’errate my poor kindness, I was glad I did atone my countryman and you. It had been pity you should have been put together, with so mortal a purpose as then each bore, upon importance of so slight and trivial a nature.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POST.">
  <li>By your pardon, sir, I was then a young traveler, rather shunn’d to go even with what I heard than in my every action to be guided by others’ experiences: but upon my mended judgment (if I offend not to say it is mended) my quarrel was not altogether slight.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FRENCH.">
  <li>Faith, yes, to be put to the arbiterment of swords, and by such two that would by all likelihood have confounded one the other, or have fall’n both.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JACH.">
  <li>Can we, with manners, ask what was the difference?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FRENCH.">
  <li data-number="15">Safely, I think; ’twas a contention in public, which may, without contradiction, suffer the report. It was much like an argument that fell out last night, where each of us fell in praise of our country mistresses; this gentleman at that time vouching (and upon warrant of bloody affirmation) his to be more fair, virtuous, wise, chaste, constant, qualified, and less attemptable than any the rarest of our ladies in France.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JACH.">
  <li>That lady is not now living; or this gentleman’s opinion by this worn out.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POST.">
  <li>She holds her virtue still, and I my mind.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JACH.">
  <li>You must not so far prefer her ’fore ours of Italy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POST.">
  <li>Being so far provok’d as I was in France, I would abate her nothing, though I profess myself her adorer, not her friend.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JACH.">
  <li data-number="20">As fair and as good—a kind of hand-in-hand comparison—had been something too fair and too good for any lady in Brittany. If she went before others I have seen, as that diamond of yours outlustres many I have beheld, I could not but believe she excell’d many. But I have not seen the most precious diamond that is, nor you the lady.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POST.">
  <li>I prais’d her as I rated her: so do I my stone.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JACH.">
  <li>What do you esteem it at?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POST.">
  <li>More than the world enjoys.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JACH.">
  <li>Either your unparagon’d mistress is dead, or she’s outpriz’d by a trifle.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POST.">
  <li data-number="25">You are mistaken: the one may be sold or given, or if there were wealth enough for the purchase, or merit for the gift; the other is not a thing for sale, and only the gift of the gods.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JACH.">
  <li>Which the gods have given you?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POST.">
  <li>Which, by their graces, I will keep.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JACH.">
  <li>You may wear her in title yours; but you know strange fowl light upon neighboring ponds. Your ring may be stol’n too: so your brace of unprizable estimations, the one is but frail and the other casual. A cunning thief, or a (that way) accomplish’d courtier, would hazard the winning both of first and last.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POST.">
  <li>Your Italy contains none so accomplish’d a courtier to convince the honor of my mistress, if in the holding or loss of that you term her frail. I do nothing doubt you have store of thieves; notwithstanding, I fear not my ring.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PHI.">
  <li data-number="30">Let us leave here, gentlemen.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POST.">
  <li>Sir, with all my heart. This worthy <foreign xml:lang="it">signior</foreign>, I thank him, makes no stranger of me: we are familiar at first.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JACH.">
  <li>With five times so much conversation, I should get ground of your fair mistress; make her go back, even to the yielding, had I admittance, and opportunity to friend.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POST.">
  <li>No, no.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JACH.">
  <li>I dare thereupon pawn the moi’ty of my estate to your ring, which in my opinion o’ervalues it something. But I make my wager rather against your confidence than her reputation; and to bar your offense herein too, I durst attempt it against any lady in the world.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POST.">
  <li data-number="35">You are a great deal abus’d in too bold a persuasion, and I doubt not you sustain what y’ are worthy of by your attempt.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JACH.">
  <li>What’s that?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POST.">
  <li>A repulse, though your attempt (as you call it) deserve more—a punishment too.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PHI.">
  <li>Gentlemen, enough of this. It came in too suddenly, let it die as it was born, and I pray you be better acquainted.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JACH.">
  <li>Would I had put my estate and my neighbor’s on th’ approbation of what I have spoke!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POST.">
  <li data-number="40">What lady would you choose to assail?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JACH.">
  <li>Yours, whom in constancy you think stands so safe. I will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring, that, commend me to the court where your lady is, with no more advantage than the opportunity of a second conference, and I will bring from thence that honor of hers which you imagine so reserv’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POST.">
  <li>I will wage against your gold, gold to it. My ring I hold dear as my finger, ’tis part of it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JACH.">
  <li>You are a friend, and therein the wiser. If you buy ladies’ flesh at a million a dram, you cannot preserve it from tainting. But I see you have some religion in you, that you fear.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POST.">
  <li>This is but a custom in your tongue; you bear a graver purpose, I hope.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JACH.">
  <li data-number="45">I am the master of my speeches, and would undergo what’s spoken, I swear.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POST.">
  <li>Will you? I shall but lend my diamond till your return. Let there be covenants drawn between ’s. My mistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness of your unworthy thinking. I dare you to this match: here’s my ring.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PHI.">
  <li>I will have it no lay.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JACH.">
  <li>By the gods, it is one. If I bring you no sufficient testimony that I have enjoy’d the dearest bodily part of your mistress, my ten thousand ducats are yours, so is your diamond too. If I come off and leave her in such honor as you have trust in, she your jewel, this your jewel, and my gold are yours—provided I have your commendation for my more free entertainment.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POST.">
  <li>I embrace these conditions, let us have articles betwixt us. Only, thus far you shall answer: if you make your voyage upon her and give me directly to understand you have prevail’d, I am no further your enemy; she is not worth our debate. If she remain unseduc’d, you not making it appear otherwise, for your ill opinion and th’ assault you have made to her chastity, you shall answer me with your sword.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JACH.">
  <li data-number="50">Your hand—a covenant. We will have these things set down by lawful counsel, and straight away for Britain, lest the bargain should catch cold and starve. I will fetch my gold and have our two wagers recorded.</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li>When Julius Caesar (whose remembrance yet</li>
  <li>Lives in men’s eyes, and will to ears and tongues</li>
  <li>Be theme and hearing ever) was in this Britain,</li>
  <li data-number="5">And conquer’d it, Cassibelan, thine uncle</li>
  <li>(Famous in Caesar’s praises, no whit less</li>
  <li>Than in his feats deserving it), for him</li>
  <li>And his succession granted Rome a tribute,</li>
  <li>Yearly three thousand pounds, which, by thee, lately</li>
  <li>Is left untender’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN.">
  <li data-offset="4">And to kill the marvel,</li>
  <li>Shall be so ever.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLO.">
  <li data-offset="3">There be many Caesars,</li>
  <li>Ere such another Julius. Britain’s a world</li>
  <li>By itself, and we will nothing pay</li>
  <li>For wearing our own noses.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN.">
  <li data-offset="5">That opportunity</li>
  <li data-number="15">Which then they had to take from ’s, to resume</li>
  <li>We have again. Remember, sir, my liege,</li>
  <li>The kings your ancestors, together with</li>
  <li>The natural bravery of your isle, which stands</li>
  <li>As Neptune’s park, ribb’d and pal’d in</li>
  <li data-number="20">With oaks unscalable and roaring waters,</li>
  <li>With sands that will not bear your enemies’ boats,</li>
  <li>But suck them up to th’ topmast. A kind of conquest</li>
  <li>Caesar made here, but made not here his brag</li>
  <li>Of “Came, and saw, and overcame.” With shame</li>
  <li data-number="25">(The first that ever touch’d him) he was carried</li>
  <li>From off our coast, twice beaten; and his shipping</li>
  <li>(Poor ignorant baubles!) on our terrible seas,</li>
  <li>Like egg-shells mov’d upon their surges, crack’d</li>
  <li>As easily ’gainst our rocks. For joy whereof</li>
  <li data-number="30">The fam’d Cassibelan, who was once at point</li>
  <li>(O giglet Fortune!) to master Caesar’s sword,</li>
  <li>Made Lud’s-Town with rejoicing fires bright,</li>
  <li>And Britains strut with courage.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLO.">
  <li>Come, there’s no more tribute to be paid. Our kingdom is stronger than it was at that time; and (as I said) there is no more such Caesars. Other of them may have crook’d noses, but to owe such straight arms, none.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CYM.">
  <li data-number="35">Son, let your mother end.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLO.">
  <li>We have yet many among us can gripe as hard as Cassibelan. I do not say I am one; but I have a hand. Why tribute? Why should we pay tribute? If Caesar can hide the sun from us with a blanket, or put the moon in his pocket, we will pay him tribute for light; else, sir, no more tribute, pray you now.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CYM.">
  <li>You must know,</li>
  <li>Till the injurious Romans did extort</li>
  <li>This tribute from us, we were free. Caesar’s ambition,</li>
  <li data-number="40">Which swell’d so much that it did almost stretch</li>
  <li>The sides o’ th’ world, against all color here</li>
  <li>Did put the yoke upon ’s; which to shake off</li>
  <li>Becomes a warlike people, whom we reckon</li>
  <li>Ourselves to be. We do say then to Caesar,</li>
  <li data-number="45">Our ancestor was that Mulmutius which</li>
  <li>Ordain’d our laws, whose use the sword of Caesar</li>
  <li>Hath too much mangled, whose repair and franchise</li>
  <li>Shall (by the power we hold) be our good deed,</li>
  <li>Though Rome be therefore angry. Mulmutius made our laws,</li>
  <li data-number="50">Who was the first of Britain which did put</li>
  <li>His brows within a golden crown and call’d</li>
  <li>Himself a king.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li data-offset="3">I am sorry, Cymbeline,</li>
  <li>That I am to pronounce Augustus Caesar</li>
  <li>(Caesar, that hath more kings his servants than</li>
  <li data-number="55">Thyself domestic officers) thine enemy.</li>
  <li>Receive it from me then: war and confusion</li>
  <li>In Caesar’s name pronounce I ’gainst thee; look</li>
  <li>For fury not to be resisted. Thus defied,</li>
  <li>I thank thee for myself.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CYM.">
  <li data-offset="5">Thou art welcome, Caius.</li>

  <li>That the Pannonians and Dalmatians for</li>
  <li data-number="65">Their liberties are now in arms, a president</li>

<ol data-speaker="PIS.">
  <li data-offset="6">But to win time</li>

<ol data-speaker="IMO.">
  <li data-offset="4">O, for such means,</li>

<ol data-speaker="PIS.">
  <li data-offset="4">Well then, here’s the point:</li>

  <li data-number="145">Command into obedience; fear and niceness</li>
  <li>(The handmaids of all women, or more truly</li>
  <li>Woman it pretty self) into a waggish courage,</li>

  <li>As quarrellous as the weasel; nay, you must</li>
  <li data-number="150">Forget that rarest treasure of your cheek,</li>
  <li>Exposing it (but O, the harder heart!</li>
  <li>Alack, no remedy!) to the greedy touch</li>
  <li>Of common-kissing Titan, and forget</li>
  <li>Your laborsome and dainty trims, wherein</li>
  <li>You made great Juno angry.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IMO.">
  <li data-number="155" data-offset="6">Nay, be brief:</li>
  <li>I see into thy end, and am almost</li>
  <li>A man already.</li>

  <li>Forethinking this, I have already fit</li>

  <li>Wherein you’re happy, which will make him know,</li>
  <li data-number="165">If that his head have ear in music, doubtless</li>
  <li>With joy he will embrace you; for he’s honorable,</li>
  <li>And doubling that, most holy. Your means abroad—</li>
  <li>You have me, rich, and I will never fail</li>
  <li>Beginning nor supplyment.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IMO.">
  <li data-offset="5">Thou art all the comfort</li>
  <li data-number="170">The gods will diet me with. Prithee away,</li>
  <li>There’s more to be consider’d; but we’ll even</li>
  <li>All that good time will give us. This attempt</li>
  <li>I am soldier to, and will abide it with</li>
  <li>A prince’s courage. Away, I prithee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PIS.">
  <li data-number="175">Well, madam, we must take a short farewell,</li>
  <li>Lest being miss’d, I be suspected of</li>
  <li>Your carriage from the court. My noble mistress,</li>
  <li>Here is a box, I had it from the Queen,</li>
  <li>What’s in’t is precious. If you are sick at sea,</li>
  <li data-number="180">Or stomach-qualm’d at land, a dram of this</li>
  <li>Will drive away distemper. To some shade,</li>
