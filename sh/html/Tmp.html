  <li>If by your art, my dearest father, you have</li>

  <li>The sky it seems would pour down stinking pitch,</li>
  <li>But that the sea, mounting to th’ welkin’s cheek,</li>
  <li data-number="5">Dashes the fire out. O! I have suffered</li>
  <li>With those that I saw suffer. A brave vessel</li>
  <li>(Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her)</li>
  <li>Dash’d all to pieces! O, the cry did knock</li>
  <li>Against my very heart. Poor souls, they perish’d.</li>
  <li data-number="10">Had I been any God of power, I would</li>

<ol data-speaker="PROS.">
  <li data-offset="6">The hour’s now come,</li>

  <li data-offset="7">’Tis far off;</li>

  <li>Thou hadst; and more, Miranda. But how is it</li>

  <li>Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MIR.">
  <li data-offset="6">O the heavens,</li>

  <li data-offset="5">Both, both, my girl.</li>

  <li data-offset="5">O, my heart bleeds</li>
  <li>To think o’ th’ teen that I have turn’d you to,</li>

<ol data-speaker="PROS.">
  <li>My brother and thy uncle, call’d Antonio—</li>
  <li>I pray thee mark me—that a brother should</li>
  <li>Be so perfidious!—he whom next thyself</li>
  <li>Of all the world I lov’d, and to him put</li>
  <li data-number="70">The manage of my state, as at that time</li>
  <li>Through all the signories it was the first,</li>
  <li>And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed</li>
  <li>In dignity, and for the liberal arts</li>
  <li>Without a parallel; those being all my study,</li>
  <li data-number="75">The government I cast upon my brother,</li>
  <li>And to my state grew stranger, being transported</li>
  <li>And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle—</li>
  <li>Dost thou attend me?</li>

<ol data-speaker="MIR.">
  <li data-offset="4">Sir, most heedfully.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROS.">
  <li>Being once perfected how to grant suits,</li>
  <li data-number="80">How to deny them, who t’ advance, and who</li>
  <li>To trash for overtopping, new created</li>
  <li>The creatures that were mine, I say, or chang’d ’em,</li>
  <li>Or else new form’d ’em; having both the key</li>
  <li>Of officer and office, set all hearts i’ th’ state</li>
  <li data-number="85">To what tune pleas’d his ear, that now he was</li>
  <li>The ivy which had hid my princely trunk,</li>

  <li>O, good sir, I do.</li>

  <li data-offset="4">I pray thee mark me.</li>

  <li>O’er-priz’d all popular rate, in my false brother</li>
  <li>Awak’d an evil nature, and my trust,</li>
  <li>Like a good parent, did beget of him</li>
  <li data-number="95">A falsehood in its contrary, as great</li>
  <li>As my trust was, which had indeed no limit,</li>

  <li>But what my power might else exact—like one</li>
  <li data-number="100">Who having into truth, by telling of it,</li>
  <li>Made such a sinner of his memory</li>
  <li>To credit his own lie—he did believe</li>
  <li>He was indeed the Duke, out o’ th’ substitution,</li>
  <li>And executing th’ outward face of royalty</li>
  <li>With all prerogative. Hence his ambition growing—</li>
  <li>Dost thou hear?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MIR.">
  <li data-offset="3">Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.</li>

<ol data-speaker="PROS.">
  <li>To have no screen between this part he play’d</li>

  <li>He thinks me now incapable; confederates</li>
  <li>(So dry he was for sway) wi’ th’ King of Naples</li>
  <li>To give him annual tribute, do him homage,</li>
  <li>Subject his coronet to his crown, and bend</li>
  <li>The dukedom yet unbow’d (alas, poor Milan!)</li>
  <li>To most ignoble stooping.</li>

  <li data-number="120" data-offset="7">Now the condition.</li>
  <li>This King of Naples, being an enemy</li>
  <li>To me inveterate, hearkens my brother’s suit,</li>
  <li>Which was, that he in lieu o’ th’ premises,</li>
  <li>Of homage, and I know not how much tribute,</li>
  <li data-number="125">Should presently extirpate me and mine</li>
  <li>Out of the dukedom, and confer fair Milan</li>
  <li>With all the honors on my brother; whereon,</li>
  <li>A treacherous army levied, one midnight</li>
  <li>Fated to th’ purpose, did Antonio open</li>
  <li data-number="130">The gates of Milan, and i’ th’ dead of darkness</li>
  <li>The ministers for th’ purpose hurried thence</li>

<ol data-speaker="MIR.">
  <li data-offset="5">Alack, for pity!</li>
  <li>I, not rememb’ring how I cried out then,</li>

  <li>So dear the love my people bore me; nor set</li>
  <li>A mark so bloody on the business; but</li>
  <li>With colors fairer painted their foul ends.</li>
  <li>In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,</li>
  <li data-number="145">Bore us some leagues to sea, where they prepared</li>
  <li>A rotten carcass of a butt, not rigg’d,</li>

  <li>’Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our return.</li>

<ol data-speaker="ADR.">
  <li>“Widow Dido,” said you? You make me study of that. She was of Carthage, not of Tunis.</li>

  <li>His word is more than the miraculous harp.</li>

  <li data-number="70">I think he will carry this island home in his pocket, and give it his son for an apple.</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANT.">
  <li>Why, in good time.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GON.">
  <li>Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage of your daughter, who is now queen.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANT.">
  <li data-number="75">And the rarest that e’er came there.</li>
</ol>

  <li>Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.</li>

<ol data-speaker="ANT.">
  <li>O, widow Dido? Ay, widow Dido.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GON.">
  <li>Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I wore it? I mean, in a sort.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANT.">
  <li>That ‘sort’ was well fish’d for.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GON.">
  <li data-number="80">When I wore it at your daughter’s marriage?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALON.">
  <li>You cram these words into mine ears against</li>
  <li>The stomach of my sense. Would I had never</li>
  <li>Married my daughter there! For coming thence,</li>
  <li>My son is lost and (in my rate) she too,</li>
  <li data-number="85">Who is so far from Italy removed</li>
  <li>I ne’er again shall see her. O thou mine heir</li>
  <li>Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish</li>
  <li>Hath made his meal on thee?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FRAN.">
  <li data-offset="6">Sir, he may live.</li>
  <li>I saw him beat the surges under him,</li>
  <li data-number="90">And ride upon their backs. He trod the water,</li>
  <li>Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted</li>
  <li>The surge most swoll’n that met him. His bold head</li>
  <li>’Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oared</li>
  <li>Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke</li>
  <li data-number="95">To th’ shore, that o’er his wave-worn basis bowed,</li>
  <li>As stooping to relieve him. I not doubt</li>
  <li>He came alive to land.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALON.">
  <li data-offset="5">No, no, he’s gone.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SEB.">
  <li>Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,</li>
  <li>That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,</li>
  <li data-number="100">But rather loose her to an African,</li>
  <li>Where she, at least, is banish’d from your eye,</li>
  <li>Who hath cause to wet the grief on’t.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALON.">
  <li data-offset="8">Prithee peace.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SEB.">
  <li>You were kneel’d to, and importun’d otherwise</li>
  <li>By all of us, and the fair soul herself</li>
  <li data-number="105">Weigh’d between loathness and obedience, at</li>
  <li>Which end o’ th’ beam should bow. We have lost your son,</li>
  <li>I fear forever. Milan and Naples have</li>
  <li>More widows in them of this business’ making</li>
  <li>Than we bring men to comfort them.</li>
  <li>The fault’s your own.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALON.">
  <li data-number="110" data-offset="4">So is the dear’st o’ th’ loss.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GON.">
  <li>My Lord Sebastian,</li>
  <li>The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SEB.">
  <li data-offset="7">Very well.</li>

  <li>He’d sow’t with nettle-seed.</li>

  <li>Scape being drunk, for want of wine.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GON.">
  <li>I’ th’ commonwealth I would, by contraries,</li>
  <li>Execute all things; for no kind of traffic</li>
  <li>Would I admit; no name of magistrate;</li>

  <li>No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;</li>

  <li>Of it own kind, all foison, all abundance,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SEB.">
  <li>No marrying ’mong his subjects?</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRIN.">
  <li>Here’s neither bush nor shrub to bear off any weather at all. And another storm brewing, I hear it sing i’ th’ wind. Yond same black cloud, yond huge one, looks like a foul bumbard that would shed his liquor. If it should thunder as it did before, I know not where to hide my head. Yond same cloud cannot choose but fall by pailfuls. What have we here? A man or a fish? Dead or alive? A fish, he smells like a fish; a very ancient and fish-like smell; a kind of, not-of-the-newest poor-John. A strange fish! Were I in England now (as once I was) and had but this fish painted, not a holiday fool there but would give a piece of silver. There would this monster make a man; any strange beast there makes a man. When they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar, they will lay out ten to see a dead Indian. Legg’d like a man; and his fins like arms! Warm, o’ my troth! I do now let loose my opinion, hold it no longer: this is no fish, but an islander, that hath lately suffer’d by a thunderbolt.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">
	Thunder.
	
	
</li>
  <li data-number="20">Alas, the storm is come again! My best way is to creep under his gaberdine; there is no other shelter hereabout. Misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows; I will here shroud till the dregs of the storm be past.</li>

  <li>Drink, servant-monster, when I bid thee. Thy eyes are almost set in thy head.</li>

  <li>Thou liest, most ignorant monster, I am in case to justle a constable. Why, thou debosh’d fish thou, was there ever man a coward that hath drunk so much sack as I today? Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie, being but half a fish and half a monster?</li>
</ol>

  <li>Lo, how he mocks me! Wilt thou let him, my lord?</li>

  <li>Mum then, and no more.—Proceed.</li>

<ol data-speaker="CAL.">
  <li>I say by sorcery he got this isle;</li>

  <li>Thou liest, thou canst not.</li>

<ol data-speaker="CAL.">
  <li>What a pied ninny’s this! Thou scurvy patch!</li>
  <li>I do beseech thy greatness, give him blows,</li>

<ol data-speaker="CAL.">
  <li>Ha, ha, ha!</li>

<ol data-speaker="STE.">
  <li data-number="50">Now forward with your tale.—Prithee stand further off.</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="STE.">
  <li data-offset="4">Stand farther.—Come, proceed.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAL.">
  <li>Why, as I told thee, ’tis a custom with him</li>
  <li>I’ th’ afternoon to sleep. There thou mayst brain him,</li>
  <li data-number="55">Having first seiz’d his books; or with a log</li>
  <li>Batter his skull, or paunch him with a stake,</li>
  <li>Or cut his wezand with thy knife. Remember</li>
  <li>First to possess his books; for without them</li>
  <li>He’s but a sot, as I am; nor hath not</li>
  <li data-number="60">One spirit to command: they all do hate him</li>
  <li>As rootedly as I. Burn but his books.</li>
  <li>He has brave utensils (for so he calls them)</li>
  <li>Which when he has a house, he’ll deck withal.</li>
  <li>And that most deeply to consider is</li>
  <li data-number="65">The beauty of his daughter. He himself</li>
  <li>Calls her a nonpareil. I never saw a woman</li>
  <li>But only Sycorax my dam and she;</li>
  <li>But she as far surpasseth Sycorax</li>
  <li>As great’st does least.</li>

  <li>And bring thee forth brave brood.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="STE.">
  <li>Monster, I will kill this man. His daughter and I will be king and queen—’save our Graces! And Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys. Dost thou like the plot, Trinculo?</li>

  <li>Excellent.</li>

  <li>Give me thy hand. I am sorry I beat thee; but while thou liv’st keep a good tongue in thy head.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAL.">
  <li>Within this half hour will he be asleep.</li>
  <li>Wilt thou destroy him then?</li>

  <li>This will I tell my master.</li>

  <li>Be not afeard, the isle is full of noises,</li>

  <li data-number="100">Ready to drop upon me, that when I wak’d</li>
  <li>I cried to dream again.</li>
