  <li>Search the market narrowly, Mytilene is full of gallants. We lost too much money this mart by being too wenchless.</li>

  <li>O, our credit comes not in like the commodity, nor the commodity wages not with the danger; therefore if in our youths we could pick up some pretty estate, ’twere not amiss to keep our door hatch’d.

<ol data-speaker="PER.">
  <li>Hail, Dian! To perform thy just command,</li>
  <li>I here confess myself the King of Tyre,</li>
  <li>Who frighted from my country, did wed</li>
  <li>At Pentapolis the fair Thaisa.</li>
  <li data-number="5">At sea in child-bed died she, but brought forth</li>
  <li>A maid-child call’d Marina, whom, O goddess,</li>
  <li>Wears yet thy silver livery. She at Tharsus</li>
  <li>Was nurs’d with Cleon, who at fourteen years</li>
  <li>He sought to murder, but her better stars</li>
  <li data-number="10">Brought her to Mytilene, ’gainst whose shore</li>
  <li>Riding, her fortunes brought the maid aboard us,</li>
  <li>Where, by her own most clear remembrance, she</li>
  <li>Made known herself my daughter.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="THAI.">
  <li data-offset="7">Voice and favor!</li>
  <li>You are, you are—O royal Pericles!</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Faints.
	
		THAI.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="PER.">
  <li data-number="15">What means the nun? She dies, help, gentlemen!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CER.">
  <li>Noble sir,</li>
  <li>If you have told Diana’s altar true,</li>
  <li>This is your wife.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PER.">
  <li data-offset="4">Reverent appearer, no,</li>
  <li>I threw her overboard with these very arms.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CER.">
  <li>Upon this coast, I warrant you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PER.">
  <li data-number="20" data-offset="6">’Tis most certain.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CER.">
  <li>Look to the lady; O, she’s but overjoy’d.</li>
  <li>Early in blustering morn this lady was</li>
  <li>Thrown upon this shore. I op’d the coffin,</li>
  <li>Found there rich jewels, recovered her, and plac’d her</li>
  <li>Here in Diana’s temple.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PER.">
  <li data-number="25" data-offset="5">May we see them?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CER.">
  <li>Great sir, they shall be brought you to my house,</li>
  <li>Whither I invite you. Look, Thaisa is</li>
  <li>Recovered.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="THAI.">
  <li data-offset="3">O, let me look!</li>
  <li>If he be none of mine, my sanctity</li>
  <li data-number="30">Will to my sense bend no licentious ear,</li>
  <li>But curb it, spite of seeing. O my lord,</li>
  <li>Are you not Pericles? Like him you spake,</li>
  <li>Like him you are! Did you not name a tempest,</li>
  <li>A birth, and death?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PER.">
  <li data-offset="4">The voice of dead Thaisa!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="THAI.">
  <li data-number="35">That Thaisa am I, supposed dead</li>
  <li>And drown’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PER.">
  <li>Immortal Dian!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="THAI.">
  <li data-offset="4">Now I know you better.</li>
  <li>When we with tears parted Pentapolis,</li>
  <li>The King my father gave you such a ring.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Points to his ring.
	
		THAI.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="PER.">
  <li data-number="40">This, this. No more, you gods! Your present kindness</li>
  <li>Makes my past miseries sports. You shall do well</li>
  <li>That on the touching of her lips I may</li>
  <li>Melt, and no more be seen. O, come, be buried</li>
  <li>A second time within these arms.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MAR.">
  <li data-offset="7">My heart</li>

</div>

<ol data-speaker="PER.">
  <li>Look who kneels here! Flesh of thy flesh, Thaisa,</li>
  <li>Thy burden at the sea, and call’d Marina</li>
  <li>For she was yielded there.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="THAI.">
  <li data-offset="5">Blest, and mine own!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HEL.">
  <li>Hail, madam, and my queen!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="THAI.">
  <li data-offset="6">I know you not.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PER.">
  <li data-number="50">You have heard me say, when I did fly from Tyre,</li>
  <li>I left behind an ancient substitute.</li>
  <li>Can you remember what I call’d the man?</li>
  <li>I have nam’d him oft.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="THAI.">
  <li data-offset="4">’Twas Helicanus then.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PER.">
  <li>Still confirmation!</li>
  <li data-number="55">Embrace him, dear Thaisa, this is he.</li>
  <li>Now do I long to hear how you were found,</li>
  <li>How possibly preserved, and who to thank</li>
  <li>(Besides the gods) for this great miracle.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="THAI.">
  <li>Lord Cerimon, my lord; this man,</li>
  <li>Through whom the gods have shown their power; that can</li>
  <li>From first to last resolve you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PER.">
  <li data-offset="6">Reverent sir,</li>
  <li>The gods can have no mortal officer</li>
  <li>More like a god than you. Will you deliver</li>
  <li>How this dead queen relives?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CER.">
  <li data-offset="6">I will, my lord.</li>
  <li data-number="65">Beseech you first, go with me to my house,</li>
  <li>Where shall be shown you all was found with her;</li>
  <li>How she came plac’d here in the temple;</li>
  <li>No needful thing omitted.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PER.">
  <li data-offset="5">Pure Dian,</li>
  <li>I bless thee for thy vision, and will offer</li>
  <li data-number="70">Night-oblations to thee. Thaisa,</li>
  <li>This prince, the fair-betrothed of your daughter,</li>
  <li>Shall marry her at Pentapolis. And now</li>
  <li>This ornament</li>
  <li>Makes me look dismal will I clip to form,</li>
  <li data-number="75">And what this fourteen years no razor touch’d,</li>
  <li>To grace thy marriage-day, I’ll beautify.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="THAI.">
  <li>Lord Cerimon hath letters of good credit, sir,</li>
  <li>My father’s dead.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PER.">
  <li>Heavens make a star of him! Yet there, my queen,</li>
  <li data-number="80">We’ll celebrate their nuptials, and ourselves</li>
  <li>Will in that kingdom spend our following days.</li>
  <li>Our son and daughter shall in Tyrus reign.</li>
  <li>Lord Cerimon, we do our longing stay</li>
  <li>To hear the rest untold. Sir, lead ’s the way.</li>
