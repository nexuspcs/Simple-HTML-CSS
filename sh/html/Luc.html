<h1 id="title">The Rape of Lucrece</h1>

<section id="poemintro">
To the Right Honorable, Henry Wriothesley, Earle of Southhampton, and Baron of Titchfield.<br>The love I dedicate to your Lordship is without end: whereof this Pamphlet without beginning is but a superfluous Moity. The warrant I have of your Honorable disposition, not the worth of my untutored Lines makes it assured of acceptance. What I have done is yours, what I have to do is yours, being part in all I have, devoted yours. Were my worth greater, my duty would shew greater, mean time, as it is, it is bound to your Lordship; To whom I wish long life still lengthened with all happiness.<br>Your Lordships in all duty.<br>William Shakespeare.

<h2 class="subtitle">The Argument</h2>

  <p>Lucius Tarquinius (for his excessive pride surnamed Superbus), after he had caused his own father-in-law Servius Tullius to be cruelly murd’red, and contrary to the Roman laws and customs, not requiring or staying for the people’s suffrages, had possessed himself of the kingdom, went, accompanied with his sons and other noblemen of Rome, to besiege Ardea; during which siege, the principal men of the army meeting one evening at the tent of Sextus Tarquinius, the King’s son, in their discourses after supper every one commended the virtues of his own wife; among whom Collatinus extolled the incomparable chastity of his wife Lucretia. In that pleasant humor they all posted to Rome, and intending by their secret and sudden arrival to make trial of that which every one had before avouched, only Collatinus finds his wife (though it were late in the night) spinning amongest her maids; the other ladies were all found dancing and reveling, or in several disports; whereupon the noblemen yielded Collatinus the victory, and his wife the fame. At that time Sextus Tarquinius being inflamed with Lucrece’ beauty, yet smothering his passions for the present, departed with the rest back to the camp; from whence he shortly after privily withdrew himself, and was (according to his estate) royally entertained and lodged by Lucrece at Collatium. The same night he treacherously stealeth into her chamber, violently ravish’d her, and early in the morning speedeth away. Lucrece, in this lamentable plight, hastily dispatcheth messengers, one to Rome for her father, another to the camp for Collatine. They came, the one accompanied with Junius Brutus, the other with Publius Valerius; and finding Lucrece attired in mourning habit, demanded the cause of her sorrow. She, first taking an oath of them for her revenge, revealed the actor, and whole manner of his dealing, and withal suddenly stabbed herself. Which done, with one consent they all vowed to root out the whole hated family of the Tarquins; and bearing the dead body to Rome, Brutus acquainted the people with the doer and manner of the vile deed; with a bitter invective against the tyranny of the King, wherewith the people were so moved, that with one consent and a general acclamation the Tarquins were all exiled, and the state government changed from kings to consuls.</p>

  <p>From the besieged Ardea all in post,</p>
  <p>Borne by the trustless wings of false desire,</p>
  <p>Lust-breathed Tarquin leaves the Roman host,</p>
  <p>And to Collatium bears the lightless fire,</p>
  <p>Which in pale embers hid, lurks to aspire,</p>
<section class="couplet">
  <p>And girdle with embracing flames the waist</p>
  <p>Of Collatine’s fair love, Lucrece the chaste.</p>

<section class="stanza">
  <p>Happ’ly that name of “chaste” unhapp’ly set</p>
  <p>This bateless edge on his keen appetite;</p>

  <p>Which triumph’d in that sky of his delight;</p>

  <p>Where mortal stars as bright as heaven’s beauties,</p>
  <p>With pure aspects did him peculiar duties.</p>

<section class="stanza">
  <p>For he the night before, in Tarquin’s tent,</p>
  <p>Unlock’d the treasure of his happy state;</p>
  <p>What priceless wealth the heavens had him lent</p>
  <p>In the possession of his beauteous mate;</p>
  <p>Reck’ning his fortune at such high proud rate</p>
<section class="couplet">
  <p>That kings might be espoused to more fame,</p>

  <p>O happiness enjoy’d but of a few,</p>

  <p>Honor and beauty, in the owner’s arms,</p>

<section class="stanza">
  <p>Beauty itself doth of itself persuade</p>
  <p>The eyes of men without an orator;</p>
  <p>What needeth then apology be made</p>

  <p>Or why is Collatine the publisher</p>
<section class="couplet">
  <p>Of that rich jewel he should keep unknown</p>
  <p>From thievish ears because it is his own?</p>
</section>
</section>

<section class="stanza">
  <p>Perchance his boast of Lucrece’ sov’reignty</p>
  <p>Suggested this proud issue of a king;</p>
  <p>For by our ears our hearts oft tainted be;</p>
  <p>Perchance that envy of so rich a thing,</p>
  <p>Braving compare, disdainfully did sting</p>
<section class="couplet">
  <p>His high-pitch’d thoughts, that meaner men should vaunt</p>
  <p>That golden hap which their superiors want.</p>

</section>

<section class="stanza">
  <p>But some untimely thought did instigate</p>
  <p>His all too timeless speed, if none of those.</p>
  <p>His honor, his affairs, his friends, his state,</p>
  <p>Neglected all, with swift intent he goes</p>
  <p>To quench the coal which in his liver glows.</p>

<section class="stanza">
  <p>When at Collatium this false lord arrived,</p>
  <p>Well was he welcom’d by the Roman dame,</p>
  <p>Within whose face beauty and virtue strived</p>
  <p>Which of them both should underprop her fame.</p>
  <p>When virtue bragg’d, beauty would blush for shame;</p>
<section class="couplet">
  <p>When beauty boasted blushes, in despite</p>
  <p>Virtue would stain that o’er with silver white.</p>

<section class="stanza">
  <p>But beauty, in that white entituled</p>
  <p>From Venus’ doves, doth challenge that fair field;</p>
  <p>Then virtue claims from beauty beauty’s red,</p>
  <p>Which virtue gave the golden age to gild</p>
  <p>Their silver cheeks, and call’d it then their shield,</p>
<section class="couplet">
  <p>Teaching them thus to use it in the fight,</p>
  <p>When shame assail’d, the red should fence the white.</p>

<section class="stanza">
  <p>This heraldry in Lucrece’ face was seen,</p>

<section class="stanza">
  <p>This silent war of lilies and of roses,</p>

  <p>The coward captive vanquished doth yield</p>

  <p>Now thinks he that her husband’s shallow tongue,</p>

  <p>Therefore that praise which Collatine doth owe,</p>

  <p>Now leaden slumber with live’s strength doth fight,</p>

  <p>The one doth call her his, the other his,</p>

  <p>“O,” quoth Lucretius, “I did give that life</p>

  <p>Brutus, who pluck’d the knife from Lucrece’ side,</p>

  <p>Why, Collatine, is woe the cure for woe?</p>
